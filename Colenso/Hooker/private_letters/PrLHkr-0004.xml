      Royal Gardens Kew</p>
            <p>March 10/83</p>
            <p>My dear Von Haast</p>
            <p>I am desirous of proposing Colenso for the Royal Society, &amp; it is very essential for 
this purpose that his Certificate should have the signatures 
of the Fellows in the Colony 
–
You could therefore oblige me by signing in the column below my name. Darwin would 
gladly 
[2] 
have signed had he been alive, for he knew Colenso when in the 
Beagle
! 
–
is this 
not like going back 
generations
in the history of Science, &amp; to the very dawn of New Zealand 
science!
We are as busy or rather busier than ever here, as the Kew Reports will show you, &amp; 
the work of the Establishment has become very laborious, leaving little time for 
[3] 
personal 
correspondence.</p>
            <p>I hear of you sometimes indirectly, &amp; of your splendid Museum, &amp; I am a devoted 
reader of the Transactions of your N.Z. Institute.</p>
            <p>The “Genera Plantarum” is finished at last, thanks to Bentham’s indefatigable 
industry &amp; his liberality for he has
provided 
nearly all
the funds. He is now in his 83rd year &amp; 
very feeble, but he comes to Kew 3 days a week from London where he lives.
[4]</p>
            <p>No one has succeeded with your noble Alpine 
Ranunculi
; &amp; 
R. lyallii
&amp; one or 2 
others have been raised repeatedly, 
but not even the most skilful gardeners can keep them 
alive. It is the same or nearly so with 
Celmisias &amp; with 
Cordyline indivisa
. The other 
Cordylines grow and flower
luxuriantly with no attention. 
Myosotidium nobile
is another 
instance of a plant often flowered but which will not be kept afterwards.</p>
            <p>Ever my dear Von Haast</p>
            <p>very sincerely yours</p>
            <p>Jos. D. Hooker.</p>
