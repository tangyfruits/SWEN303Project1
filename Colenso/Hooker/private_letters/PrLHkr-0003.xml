      Royal Gardens Kew</p>
            <p>Nov 7/79</p>
            <p>My dear Haast</p>
            <p>I have just received your kind present of the Geology of 
Canterbury &amp; Westland, 
which I am reading with great interest. How I should have enjoyed the exploration of the Mt 
Cook Glaciers with you, though I should gladly have been spared the sight of our poor friend 
Sinclairs disaster. I assure you that I am very 
proud of “my 
[2] 
Glacier”. The notices of plants 
interest me very much, especially the 
Veronicas &amp; 
Aciphylla
. 
V. traversii
is one of the 
hardiest plants we have, but is the only species that has (unprotected) stood a single winter
at 
Kew. We have now 
V. ly
copodioides
alive! but there is not a tithe of the New Zealand Flora 
in cultivation in England, &amp; we still above all want the 
Celmisias, 
Olearias, the 
[3] 
Senecias, 
Raoulias. I suppose however that your scrambling days are over 
–
&amp; I must live in the 
delig
htful memory of the enthusiasm with which I used to unpack the bundles of Treasures 
that the C.O. bag brought from you. I still hope that Kirk or some competent botanist will 
publish a 
2n Edition
of 
the 
N.Z. Flora</p>
            <p>Dr Berggren has been at Kew for some mon
ths working up his Cryptogams. He seems 
to have been a good deal disappointed in the want of novelty which he met 
[4] 
with which 
surprises me; as 
except
Colenso &amp; you &amp; I, no one had collected Musci or Hepaticae to any 
extent in the Islands. </p>
            <p>Dr. B. did not however visit Milford Sound or Dusky Bay where most novelty was to 
be expected.
We are tremendously busy here 
–
the duties increase, the collections accumulate &amp; 
the correspondence requires to 
exceed all
bound
s.
</p>
            <p>Ever my dear Dr Haast</p>
            <p>Very sincerely yours</p>
            <p>Jos. D. Hooker</p>
