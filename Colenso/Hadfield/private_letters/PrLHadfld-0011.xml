      <p>Mr. Broughton's</p>
      <p>Swan Yard,</p>
      <p>Holborn Hill,</p>
      <p>Jan. 31st. 1838</p>
      <p>My dear Father,</p>
      <p>I wrote a few hurried lines to my mother last evening and now write a few more to you today chiefly to say that I think there is not much chance of the ship's sailing until next week.  I shall therefore have time to get all that I want, and I hope I shall hear from home, as I fear from my letter of yesterday that you might think I might be off before I could hear from you.  I am much pleased with the ship and my cabin.  I might have a cabin on the poop, I should have more air and light, but much more noise and other inconveniences.  I liked the look of the Captain he appeared a gentlemanlike fellow.  There are, I think, ten passengers and I am not aware that there are any emigrants.  </p>
      <p>I heard from George today.  I saw Mr. Warren; he said when I found out what I wanted he would give me the money to pay for them.  I shall see him in town again tomorrow and hope he is well.  He told me he heard from you on Monday.  I have been busy all day and am now going to pass the evening with Mr. Jowett.  I want to hear from you while I can.  I hope you are better.  Tell some of my sisters to write to me.</p>
      <p>Letters put into the post addressed to me at New Zealand via Sydney will reach me without difficulty.</p>
      <p>I called on Cap. Duff today but he was out.  If  the ship does not sail until next week I shall be able to see some of our friends in town.  I send my kind regards to all.  Give my love to all at home, and believe me ever,</p>
      <p>Your affectionate son,</p>
      <p>Octavius Hadfield./
      <p>I have just written to George.</p>
      <p>I write in haste.</p>
