      <p>New Zealand.</p>
      <p>August 27th. 1839</p>
      <p>My dear Maria,</p>
      <p>You and Julia are, I think, the only ones of my dearest relatives at home that I have not written to since I left England, but I intend all my letters to be common property &amp; what I write to one I mean for all.  Two or three objects at a distance, if near one another, appear but as one object, &amp; to my mind's eye you all appear one.  I can scarcely think of one of you separately, &amp; I trust you are all one in love &amp; affection, &amp; oh, may you all be one in dear &amp; Beloved Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, members, branches producing fruit, by strength received from the living vine, the same Saviour. </p>
      <p>The last I have heard of you is by Octavia's letters of Jan. 15 for which I am very thankful.  I fear she has not been very well.  I rejoice however, that on the whole you are doing well.  My father appears to be well &amp; my dear mother tolerably so.  It refreshes me so much to hear of you.  I have to thank you for a letter dated Sep. which I received in July.  It was however, tho' old, not the less interesting as it contained more of specific &amp; particular information than any letters I have received.  Every little event affords me something to recall to my mind some pleasing ideas.  I am sorry that Henry's trip to France did not answer his expectations.  I do hope he may be able to live &amp; enjoy tolerable health in England.  I hope Charlotte &amp; the little ones are doing well.  I am sorry also that dear George does not appear settled, &amp; that he still suffers from his chest.  I do pray &amp; trust that the Lord will guide him &amp; dispose of him according to His own will &amp; enable him to feel that he is in the hands of one Who orders all things for His own glory primarily &amp; for the good of His children.  Charles, I hear, is still in England tho' I suppose by this time that he must be at sea.  When you write to him give my affectionate love to him.  I have seen papers up to March 28th.  England, both as to her domestic &amp; likewise foreign relations, appears in a very lamentable state.  I can expect nothing better for her so long as she encourages as a nation popery &amp; infidelity of every kind.  I hope there will be no war with America.  I have just been writing to dear Alexander; I have not written to him for a long time.  </p>
      <p>I suppose by my letters, tho' I have generally written in a hurry, you have by this time gleaned what my opinions are concerning the N.Z. mission, &amp; if you give any weight to my powers of discerning &amp; my opinions you must grieve with me on account of the state of things here.  I will not again repeat what I have before stated but I must repeat that my opinion does not alter.  The worldly-mindedness of the missionaries, their connexion with temporal affairs, their anxiety for the worldly advancement of their children, their unwillingness to proceed to those parts of the Island where they are most wanted, their ignorance of the Bible, their want of faith, &amp; lastly their total insensibility of this their cold formal state, are to me distressing and alarming symptoms; tho' Satan, tho' the flesh, tho' the world would draw me to the same course, I cannot but regard with sorrow &amp; grief, nay, with disapprobation, &amp; almost with disgust.  And when I see the attacks make in the Colonial papers against this mission, the substance of which I know to be true, I do almost feel ashamed of being connected with ti.  I did once think that as a missionary I should have to bear the taunts, the scoffs, the reproahes of an ungodly world, yes, that as a humble follower of Christ I should have on His account to bear the cross after my divine Master, but I must confess that I was not prepared for, what?  Reproaches for conformity to Christ &amp; deadness to the world?  No, but reproaches for conformity to the world, by the world.  An English man the other day on the Rev. H.W. speaking to him about religion, replied that he did not like trading missionaries, he did not consider the preaching of the Gospel &amp; trading consistent in the same persons.  This was much laughed at here, but I thought it correct.  All these things had almost induced me to leave N.Z. &amp; go to the Colony, i.e. N.S.W. &amp; I am not certain that this may not eventually be my course if the Parent Committee approve of the large purchases of land made here by missionaries, etc.  But I now see my way plain for the present.  I have in my former letters expressed my dislike of the school &amp; my wish of giving myself up exclusively to ministerial work &amp; had determined to leave the school, had actually written (tho' not delivered) a letter to the C.M. here telling them this, &amp; desiring to be sent to the southern part of the Island.  But I have now received instructions from the Parent Com. to go to the southward so that it is my intention, tho' matters are not quite arranged yet, to go as soon as possible.  The plan we expect to put into execution is for the Rev. R. Taylor to take the school, &amp; for the Rev. W.W. &amp; myself to go to Turanga, i.e. Poverty Bay, where there are 4,000 natives, besides several thousand in the neighbourhood.  What I should more decidedly wish, but it is not at present feasible, inasmuch as I am unacquainted with the language, would be to go to some place by myself.  Almost everybody here laughs at the idea for many reasons that I think beneath the consideration of a christian, much more so of a minister of Christ, but some agree with me &amp; those whose opinions I value most.  My opinions here with respect to missionary work are considered new &amp; visionary but they are those which I have always held, being founded, I believe upon the Bible, &amp; which I have seen no occasion hitherto to change.  I <hi rend="underline">always</hi> have, &amp; shall, reprobate the idea of mixing up civilisation with the Gospel of Christ.  Trying to raise the mind &amp; affections heaven-ward &amp; at the same time drawing them to worldly things appears to me absurd, &amp; it is a fact here that does not admit of dispute, that the Gospel has prospered most at places distant some 10 or 20 miles from the missionary stations.  I wish to live as much as possible among the natives, (a thing which has been too much neglected here) regardless of personal inconvenience, seeking only the glory of God &amp; the welfare of souls.  I wish to let the Glorious Gospel work its own way without the aid of worldly things, having nothing to recommend it but its own intrinsic excellency &amp; the devotedness of the ambassador of Christ by whom it is preached.  When I read of the labours of St. Paul, his trials &amp; sufferings, I do wish to live at a higher rate than missionaries are accustomed to in these days.  Oh, may the Lord strengthen me &amp; keep me close to Christ.  I have not been at all well the last few months; my chest has suffered but I have managed to get thro' my duties.  The confinement of the school does not suit me at all, &amp; the great elevation of Waimate makes it bad for me.  The climate of this country is lovely &amp; I expect to get my health when I begin to have my mind more comfortable in missionary work.  However I am in the hands of my dear Lord &amp; Master in Whom I can daily rejoice with joy unspeakable, &amp; full of glory while waiting for His appearance.  Do, my dear Maria, &amp; oh, may all the others of you, pray for me, yet pray much, for I do assure you that I attribute all the good done here (looking to the second cause) to the prayers of God's saints in England &amp; not to the exertions of the missionaries.  Yet pray much! &amp; pray that I may pray.  We have now a Popish Bishop here, &amp; seven <!--amended in MS annotation; original typed word was "Jesuit"--> priests who are propagating error &amp; helping the powers of darkness.  I get into trouble here because I condemn their errors as the work of the devil but oh! may the Lord enable me to speak boldly as I ought to speak &amp; care for no man whether he be my friend or foe.  The natives however, I rejoice, are willing &amp; receive us all over the Island &amp; treat us with great respect, with the exception of a few hardened revilers of Christ &amp; His servants.  I have written now in much haste, excuse all faults, yours with much love &amp; affection,   
      </p>
