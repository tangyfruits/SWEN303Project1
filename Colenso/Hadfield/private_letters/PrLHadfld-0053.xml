      <p>Wellington,</p>
      <p>New Zealand.</p>
      <p>August 4th., 1845</p>
      <p>My dear Mother,</p>
      <p>I have lately had the pleasure of receiving a few precious lines which you wrote in Amelia's letter of Feb. the pleasure however which they afforded me was not unmixed with pain, when I reflected upon the anxiety which I occasioned you, and which my subsequent letters would rather increase than relieve, still I derive comfort from considering that (of late years) you have learnt to acquiesce in the Divine dispensations, and to feel practically that Jehovah, the God of the Universe, the Father of his believing people, doeth all things well; it has been very delightful to me to receive reports generally satisfactory with respect to you all by the various letters which I have received since I last wrote, be so kind as to thank A. O. M. and G. for their respective letters, I purpose writing to H. to thank him myself for his of Feb.  You will probably have concluded from the general tenor of my letters that ere this I should have ceased to write, that was my own opinion as well as that of those around me a few months ago, but by the goodness of God I am now suffering less than I was, and feeling rather stronger, the care and attention bestowed on me - which you fancied I could not have in N.Z. - have been the means, under God's blessing of enabling me to live in comparative comfort, &amp; even to improved in health, tho' regularly confined to my bed as I have been during the last eight months I feel able to rise more frequently now, in order to have my bed made than I did, and sit up for a short time without much inconvenience.  I sometimes also when the weather is very beautiful, walk for a few minutes in the garden; for tho' it increases my pain, it prevents my becoming so weak as bed otherwise would make me.  I pass the greater part of my time in reading, for tho' I frequently suffer from headache - I still feel the full command of my mental faculties, and consequently derive pleasure from books.  The kindness of my dear friends here knows no bounds, I indeed feel thankful to God when I reflect on the innumerable blessings and favours which he has bestowed upon me all my life.  When I consider what a foolish rebellious creature I have always been from my childhood to the present hour, and then consider how highly I have been blessed with every spiritual and earthly blessing, I am constrained to say "To the Lord my God belong mercies, but to me belongs the confusion of face."  I have had another medical man brought to see me; he agrees entirely with those who have previously seen me as to the nature of my complaint - he says tho' I can never recover from it, or be able to do any work, still I may continue to live in comparative comfort by taking care.  It is natural to wish to be useful and to be actively engaged, but to wish it after we are convinced that it is no longer the Lord's will, is palpable folly, of which I trust I shall not be guilty for it would seem to imply that we put some value on our own labours, or at least that we know better than God Himself, what His own will was, or what would tend most to His glory.  Whatever estimate others may put upon my poor endeavours to serve God in His church in this land, I at least know, and the searcher of hearts knows, how much of imperfection and sin has been mixed up with them, and how many my sinful omissions have been.  When I had health and strength wherewith to serve God, in His church, I could rejoice in the work which He had appointed me among the heathen, and thank Him for the blessed privilege I professed, now that He has taken from me that strength which He gave, I can equally rejoice because my present exemption from work and responsibility is in accordance with His will, and designed for my eternal good.  You feel, I perceive by your letters, for my late flock, who are now deprived of me: but what am I? or what is man?  I have loved them; and love them still: but God has loved those who are His eternally, and will love them eternally: He will provide, I have committed them to Him.  (I would not wish to encroach on <!--previous editor's note: [torn]--> prerogative.)  He will take care of His own.  How I wonder at the presumption of those who act and talk as if they thought the church of God needed their services.</p>
      <p>Mr. Govett, who was ordained deacon on Trinity Sunday is now, for the present, stationed at Waikanae.  He is quite young, what his efficiency may be for the position remains to be seen; I like the little I know of him.  I occasionally see natives from Waikanae and Otaki, they lament my removal from them, but say they trust never to forget the instructions I have imparted to them.  Mrs. St. Hill received the letter you wrote to her; she will write to you now.  Were I not so comfortable here, I think I should venture to attempt a voyage to England, but I can scarcely make up my mind upon the subject.  I sometimes think I ought not to be so troublesome to these kind friends.  When they will neither allow me to live by myself, or to live with Mr. Taylor or any other friend, you need not imagine that I could have any comfort in England that I do not already possess here.  I should indeed, if I thought it the will of God, wish to see you all again, but I scarcely know whether I should be justified in making the attempt.  Mr. Shortland, a physician brother of the late Colonial Secretary, purposes going to England in about two months and he has kindly offered to accompany and take charge of me, if it should be thought advisable at that time that I should make the attempt.  I just mention this as it occurs to me, without at all intending to intimate that I have determined on any step.  God will direct me and dispose of me, that is sufficient for us; may we learn to look continually to Heavenly things, and to desire more and more communion with God on earth, and a speedy admission into His presence in Heaven!  Give my kindest love to all, and believe me, as ever,</p>
      <p>Your very affectionate son,
      </p>
      <p>Octavius Hadfield.</p>
