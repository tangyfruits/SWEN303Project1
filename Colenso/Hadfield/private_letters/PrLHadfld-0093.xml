I read it aloud to them.  Afterwards I said Eruiua do you approve of what is contained in this Petition?  He replied that he did.  I asked are you willing to attach your name to this Petition?  He replied I am.  I said to him hold the pen- His hand held the pen- I then wrote his name.  And so with reference to Matioro.  I enquired of him, he assented and I held the pen.  Their two names were written -- these names attached to seal the Petition.  These are the names of the <!--previous editor's note: [torn]--> who saw them sign their names.
