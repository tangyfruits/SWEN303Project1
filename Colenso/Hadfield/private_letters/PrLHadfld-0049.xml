      <p>Otaki,</p>
      <p>New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Oct. 8. 1844</p>
      <p>My dear George,</p>
      <p>I wrote only a few weeks since to my mother, but finding that the ship will not sail for a day or two, I gladly avail myself of the further opportunity afforded me of writing, to do so.  I am happy to be able to say that I am feeling very much better now than I did when I wrote before: I have gained strength considerably &amp; am feeling much less pain than I did then: in fact the nice warm weather that has now set in seems to have had a very beneficial effect upon me already; under the circumstances - without professing to give any very encouraging account of myself - I feel bound <supplied>[to]</supplied> say that I am at present in an improving state of health.  Last Sunday I had a very large congregation here, from which I had been absent a long time, &amp; though I exerted myself, perhaps a little imprudently, both in the morning &amp; evening services,  I do not feel that I have suffered from it.  It is difficult - very difficult - for us to keep within the bounds of prudence when engaged as ambassadors for God to deliver the message of peace to our poor fellow-sinners standing on the verge of eternity!  No cold calculations of frustrating future exertions, or of shortening our period of usefulness can find place within us.  While we would not rashly attempt what appeared physically beyond our strength; still - as addressing immortal souls whom we may never meet again till we wait before the Judgement Seat of Christ - we cannot tie ourselves to medical rules &amp; regulations!  Do not fancy from the strain in which I find I have unintentionally begun to write that I allow either zeal or enthusiasm to carry me away beyond the bounds which reason would define; no it is far otherwise!  Still when the prospect of death bids me reflect: when memory and conscience together begin to do their united work more faithfully than they in times of health are wont, &amp; past negligences, opportunities lost &amp; general unfaithfulness present themselves to my mind - how can I determine otherwise than to devote henceforward my remaining energy to the service of God!  I was endeavouring to reflect, the day before yesterday, upon my past life: how many sins!! how many mercies!!  Thanks be to God the latter prevail!  Where sin has abounded grace abounds more.  My sins, being the sins of a creature - innumerable as they appear to me - are finite: the merit of the death of the Son of God must necessarily be infinite!  I want <!--preceding sentence added to typescript as MS annotation - this word somewhat unclear--> consolation for the hour of death when all one's sins may crowd upon the mind to be able to oppose to them the infinite merits of the death of Christ.   Would that I had habitually possessed more holy zeal for the glory of God in Christ, more tender compassion for the precious souls of my fellow-sinners: &amp; a more deep &amp; heart-felt conviction of the momentous nature of that trust committed to me in the ministry!</p>
      <p>I have lately had Mr. Taylor (Mr. Mason's successor at Wanganui) staying with me for a few days. He is exceedingly kind &amp; is very anxious about me.  I really feel quite sorry sometimes that my friends here take so much interest in me.  I must, however, thank God, the giver of all good for raising me up so many kind affectionate friends in this land when I scarcely could expect to meet with any.  My dear people here are quite delighted to have me among them again, &amp; I think I can say that I am equally delighted to be once more enabled to encourage &amp; direct &amp; warn them concerning the interests of their souls.  I am afraid, from some late communications, that the Ch. Miss. Society Committee are still ill-informed concerning the real state of religion in this country. Perhaps nothing is more difficult than to convey adequate ideas of the actual religious feelings &amp; knowledge of a newly converted barbarous people to those who have no experimental knowledge of a people of this description. The Committee talk of introducing the parochial system under a native ministry into this country: &amp; have written for advice &amp; opinions upon the subject.  I have written very shortly in answer to their inquiries.  I felt half inclined to have written at considerable length upon the subject, but as the Bishop will write, I perhaps need not.  The scheme at present is impracticable; &amp; as there is no such progressive advance in religious and moral knowledge, as could lead the most acute discerner of future probable events to calculate with any likelihood of being correct, what would be the difference in this respect 5, 10, or 15 years hence.  Besides, the uncertainty of the present system of colonisation, whether it will be carried on with more vigour or be relaxed, &amp; the effect of this upon the natives, renders it, at present, perfectly preposterous to suppose it possible just at this time to entertain the idea seriously. There is an  uneasiness and anxiety about the natives relative to the acts of government &amp; the probable results to which they may tend as influencing their interests which is far from satisfactory; &amp; I am perfectly convinced that without the aid and assistance of the present missionaries in allaying the fears and apprehensions of the natives upon many of these subjects, the government would find it very difficult to carry on its business amicably for any length of time. In fact, for the C.M.S. to withdraw their support from N.Z. at the present time would be to undo all that has been done, that is, as respects the present generation.  Some, thanks God, have been taken away in peace, nothing can affect them!  I am writing in a hurry this evening so I must beg you to excuse the bad writing, I hope you will manage to read it.  I am anxiously expecting to hear of you - whether you are improving in health.  As this will, I trust, reach you with the letter to my mother, I shall say no more than that I desire again my love to all.</p>
      <p>Believe me, My dear George,</p>
      <p>Your very affectionate brother,</p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>Octavius Hadfield.</p>
