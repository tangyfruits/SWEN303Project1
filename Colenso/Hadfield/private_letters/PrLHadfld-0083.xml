      <p>Wellington - July 19., 1854.</p>
      <p>My dear Maria,</p>
      <p>I have lately been deferring to write until I should hear again from home, but as I hear a vessel is sailing for Sydney I must write again a few lines.  I think I have already acknowledged the receipt of your kind letter of, I think, November.  Kate received my dear Mother's letter of Dec. today.  She tells me to send her best thanks, &amp; to say that she will write again soon.  We have English papers &amp; letters up to Ap. 3rd. &amp; I cannot make out why I have nothing later than Dec. from any of you.  The accounts we have had of the coldness of the winter makes me anxious to hear.  I should also like to know how the war movements affect Charles.  I must, I suppose, wait patiently for some fresh arrivals.  I do not at all like the war.  I see no prospect of a speedy termination.  I have so little confidence in Austria &amp; Prussia that I fully expect to hear shortly that they are engaged on the side of Russia.  We must however, look upwards to One who guides all human affairs &amp; Who will bring good out of evil.</p>
      <p>We are in an unsettled state here.  Our young politicians are trying their hands at the new constitution; &amp; it is not easy to see what the result may be.</p>
      <p>Church matters are as usual, only making slow progress.  We do not like the prospect of losing our Bishop, which, from information I have received from the Col. Office, I take for granted we shall.  </p>
      <p>We have lately been visited with the measles, which has been very severe, &amp; which has occasioned much suffering &amp; many deaths.</p>
      <p>The natives were ill by hundreds at a time.  Our medical man at Otaki was of great service, and the deaths there hitherto have been very few, but at some other places there have been many deaths.  In my ride hither a few weeks ago, I went out of my way on hearing of the measles at <supplied>[a]</supplied> place in the neighbourhood &amp; I found the whole population of the village laid low: there had been eight deaths, &amp; those who were suffering were unable to supply their necessary wants.  In some houses they were all ill;- there were none to fetch water or to light a fire.  There was a corpse to be buried, &amp; had not I two natives who were accidentally with me carried it to the grave it must have remained for the dogs to feed on.  I never saw such misery in my life.  All this happened within 14 miles of Wellington.  I immediately sent up food &amp; applied for &amp; obtained a medial man's assistance.  In Europe, when children get these complaints we have no notion of the wretchedness occasioned by an epidemic of this kind attacking old &amp; young &amp; prostrating all before it.  I had been for many weeks attending measles patients, especially our school boys who were all laid up with it, &amp; Samuel Williams who suffered very severely, so that I was not surprised to be laid up with it myself.  I was taken ill with it here, &amp; had my old nurse Mrs. St.Hill to attend to me, &amp; my old Doctor, Fitzgerald, (who by the by is now going home &amp; will try and pay you a visit).  I suffered from a severe attack, but am now quite well again.  Kate &amp; our little boy were laid up at the same time at Otaki.  They recovered sooner than I did, &amp; then came in here at Mrs. St.Hill's request to look after me.  We are purposing to return tomorrow to Otaki.  I have been unfit for any work for nearly three weeks, &amp; there is much to be done.  But we cannot be too often taught how little our Heavenly Father has need of our services- how easily they can be dispensed with!  I have now a great many matters to attend to.  I do not dislike work, &amp; I think the more one has to do, the better one gets thro' it; but there are many little trivial matters to which one is obliged to put a great deal of time &amp; attention, which tire me out.  Mr. &amp; Miss. St.Hill are here with Mrs. St. Hill.  My old friend St.Hill is attending the Legislative Council at Auckland.  He has been absent two months.  We expect him back in about another month.  I am now working in a room full of people some of whom are talking to me, so if my thoughts have not been very connected you must excuse me.  I shall hope to hear soon of you all, &amp; I shall be happy to have a good report of you.  Kate sends her affectionate love; in this of course I heartily join.  Give my especial love to our dear Mother,</p>
      <p>From your very affectionate brother,
      </p>
      <p>Octavius Hadfield.</p>
