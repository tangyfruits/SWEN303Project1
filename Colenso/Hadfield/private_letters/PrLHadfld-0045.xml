      <p>My dear Mother,</p>
      <p>I have a few minutes to write in &amp; as I hear there is a vessel going direct to England, I gladly employ them in writing to you.  I have been much gratified since I last wrote, which was to Henry, by receiving several letters from hom: from Amelia, my father, Octavia, &amp; George.  Receiving them all at one time, you were all brought very forcibly before my mind; &amp; I received great delight from it.  I also received a letter from Alick.  You appeared all to be tolerably well when those letters were written &amp; I trust this will find you so.  I have to thank I believe George for news-papers, which are interesting.  I was rather unwell when I last wrote: &amp; have been worse since; but am now well again.  I cannot do so much work now as I used some time ago: but I am not quite left to myself now: though my fellow-workers know but little of the language of the natives.</p>
      <p>The natives are going on quietly &amp; steadily; &amp; I lately was joined by almost all the remnant of the heathen party, at Otaki &amp; the neighbourhood.  These people have resisted me in every possible way during nearly four years: &amp; now they openly confess that their object in doing so was to induce me to leave them in disgust; but that having watched us, the christian party, during so long a period, they are compelled to acknowledge, that we are in possession of some principles, whose tendencies are more conducive to order &amp; good conduct - they our enemies being our judges - than any with which they were acquainted.  The people at Waikanae have built a very beautiful church, which is now almost complete; &amp; which is much admired.  They have been engaged nearly two years at it, &amp; have worked well &amp; altogether gratuitously.  </p>
      <p>I am now going to build myself a house at Waikanae, as my old mud-house is decaying fast &amp; excessively damp, &amp; the cause of hindering my work, as it is not fit for a European residence.  I have been careful not to spend more of the Society's money than is necessary; but I find a man gets no credit for it, &amp; that if one does not take care of oneself, there is nobody here to take care of one.  Many who have come much since I have &amp; have never done any work, are living in good houses.  Economy may be carried too far, &amp; some of my medical friends here tell me that I shall soon be able to do no work at all if I do not take care of myself.  I merely mention this, because whilst I have been protesting against the extravagance of this mission I may be accused of taking care of myself as well as others taking care of themselves.</p>
      <p>My friends here are very kind; &amp; nobody could be more constantly kind &amp; attentive than my dear friends the St Hills, with whom I am now for a day or two, having money matters to attend to here.  I return to-day to Waikanae, &amp; as I must go about twenty miles, I must put an end to my writing.  Give my kindest love to all at home &amp; kindest regards to all friends &amp; </p>
      <p>Believe me my dear Mother</p>
      <p>Ever most affectionately yours,
      </p>
      <p>Octavius Hadfield.</p>
