      <p>Port Nicholson,</p>
      <p>New Zealand.</p>
      <p>March 8. 1843</p>
      <p>My dear Father</p>
      <p>I lately received at letter from Julia (dated Sep. 28th.) in which she sends me a message from you to desire me to write when I have an opportunity; having now a few minutes to write in I do so, as there is a vessel going almost immediately - I was happy to hear that you were pretty well at the time of Julia's writing.  It gives me great pleasure to hear from &amp; about you all, but your letters do not reach me very regularly.  I wrote a long letter to Caroline about 4 or 6 weeks ago, in which I mentioned my poor friend Mason's death &amp; my narrow escape which you I trust will have received before this reaches you.  I have lately had a pleasant visit to Queen Charlotte's Sound &amp; I find the natives there as attentive as ever &amp; as desirous of receiving instruction.  They seem to care for little else than religion &amp; are regardless of worldly concerns to their own detriment in some measure; but as they are following the scriptural command of "seeking first the Kingdom of God &amp; His righteousness" I trust that they will have the blessing of God upon their temporal concerns, &amp; that they may be preserved amidst the dangers to which they are exposed by the habits etc. of our countrymen. </p>
      <p>I have now more to do than ever since Mason's death; but my strength I think is as great as it ever is, &amp; I am quite well.  I am come over over here for two days, on some matters of business &amp; then return.  Things are rather in a dull state in this place.  I am with some others making some exertions to get the natives to work at the N.Z. Flax, which will be much for their benefit &amp; it is almost essential to the welfare of this colony that they should have some export.  They have always been trying to invent some machine for the preparation of the flax, but I think that I have convinced some that the natives could immediately prepare sufficient to form an annual export of &#163;200,000 which would be an immediate benefit to this country.  You need not however think that I employ any time in these matters: they are merely facts which force themselves upon the observation of those who go about with their eyes open which all here do not. </p>
      <p>I shall hear again shortly from you, <!--previous editor's note: [torn out]--> disappointed very often on the arrival of ships. </p>
      <p>Give my kindest regards to the Warrens &amp; all our friends, especially the <supplied>[Ivins]</supplied> if you write - &amp; my affectionate love to my mother &amp; brothers &amp; sisters.</p>
      <p>Ever your affectionate son,
      </p>
      <p>Octavius Hadfield.</p>
