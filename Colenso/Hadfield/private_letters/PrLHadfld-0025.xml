      <p>Kapiti,</p>
      <p>New Zealand</p>
      <p>Dec. 19th. 1839</p>
      <p>My dear Charles,</p>
      <p>I received your acceptable letter dated Portsmouth, May 6th, on the 8th. inst.  It is the only letter I have received since Octavia's of Jan.  By the postmark your letter was in Sep. 1.  My letters must be delayed by some means unknown; I must make enquiries, for your letter evidently intimates that letters have been written to me.  Henceforth be so good as to direct, <hi rend="underline">Kapiti</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Cook's Strait</hi>, N.Z.  I was indeed happy to learn that all were tolerably well at home, &amp; especially my dear father &amp; mother.  Octavia, I fear, has not been enjoying good health &amp; George still not very strong.  I am somewhat glad Henry has returned to England, tho' I at the same time regret that France did not agree with his health.  As you are not fond of the sea your embarkation on board the <hi rend="underline">Britannia</hi> is certainly in your favor.  You speak of your walk a few days previous to your letter's date thro' Bonchurch &amp; mention that many of our old haunts recalled me to your mind, &amp; speak also of the uncertainty of the time when we may meet again.  I often think of old times, &amp; often of the last evening I passed with you at Ventnor.  Situated as I at present am, I have no prospect of returning, yet we know not what a day may bring forth.  You speak also, I rejoice to say, of the vanity &amp; unsatisfactory nature of earthly things, &amp; your desire to rest only on the Lord Jesus Christ &amp; find all your happiness in him.  Oh, may we both feel this more &amp; more, day by day, &amp; hereafter meet to walk together in glorified bodies in the presence of Our God, &amp; of the Lamb, our adorable &amp; everblessed Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ.  </p>
      <p>The last letter I wrote was from the Bay of Islands in October to dear George, stating that I had altogether left the school and was about to sail to Kapiti, or Entry Island, in Cook Strait.</p>
      <p>I landed first in Port Nicholson on the 8th of November accompanied by the Rev. H. Williams, who remained with me three weeks. I then went across to Cloudy Bay in the Middle Island &amp; remained a day or two. There are several parties of English men about that &amp; this part, engaged in catching whales.  I distributed some book among these &amp; also visited the few natives in those parts.  We left Cloudy Bay, but as the wind headed us we went again into Port Nicholson where Mr. W. &amp; I determined to walk to the coast opposite Kapiti. The first day we went about 15 miles thro' a thick hilly forest, we were accompanied by about 20 natives.  We stopped at two or three native villages &amp; also went to the Island of Mana.  The natives everywhere received us with the greatest kindness &amp; listened with great attention to the Gospel of the Saviour.  The last days walk we went along the beach, passing several native villages form all of which the natives came out to welcome us, &amp; after about 15 miles of hard walking we arrived at the large pa or village in which I am now residing.  The people on our arrival were in a state of warfare. The people of the Pa were attacked about 5 weeks before suddenly in the night by the natives of Otaki, a Pa about 11 miles further on the coast. There were about 35 of the latter killed, &amp; 20 of the former. They were obliged to return leaving everything that they had with them. The people of this place have been slightly instructed in the truths of the Gospel by a native who came down a few years ago from Paihia, one of our settlements. They only acted on the defensive &amp; contrary to precedent &amp; native custom, instead of eating the dead bodies, buried them with all the spoil. Peace has now been established among them by Mr. W's influence &amp; persuasion &amp; I must now endeavour to maintain it, tho' the Otaki natives are by no means very much inclined to peace. But to return, on my first arrival I was very much interested in seeing about 800 or 900 natives immediately assemble for prayers, after which Mr. W. addressed them, when the greatest attention was manifested.  The diligence these poor creatures have used is quite astonishing in acquiring knowledge they have thro' the instrumentality of the man I before mentioned, Matapau, now baptised Joseph.  Many of them learnt to read &amp; write a little, &amp; have copied out the morn &amp; even prayers, having only one or two books.</p>
      <p>The Island of Kapiti at which ships are accustomed to anchor lies about 4 or 5 miles from the coast where I am now living, which is called Waikanae. I am at present, contrary to the preceding custom of all the missionaries, living in the Pa or fortified village. I have now been six weeks in a small tent 7 feet square, moving about, but during the last week I have settled here. A tent is not very comfortable as it is cold at night &amp; warm in the day time. It is now while I am writing very hot; the natives also <supplied>[all]</supplied> crowding about &amp; putting their heads in at all times. I am having a house built of rushes by natives in the Pa. I brought a few blankets with me &amp; some bricks to make a chimney before winter comes as it is rather cold in this part of N.Z. There are many disadvantages in living in a native Pa, for many reasons, &amp; one is the excessive filth and also noise of the natives, indeed it would be impossible for a family to do so, but they are all such as concern one's own comfort.  On the other hand, in a missionary point of view, to my mind whatever the married men here say, it appears evidently preferable as one has the natives ever under one's eye, &amp; one is always at hand to attend to schools etc.  Personal inconvenience is nothing to me.  I can safely say that I did not, as some have, come to seek worldly comfort but to spend myself in the service &amp; for the glory of the Lord Jesus.  No missionary has either hitherto gone alone to any station, but I am living 300 miles from any other missionary. But tho' I am labouring under many disadvantages, &amp; one great one, an almost entire ignorance of the language (tho' I have learnt more the last few weeks than I did all the time before) I never felt happier and more contented &amp; composed in my life, or ready to endure &amp; bear whatever the Lord may call me to.  I fear I am beginning to speak too much of myself, but the truth I cannot for the life of me understand wherever all the privations &amp; trials that the missionaries here talk &amp; write of really are, &amp; whence arises their aversion to move among the heathen for the furtherance of that work in which they have engaged &amp; for which they are paid.  "Oh, may the Lord pour out His spirit upon us in this Land".</p>
      <p>You might see by referring to our annual Report the average number of natives generally attending schools.  I only began my school in this Pa the other day, &amp; had this morning present 180 males &amp; 48 females, adults, &amp; should have more but I have not at present slates &amp; books or teachers enough.  I have three Christian natives, one of <supplied>[whom]</supplied> I brought from Waimate, who attends on me for everything; &amp; there are daily present morn &amp; even for prayers about 500.  I long to be able to speak properly, &amp; trust that I soon shall.  </p>
      <p>I had, previous to my arrival here, a strong desire to go to Turanga where Mr. W. Williams is gone, but the Lord opened me a door here &amp; I now would not willingly change it for any place in the world.  I am also going to have a small house built for me at Otaki, about 11 miles to the north on the coast.  The natives there are numerous, &amp; I shall reside for a week or two at a time at each place, &amp; thus endeavour to keep the peace between them, &amp; lead their minds to think of peace with God, &amp; to Him, by Whom peace is made with God.  This is not a very promising place, but I rode over there the day before yesterday &amp; carried some books to the chief &amp; his sons, &amp; they spoke very well.  Stories fly about fast here, &amp; they heard that I was dead, &amp; I was greatly surprised to see how they, men women &amp; children ran out with smiling faces to welcome me.  This chief is only just coming round, having been influenced hitherto by a very bad fellow, Rauparaha, who in hopes of obtaining a few blankets is making a profession.  The chiefs, however, of the Pa in which I now am are exceeding desirous of instruction and are very kind to me. I am quite amused in the morning to see the principal chief of the place, Reretauwangawanga, learning to read &amp; write his letters. He is an old man with a long grey beard.  I think I am writing in better spirits than I have hitherto done.  I do not know whether you have seen any of my letters but I was, (I must say) so disgusted with Waimate &amp; all (not every person) in it that, I fear, I must have written in a gloomy manner.  I am sorry however, to be obliged to say that my health is by no means good.  It was much impaired while I was in the school.  I suffer much from disordered bowels &amp; also from asthma.  I was lately while at Otaki in my tent attacked with severe diarrhoea which confined me to my bed for several days.  This was accompanied also with asthma so that I could not lie down.  The only medicine I had with me was Rhubarb &amp; laudanum.  I took some of the former &amp; about 400 or 500 drops of the latter every day for about 10 days.  I had only ship biscuit &amp; flour; nevertheless the Lord raised me up.  My things have now all arrived &amp; I have plenty of food and medicine.  This morn a surgeon who happened to be in the neighbourhood called, having heard that I was ill, but I am now well.  The Lord, I am persuaded, will supply all my need &amp; hereafter bring me to His own eternal presence in glory.  Oh, the riches of divine grace &amp; the abundance of Jehovah's love!  <hi rend="underline">Write often.</hi>  I have such abundance of occupation &amp; meet with so much interruption from natives that you must excuse hasty scrawls.  I now write by way of America.  I do not know when you may receive it.  Remember me, I pray, to all dear friends, &amp; give my love to my Father &amp; Mother &amp; all my dear brothers &amp; sisters when you either see or write to them.  </p>
      <p>Believe me, my dear Charles, </p>
      <p>Ever your sincerely attached &amp; affectionate brother,</p>
      
      <p>Octavius Hadfield.</p>
      <p>There are a great many natives about 40 miles on the coast at Wanganui whom I must soon endeavour to visit.</p>
      <p>O.H.</p>
