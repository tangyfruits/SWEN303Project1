      <p>Saturday</p>
      <p>February 8th. 1838</p>
      <p>My dear Octavia,</p>
      <p>I am in a great hurry.  I have just got a notice that I must be on board in two hours.  I shall sleep on board as the ship goes out of dock before day light in the morning.  If we have a fair wind we shall be out of the channel now in a few days.  I have nothing to say.  I am quite well and have put everything on board.  I had wished to have written more fully to you but I cannot.  May the Lord be with you all.  Give my love to my father and mother and all and believe me</p>
      <p>Ever your affectionate brother</p>
      <p>Octavius Hadfield.</p>
      <p>London</p>
      <p>I write a few lines to George - farewell.
      </p>
