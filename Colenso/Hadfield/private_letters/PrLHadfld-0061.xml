      <p>Wellington March 6 1847</p>
      <p>My dear Mother,</p>
      <p>Some time ago I had the great pleasure of receiving your very kind letter of July.  I have not hitherto had a good opportunity of sending an answer: one now offers by way of Valparaiso, &amp; I shall therefore write a hurried line.  A few days since, I received two letters, dated September, one from Charles, the other from Henry.  Be so good to thank them for their letters: I hope to do so myself soon.  The accounts I have of you by these letters are as good as I can expect.  Though absent from you, you are all frequently in my mind, &amp; time &amp; distance seem, in imagination, to disappear.  God has been very gracious to us all:- when I think of the various foolish differences that sometimes distract families, I feel very thankful that we at least have been united in love.</p>
      <p>Neither Charles nor Henry seem to enjoy very robust health: their health may however, improve yet, with care.  I was very much pleased to hear that George had obtained such employment as is suitable to his wishes; but should have liked to have heard rather more of particulars than H.'s &amp; C.'s letters convey: indeed I do not know much of the nature of the College, I believe it is for educating missionaries; if so I must indeed think that George is likely to be very useful in such a position.  I firmly believe that a great inroad has already been made into the regions of heathenism, &amp; another generation may require more efficient missionaries than will, without care be obtained.  It is true that not much yet has been done, but the beginning is the chief thing: a host of difficulties have already vanished away, &amp; perhaps the greatest of all,- the objections &amp; prejudices of nominal christians; they begin to see that some good, good which even they can appreciate, has been done: - but when the scattered sparks which already - though few in number,- begin to give out a little light, how quickly may the light extend, &amp; the glorious Gospel be understood by millions.  Hitherto, almost all has been done by foreigners, but when natives shall begin to communicate to men, to their own friends &amp; countrymen,- in their own idiom as well as language, the truths which they feel have warmed their own souls, how rapidly may not the Gospel extend!  Oh, for more faith, more prayers!  But I must stop &amp; give you a few words about myself.  My health continues much as it was.  I pass my time in bed, rising, however, most days, for one hour, or two, to lie upon the sofa, or to walk a few minutes in the garden.  I read a great deal, though it fatigues me, writing I find more irksome than I did: the least excitement or exertion, either of mind or body, excites the heart, increases its action, &amp; gives me pain; but what I suffer is, by the mercy of God, very bearable.  I feel that my life is very precarious; I would wish to keep my thoughts fixed on Heaven alone, but as long as we are in the world, we seem bound to give some attention to worldly matters, especially if by doing so we can still assist &amp; benefit our fellow-creatures.  Mr. &amp; Mrs. StHill are as kind as ever,- indeed their kindness could not be surpassed by anybody, perhaps not equalled.  I feel deeply indebted to them, but kindness seems to have entered more into their composition than it generally does with human beings. </p>
      <p>I heard lately from Mr. Venn, he wishes me to give them all the information I can about matters here, so I shall write very fully shortly as I think I can give them some valuable information about the general state of the N.Z. church.  Few here have the time to consider the whole question deeply.  I am going to call their attention to the subject of ecclesiastical law in the <hi rend="underline">Colonies</hi> - an important subject, in order than their operations may not be crippled.  Our governor is very civil to me: he has taken my advice on several very important questions, he left us last week, but will return directly.  I shall hope to write again shortly.  Pray give my kindest &amp; most affectionate love to my Father, &amp; all at home &amp; absent. &amp; Believe me my dearest Mother,</p>
      <p>Your very affectionate son
      </p>
      <p>Octavius Hadfield.</p>
