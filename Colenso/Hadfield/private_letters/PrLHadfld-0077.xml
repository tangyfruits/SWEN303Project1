      <p>Otaki, 6th. May 50.</p>
      <p>My dear George,</p>
      <p>I have not yet thanked you for your letter of Sept. 1 last., tho' I acknowledged its receipt in a letter to Amelia written from Wellington a few days ago.  Another ship is now sailing &amp; so I write again.  I have this day received a letter from Octavia dated Oct. 29th. by which I am happy to hear that you are all tolerably well.  I very much regret that you are obliged to reside in England as the climate does not seem to suit you so well as many places abroad.  This climate I am tolerably sure would agree with you, but then I do not feel quite certain you would like to be here.  My health is wonderfully good considering what I have gone through &amp; I am still able to get on with a fair amount of work of one kind or another.  Any intellectual work that absorbs my thoughts &amp; interests me much disorders my nervous system &amp; I become unwell; but a little relaxation restores me.  I have no great occasion, however, in a general way for this, still now &amp; then it comes upon me.  Even today I have received a long and interesting letter from Sir G. Grey asking my my advice &amp; assistance in forming a Church constitution for N.Z. which it is intended we should well consider, I then having obtained the Bishop's assent to it, endeavour to have it adopted by all Churchmen throughout the Islands, in order that Church government may be something more than it is at home, &amp; that we may be able to work more effectually upon the surrounding heathen nations.  There are many difficulties attending the subject, chiefly from our being unable to ascertain with precision what is the nature of our connection with the Church at home in reference to Church government.  For instance the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts (as laid down by Blackstone) does not extend to the Colonies; but then all that part of the Ecclesiastical Law connected with the Common-law Courts does.  We have many restrictions &amp; disadvantages from this latter consideration &amp; not one advantage: we are in the same position as Dissenters as to assistance from the State, but in a far worse one inasmuch as the Common-law affects us in many respects to our disadvantage.  Sir G. Grey is of course acting in this matter as a private individual.  I have not seen him for more than a year; but we have frequently discussed these subjects when I had more leisure for thought than at present.  I fear that he expects more from me than he will obtain.  My strength, if I have any, consists in detecting errors in other persons' plans, not in originating one of my own.  I must however, try to concentrate my scattered thoughts on this subject &amp; lend a helping hand,- to use Sir G. Grey's words- "to assist in founding here an efficient Church, which may with God's blessing promote His service, spread a knowledge of the Gospel &amp; secure the future welfare of those vast numbers of our brethren who will hereafter occupy these Islands."</p>
      <p>N.Z. is not at present important in itself, but it is impossible to consider its climate, its position on the Globe, the ease with which it is destined to be peopled, &amp; the good beginning already made, without feeling convinced that here especially (though it is in truth the same in every place) every act must be productive of good or evil to the generations to come.  What a wretched foundation has been laid for future natives in the neighbouring penal colonies.  Here matters are promising.  May we all in this land bear this in mind.</p>
      <p>I do not see much of newspapers, but manage to keep up a tolerably connected outline of what is going on in Europe.  You say Tractarianism is not so much talked of as it was.  I should think it could only take with a peculiar class of mind.  There seems an inconsistency in the system, &amp; want of honesty in the persons who advocate it which could hardly allow it to spread except with those who do not think deeply.  But what form of error will not find advocates, &amp; even talented ones!  I have seen little or nothing of what has been said of the Inspiration of the Scriptures, what I have seen in the "Record", in occasional articles I do not think very profound.  I do not know what has been said, or what precise opinion you allude to; but I confess candidly that I do not think the old notion- that defended by Horne in his "introduction to the Scriptures", &amp; by other writers of the same stamp, is defensible on sound principles; &amp; moreover I think it leads to many difficulties.  The Jews unquestionably did not attributge the same degree (perhaps not the same kind) of Inspiration to the Pentateuch, the Hagio-graphia, &amp; the Prophets.  Let any man attempt to define in accurate philosophical language what idea he attaches to the rerm "inspiration" &amp; he will at once find the difficulty of the whole question; or if he does not, let him apply his own definition to the solution of several difficulties which may be suggested &amp; he will soon discover that the question is no easy one.  I do not suppose that the whole subject has not been deeply considered by you.  But I look almost in vain for anything profound &amp; accurate in thought among the writings of the theologians of the present day.  I find more to satisfy me in Whately, Hinds &amp; Hare than in most modern men.  Coleridge's writings are the deepest, by far the deepest of any I have read; but there are some strange things in his writings which would offend many; nor would any enter into his writings without a metaphysical turn of mind, which, tho' it has not been much developed in me, I have.  His letters on "Inspiration" I in great measure agree with; but I would hardly venture to recommend them, unless to one who understood &amp; entered into his system of philosophy, or he would probably get more harm than good from them.  I agree with those who think that theology &amp; religion are very different things.  When good men attempt to give accurate definitions of spiritual matters they frequently talk much nonsense, &amp; I think much nonsense has been taught concerning the inspiration of the H.S.- Many objectionable things may have been written on the subject which I have not yet seen or heard of.  </p>
      <p>Pray write to me when you can find time.  I hope to be usefully employed in training &amp; instructing teachers for the neighbouring villages.  I trust I shall have strength for this.  I had three services &amp; preached twice the two last Sundays.  May our Heavenly Father bless &amp; prosper you all.</p>
      <p>With love to all, etc.
      </p>
      <p>Octavius Hadfield.</p>
