         <p rend="end">Gow’s Hotel, <lb/>Waipukurau. <lb/>Decr. 31/79.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Thanks be to <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> for bringing you &amp; yours once a more in safety over the Ocean!—and a very Happy New Year to (all), may it prove to be your best.—</p>
         <p>Last evening—late—while outside talking with H.R.R.—the postmaster came up bringing Grubb’s envelope enclosing your telegram from “Albion,” Bluff. I had begun to be a wee bit fidgetty about you—the “Sabraon” being such a good ship, &amp; no telegram from Melbe. <hi rend="italic">re</hi> her arrival there, &amp; so I wrote to our friend Grubb 2 days ago, for I had taken care, before I left town, to leave a note with Officer in Chge. Tel. Dept. <hi rend="italic">re</hi> all telegrams for me to be sent to Grubb.—</p>
         <p>As the overland M. (now 3ce a week) leaves here tomorrow mg., I write a line to go by it, &amp; so be among the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of Napier to welcome you—at Wellington—to your old Cy. the <hi rend="italic">N. Island</hi>. No doubt <hi rend="italic">there</hi> you will go in for glancing over a pile of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> papers—which will give you principal news.—</p>
         <p>Tylee &amp; son left last week for England, <hi rend="italic">hence</hi> per “Waimea”. Irvine has just resigned his G. School, &amp; is off for Australia, where he has secured a “living”. Here, &amp; generally in N.Z. (save Southland) we have had rather too much wet this summer for the Cereals—the consequence is a large amount of Rust in the Wheat &amp;c.,—J.N. Williams’ is to be wholly burnt! &amp; H.R.R. told me yesterday, his would also be destroyed—but, from examination (myself) I hope not,—perhaps a ½ crop, or so,—as the weather is now, <hi rend="italic">at last</hi>, settled in <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>—beginning on Sunday last. I went to the “40 m. Bush” 12 days back, intending to return quickly! but the continued rain prevented me.—Mrs. Hardy is dead (schoolmaster’s wife), so is Bullen—a Market-Gardener at Papakura—killed in falling from his cart near “Shamrock”: of Giffard’s death I must I think have written you. <hi rend="italic">Young</hi> (<hi rend="italic">H.</hi>) Lascelles is married to Sam. Davis’ daughter. Have heard <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of the Dolbels for 2 months. Have not yet had any English (&amp; other) letters which arrived at Napier on 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>., for, as I had purposed returning thither <hi rend="italic">early</hi>, I had left word for them to be retained for me: I intend going back tonight. The weather now is very hot—a few days ago it was cold! &amp; fires in esteem! I do hope that things <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> are looking better—but this hideous &amp; heavy <hi rend="italic">property tax</hi> will do immense mischief to the Colony.—</p>
         <p>I shall hope soon to have a line from you, &amp; once more to see your own well-known &amp; ever-welcome hand-writing. Great bustle <hi rend="italic">here</hi> just now, owing to Xmas sports &amp;c. Please excuse this written in the Common Room, with many flies &amp; bother!! and with kindest regards &amp; best wishes, believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
