         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I write a few lines to go to you by your weekly mail tomorrow, to remind you of your “Divot” plants.</p>
         <p>Ours have flowered (Hamiltons, at Petane, &amp; mine here) a fortnight back, &amp; though yours may be later, they won’t be long behind. I know you are busy. P.D. told me so on Monday night,—also that you were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> at the show. I made sure that you were there, or I should have written last week; and I was <hi rend="italic">pleased</hi> that <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sheep (Kinross) had gained <hi rend="italic">prizes</hi>; but now I find they came from Raukawa. I hope you are all well, Mrs Balfour, your little son, and all yours at Glenross.</p>
         <p>I have been hard at work among our wee little plants.</p>
         <p>I suppose you saw in “D.T.” notice of our last meeting, and of your ex­hibits—which covered the table.</p>
         <p>Also the fine (?) “Skit” upon us, or rather me in the “Herald”. I hope none of our members will take offence at such <hi rend="italic">low</hi> scribbling; <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">shall</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">not</hi>.<note xml:id="ftn3-203" place="foot" n="203"> The Knife-Grinders’ Society. </note>
         </p>
         <p>With kind regards to all of your Clan. I am </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>(in haste)</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
