         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Hawkes Bay<lb/>N.Z., March 4/52</p>
         <p>Messrs. Dixon &amp; Co.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs</p>
         <p>I last wrote to you on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Jany.—a copy of wh. Letter &amp; order I now enclose, together with the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> of a Sett of Bills of Ex. for ₤38.6.6—the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> having been forwarded in that Letter.—</p>
         <p>Last week the goods (8 packages) shipped by you per “<hi rend="italic">Maori</hi>” arrived here, together with 2 Letters or rather Invoice &amp; Duplicate (1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. &amp; 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Sepr./51), &amp; 2 Papers. The goods were in good condition (save the doz. moleskin Trowsers), but, <hi rend="underline italic">as usual</hi>, incomplete, &amp; some <hi rend="italic">not</hi> according to order.—</p>
         <p>First—things ordered, but <hi rend="underline italic">not sent</hi>:—</p>
         <p>1lb. spirits Hartshorn</p>
         <p>1 packet Broad’s perfume &amp;c</p>
         <p>2 lbs chalk</p>
         <p>2 prs cork <hi rend="italic">soles</hi>, straights, self.</p>
         <p>5 Fur Tippetts</p>
         <p>1 pr Gutta percha Boots</p>
         <p>1 London Pharmacopæa, <hi rend="italic">last</hi> ed.</p>
         <p>1 <hi rend="italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">nd</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">.</hi> vol. of H. Brit. Flora—last ed.</p>
         <p>1 Fries Lichenog. Univ. <hi rend="italic">or </hi>— —</p>
         <p>1 McBrides Lectures on D.—<hi rend="italic">last ed.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>1 rm <hi rend="italic">yellow </hi>Letter paper</p>
         <p>1 gr. wicks, for my little study Lamp, fine cotton, <hi rend="sup">15</hi>/<hi rend="sub">16 </hi>in. diam.</p>
         <p>&amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>—things <hi rend="italic">sent</hi>, but <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi> ordered</p>
         <p>2 pair Boots lined with cork</p>
         <p>1 ————  ———— g. percha</p>
         <p>5 little Boas!</p>
         <p>1 ream <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> Letter paper</p>
         <p>1 gross <hi rend="underline italic">solar</hi> Lamp wicks—large &amp; coarse</p>
         <p>It is true, you briefly state (in reference to the Books) “the works omitted are either reprinting or not to be had”—but this statement, allow me to say (&amp; I would do so in the most courteous manner,) is far too general. 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. Bec. the very papers of the day advertise some of those very works—&amp; 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. from the very fact of their being standard ones, they must be either always on sale, <hi rend="italic">or </hi>very speedily re-published.</p>
         <p>I am, in all my little orders, to write both perspicaciously &amp; in a plain hand. I am not aware of my having generally written for articles wh. can give an agent extra trouble; or, if so, that I should refuse or hesitate to pay for so doing. But, it does seem as if every order I send is sure <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be fulfilled, and my enquiries not worthy your notice.</p>
         <p>In my Letter of Apl./50, I made several enquiries—respecting Musical Boxes, Iron pots—Felt Carpetting—Book-bags (n.—100), &amp;c.,—&amp; a particular commission respecting Mr. Berdoe, &amp;c &amp;c—all of wh. have been passed unnoticed by.—</p>
         <p>In my Letter of Sept/50—I also requested to know the qualities &amp; uses of the “suspension stove,” and the price of gutta percha tubing; <hi rend="italic">also</hi>, to have <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> the Books ordered sent—but, my enquiries have not been noticed, &amp; request not attended to.—</p>
         <p>The Book wh. came (you say) from a Bookseller at the w. end, &amp; wh. you suppd. to be from Sir W.J.H., &amp; perhaps one of those ordered—proved to be a vol. of Alford’s Grk. Test. from my Cousin.—</p>
         <p>In all <hi rend="italic">such</hi> suppository cases you had better open the parcel &amp; ascertain.</p>
         <p>All that have not been sent—throughout the last 3 or 4 orders—you can still send; but what shall I say with reference to these 5 “<hi rend="italic">Boas</hi>”!! These are utterly useless to us; they have also cost upwards of ₤5.0.0. I think <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should request them to be returned, or to be sent to Wellgn. &amp; there disposed of on your account. Had a Cornish tradesman made such a blunder, what a chuckling triumph it wod. have been for you Londoners! You must allow this remark, when you consider that this error is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the first of its kind, &amp; that <hi rend="underline italic">we are the sufferers in every sense</hi>. I cannot tell you how very greatly the Ladies for whom they were ordered are disappointed.</p>
         <p>There is also a little error in your Seedsman’s Bill—he charges for “<hi rend="italic">12 extra S. Ranunculus 2/6</hi>” but there is not one—nor the shadow of one in the lot. I have thrice gone over every packet of seeds.</p>
         <p>I can easily understand why there should be in every order an error in judgment—on both sides—but I cannot comprehend why a thing ordered in a plain way is not sent—or, why a simple business question asked is not simply ansd.—I must not howr. omit to thank you for the Copy of Cook’s Voyages, it is in excellent condition, &amp; appears to be perfect; this is quite an acquisition. Would that the other Books had come with it.—</p>
         <p>In my last orders,—2 of which are still to come,—<hi rend="italic">I numbered every lot</hi>—This I did, for your sake, &amp; I have to beg that in your future invoices do the same, &amp; so, <hi rend="italic">either send</hi> every lot as ordered or give me your remark thereon under its no.</p>
         <p>We have sometimes conjectured that it is, perhaps, owing to my not having sent you enough money with my order—that certain articles ordered from time to time have not been sent; I therefore now enclose the first of a Sett of Bills on CMS. for F. P— (₤50) which, with (₤150.19.0, &amp; ₤38.6.6 =) ₤189.5.6, already sent in my 2 last Letters, will I hope fully enable you to do so.—</p>
         <p>I do not now care to send you any additional order, (although there are several things which we should like to have,)—save</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>a plain Blue Cloth cloak with fur collar for myself—price, under ₤3.3.0; the fur to be of <hi rend="italic">dark</hi> color.—</item>
            <item>an extra fur Collar for ditto (as the fur soon becomes shabby).</item>
            <item>a large fine Blanket shawl—chequered; for my own use in the Bush. The Bishop has one, wh. he finds to be of more service than a cloak.</item>
            <item>a Black cap for myself (size 7¼)—a useful, light, ventilating, &amp; not unbecoming article;—or, you may send 2—each of difft. pattern &amp;c</item>
            <item>a Black Hat for myself—size 7¼—not above 20/- —light, soft, &amp;c</item>
            <item>a palisse of scarlet pelisse cloth trimmed with fur, for a little boy of 2 (say 3) years of age, to be made loose.</item>
            <item>4 doz. youths’ striped stoutest cotton shirts—</item>
            <item>12 pounds Best Tapioca—</item>
            <item>2 Tinplate candle moulds, size 6’s.—8, or so in a mould.</item>
            <item>a map, or sett of maps, of stars of the <hi rend="doubleunderline underline italic">Southern</hi>
               <hi rend="underline"> </hi>Hemisphere, and Mrs Colenso wishes to know the price of a <hi rend="underline italic">small</hi>
               <hi rend="italic">still</hi>: complete, for Herbs.</item>
         </list>
         <p>I will, however, venture to request you again to send me in addition those things herein enumerated as being omitted,—excluding the Fur Tippetts &amp; Boots; which I had marked x. Also, send me <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> Books not hitherto sent.</p>
         <p>There is another little matter to which I wish to draw yr. attention—namely, that made up wearing apparel (as well as prints, &amp;c, &amp;c,) sold at Wellington &amp; other places are made purposely for the N.Z. market. All their shirts—of various kinds—are wider &amp; longer than yours (though not so good, or so well made),—Trowsers large &amp; comfortable in the seat, &amp; small in the legs—whereas yours are just the contrary; &amp; then as to color, &amp;c. Pray my dear Sirs, bear this in mind, as you have a large order altogether now to execute, &amp; I have several things lying-by of little use <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. Be very sure that you never again send me any of those Trowsers which open <hi rend="italic">down the front</hi>—we actually abominate them; &amp; oppose their being used by our Natives as much as possible.—Write me immy. on receipt of this</p>
         <p>Believe me yours sincerely<lb/>  W Colenso</p>
         <p>The wh. shirts just arrived (“no 500” I think) are most particularly small.</p>
