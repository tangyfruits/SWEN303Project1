         <p rend="end">Napier, March 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. 1885.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir George Grey</p>
         <p>I had much pleasure on Saturday last in receiving your kind note of 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. ulto., containing ₤1.10.0—for the 6 copies of my last little pamphlet printed here and sent to you: I could not, however, reply by the mail of that day going to Auckland. And now that I thank you for the same, I must also add,—that you have sent me <hi rend="italic">too much</hi>! as 6 x 4/. = 24/. I scarcely know which to choose, to send you the overplus in stamps,—or 2 additional copies of the work. I think I will send you (with this) one each of those 2 little books published here, as you have so generously approved of them.—</p>
         <p>I think the last little work has generally pleased,—judging from many kind notes received from various quarters, including Australia &amp; Europe. The question too, has been repeatedly asked, “Why those papers were no published in the usual way in the Trans. N.Z. Institute?” And I have been also asked, to get out more and larger ones: but this I think I shall not do,—unless I should republish with <hi rend="italic">considerable additions </hi>that early “Essay on the Maori Races”, written in 1865 under your kind auspices, and published in vol. I. of “Trans. N.Z. Inst.”—</p>
         <p>Thanks, my dear Sir George Grey for your kind wish of “an old age of health,” &amp;c.,—which perhaps, you will permit me heartily to reciprocate—as there cannot be a very great difference in our respective ages—and you, too, have undergone a <hi rend="italic">full share </hi>of fatigue and toil!</p>
         <p>I am happy to say that I enjoy good health with the full use of all my faculties and don’t need specs. My hands are full of work (mostly Botanical) and I daily labour hard at it, with a good share of writing: 3–4 times in the year I visit the forests &amp; glens &amp; solitudes of the lower Ruahine (E.), each time bringing away not a few spoils—novelties, now, however, mostly confined to the smaller crypts: I send a large share of them to my old friend at Kew, Sir J.D. Hooker.—</p>
         <p>Again thanking you,</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
