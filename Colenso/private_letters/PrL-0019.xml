         <p rend="end">Paihia, August 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1840.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>In speaking to our Storekeeper, a day or two ago, and desiring him, as usual, to forward me some Printing paper from the Public Store at Kerikeri, he informed me that the Paper was nearly finished; at which, I confess, I was somewhat surprised; not having entertained an idea of the kind. I immediately applied to our Secretary, to ascertain if any had been ordered, on which he referred to his Copies of Indents, and wrote me back, in answer, saying, “that none had been sent for.” A Vessel being now about to sail for Sydney, I write this, (with the Secretary’s and other members’ approbation), in order that some printing Paper may be forwarded us by very first ship.—</p>
         <p>In my Letter of Jany./36, I remarked on the <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> of the paper required for the New Zealanders: and am sorry to have to report that the paper which we have hitherto used is very inferior—<hi rend="italic">not in appearance</hi>—but in durability. It is very sad to see some of the New Testaments—not 3 years in use—quite destroyed; arising from the wretched quality of the paper.—A paper bleached with acids, and thus rendered so rotten, that even in passing through the Press, drying and folding. it deteriorates very much: the surface roughens, the strength passes, and it tears with hardly any resistance.—</p>
         <p>If, Sir, a paper could be procured, made from <hi rend="italic">Linen</hi> rag, the extra expense would be more than met in the durability of the Material. But if such a paper could not easily be obtained, I would recommend that it be slightly sized—somewhat in the manner that <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>writing paper is; which, I think, would be some help towards making Books for the New Zealanders more lasting.—</p>
         <p>“Babbage, on Manufacturers,” has an article on paper of great justice, and which ought to be read by all persons who are purchasers of paper, or publishers of works. From what little I have seen, I can, at least in part, affirm the same to be correct.</p>
         <p>We are advanced in printing the Psalms to the XC<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.—and, with the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> blessing, I trust that the Book of Psalms will be complete by the middle of November. At present the Correcting and preparing “for press”—correcting and revising for “working off”, compositing, warehousing, &amp;c, all falls on <hi rend="italic">one</hi> person, which makes the duty rather heavy. To complete the Psalms we shall require about 60 Ream: which is about the quantity at present in the Store.—</p>
         <p>Pray send us, Sir, at least, 200 Ream of strong Demy printing paper, of 20<hi rend="sup">lts</hi>. to the Ream: as soon as possible.</p>
         <p>My Last Letter to you, Sir, was dated Jany./40, pr. Matilda, which I trust came safely to hand.</p>
         <p>Praying that the Lord our God may guide you and us, <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, continually</p>
         <p>I am, Dr Sir,</p>
         <p>Very sincerely yours</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
