         <p>My dear Sir Donald</p>
         <p>I was in town yesterday &amp; heard of your having arrived,—but, supposing you would have <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of visitors, I did not call:—and today I suppose you are at the Ram Show:—I will hope to see you early next week.</p>
         <p>I received several new Books by last Mail, some of which I have thought you might like to see—that is, if you have any spare time.—</p>
         <p>I send you one of them, which I only commenced last evening, in reading pages 40–49 I again thought of you, and I think you will find something good in it—you will see it has reached the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Edition!—</p>
         <p>I have not yet seen Mr. Ormond since you and I last met.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well. I am</p>
         <p>     Yours very truly</p>
         <p>             W. Colenso</p>
