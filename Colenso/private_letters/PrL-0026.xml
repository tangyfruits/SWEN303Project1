         <p rend="end">Paihia, Bay Islands, N. Zealand,<lb/>July 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1841.</p>
         <p>Secretaries,<lb/>C.M.S. House,<lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs</p>
         <p>1. My last Communication to you, was dated Jany. 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1841, which, together with a parcel of Books, (both pr. “<hi rend="italic">Mars</hi>,” homeward bound whaler,) I trust you have safely received.</p>
         <p>2. Your Letter to us, of December 19/40, came to hand a few weeks back. I feel myself bound to thank the Committee for their kind decision therein expressed respecting myself, and trust, that no impediment whatever may arise to frustrate the carrying the same into effect. In consequence of that decision, I cannot <hi rend="italic">now </hi>have any reason to assign to the Committee for my returning to England; which, I hesitate not to say, was solicited, in order that (since I could not any longer with conscientious approval serve the Society, to whom I trusted I was still devotedly attached,) I might seek a situation, in New Zealand, more congenial with my inclinations, under some other Christian body. For the present then, my dear Sirs, I most willingly consent to remain in New Zealand; and would hope, through the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> blessing, I may never again have to ask permission to return to England:—a step, which, believe me, I shall <hi rend="italic">never</hi> be induced to take, unless impelled thereto. I very much regret that the Letter from Revd. Mr. Veres to me, (alluded to in Res. 3, of Com. of Corr., and, also, in par. 9, of your Letter to us,) has not been received. I have made every enquiry after it, at the Post Office here, and suppose that it could never, at least, have reached New Zealand. Shortly before your Letter to us arrived, I wrote (as a last resource) the Bishop of Australia, on the subject of admitting me to Orders; to which I have not yet received his Lordship’s answer. No vessels having come in from Sydney, since the arrival thither of that which took my Letter. </p>
         <p>3. By the vessel which takes the Mail containing this Letter, I send a paper parcel directed to you, in which are,—a faithful &amp; literal English Translation of those two Tracts (sent in last parcel) against the errors of the Romish Church.—Copies of those Tracts, in which the typographical errors are corrected,—and, a Ms. of Extracts from my Journal. The latter is for my Father, (who has often expressed his surprise at my never having given him any Information relative to my movements in N. Zealand,) and I would be much obliged in your forwarding it to him, by <hi rend="italic">Coach</hi>, as soon <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>as convenient. Should Mr. Broughton, or the Revd. J.W. Colenso, of Harrow, apply to you for a sight of the same, you will please to allow them to peruse it, ere it be sent on to my parents; but with the express understanding, that it must be returned to you as soon as possible, in order that it may be despatched on to Cornwall, without any <hi rend="italic">great</hi> delay. For I am very sure, that my parents, (who, perhaps, are far too anxiously solicitous on my account,) will not be satisfied until they receive it. I enclose, corrected printed Copies of those Tracts, in hopes that either yourselves, or the Protestant Association, or the Rel. Tract Society, will kindly print us a few thousands for distribution.—For I applied to our Committee, held a few days ago, that some Tracts might be printed against the errors of Rome, and received an answer thereto, “This request to remain over.” The English Translation I should have sent you before, but Lady Franklin (who has been paying N.Z. a visit,) much wished for a copy of the same; the doing of which has necessarily detained the Translation. Nearly the whole of the 8000 Tracts printed, are distributed; and I have already had evidence of their usefulness.—To mention an instance:—At Kororareka, the other day, the R.C. Bishop was endeavouring, as usual, to gain over a Chief of note, who had recently arrived from the neighbourhood of Cook’s Straits, desiring him to conform “<hi rend="italic">ki to Mahi Matua</hi>,” (to the Mother Church) telling him, that the Church of England was wrong, &amp;c, &amp;c. The Chief replied, that he would not have any thing to do with him or his Church. The R.C. Bishop, however, was not to be so easily induced to cease his specious oratory, on which the Chief took out one of those Tracts, (which he had brought with him from his village,) saying, “<hi rend="italic">Haere mai; he aha tenei e meinga nei e te Aroho pono ke ti Hahi pokaka o Roma</hi>?” (Draw hither, what (is) this here said by the True Love concerning the contrarily-inventing Church of Rome?) On which, the Bishop gathered up his robes and walked quickly away, much to the chuckling satisfaction of the Natives there assembled. Should any be printed, pray let them have covers stitched on them, and, I think, it would also be advisable to have both made to form <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Book. Since my last Letter the R.C. Bishop has had an accession of 4 Priests and 8 Catechists, together with a Printing press, &amp;c, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>4. I hope, my dear Sirs, that you have forewarded us a good supply of printing paper. Our press had holyday for about 10 days (!) (not so, however, the printer,) when a small supply arrived from Sydney: this will soon be expended. I hope in a <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>very little while to send you copies of the Prayer Book, complete with all its Services; in the printing of which I am now advanced to the Solemnization of Matrimony.—</p>
         <p>5. I would here beg to submit these requests of mine for the kind consideration of the Committee. 1. That the Committee be pleased to grant their Printing-Office a Bracket Timepiece with a large face, as I have had no small difficulty in getting the workmen I have hitherto employed in being any thing like punctual to their hours. 2. That the Committee be pleased to grant me a <hi rend="italic">good </hi>silver Hunting watch, as the one I had kindly given me in England by the Society, was well nigh worn out, and cost me more in repeated repairs than its original price. I have advantageously sold it for £4., which Sum the Com. will be pleased to accept in part towards another: it should, however, be a <hi rend="underline italic">good</hi> one; as here they scruple not to charge £1.1.0 for merely rectifying a watch! 3. That the Committee (seeing that I have never received any Books from the Society) will be pleased to grant me the following Books:—</p>
         <p>Burnet’s History of þe Reformation,</p>
         <p>Mosheim’s Ecclesiastical History,</p>
         <p>Milner, with Scott’s continuation,</p>
         <p>Nowell’s Catechism,</p>
         <p>Canons of þe Church of England,</p>
         <p>Jewell’s apology &amp; reply,</p>
         <p>Fox’s Martyrs—<hi rend="italic">complete </hi>ed.,</p>
         <p>McCulloch’s Commercial Dictionary, <hi rend="italic">last</hi> ed.,</p>
         <p>Latin Vulgate, and</p>
         <p>a good and <hi rend="italic">comprehensive</hi> Latin Dictionary,</p>
         <p>with any others they may think proper.</p>
         <p>6. You will please advise the paying of £<hi rend="italic">5.5.0</hi> on my account, to Mr. J. Reynolds of Penzance, for shoes supplied; and also, of £<hi rend="italic">12.10.0</hi> to Coney, 125, Minorias, for Linen, &amp;c. I confess, I was not a little surprised at Coney’s writing to N. Zealand for payment of his small a/c, the order for which he had received through the C.M. House. I trust that his doing so was entirely of himself. Once for all, permit me to say, that I am <hi rend="italic">not </hi>a <hi rend="italic">pecuniary </hi>Debtor to the Society, neither, by <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> blessing, will I ever become such, whatever the account at <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, in my name, may apparently shew against me; I take care to keep <hi rend="italic">within </hi>compass, and to <hi rend="italic">square </hi>my little accounts <hi rend="italic">here</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">yearly</hi>. I cannot comprehend Coney’s a/c, as delivered to me; he says, the <hi rend="italic">whole </hi>amount I owe him is £<hi rend="underline italic">13.9.2</hi>, but only mentions items, in his Bill to me, amounting to £<hi rend="italic">11.15.1</hi>. I have written him saying, <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>that if he shews Mr Coates my being indebted the sum of £13.9.2 to Mr Coney, Mr Coates will discharge the same: which I will thank you to do.</p>
         <p>Please procure and send me, 1 ream of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> T.W. Foolscap, faintlined blue as for <hi rend="italic">long</hi> folio. I have so very much writing to do now, in Translating, preparing for press, &amp;c, &amp;c, (in addition to my duties in the Pg Office,) that such paper will prove a valuable auxiliary.</p>
         <p>The blessed boon of 5,000 Testaments have arrived, and are in Circulation. It will not be long ere the whole will be disposed of. Even with this supply, I am obliged to deny them to some who come with their <hi rend="italic">dollar</hi> in their hand to purchase a “Covenant.”—Last week, Mr Davis’ third son, Coleman, died; he had been ill for several weeks. The father is greatly affected at his loss, but bows, as a Christian, to the dispensation; knowing whose the rod is, and who appointed it.</p>
         <p>The vessel sails this evening: so I must hurry off to the Post office on the opposite shore. May the Lord, grant, my dear Sirs, that you and me may be graciously guided by Him in all things to His praise and glory!</p>
         <p>And believe me</p>
         <p>very truly and sincerely yours,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
