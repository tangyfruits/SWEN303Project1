         </p>
         <p>My dear sirs,</p>
         <p>1. My last letter to you was dated, April 4/53, which will I hope in due time reach your hands.—</p>
         <p>2. Having just heard of an opportunity for Wellington I hasten to write a few lines—to accompany a portion of my Journal (124pp.,) all that I have copied out, &amp; which you ought to have received from me long ago. The more so, as, I think, it contains somewhat elucidatory of the Bishops dealings with me.—</p>
         <p>3. But, a Wellington Paper—(“the N. Zealand Spectator,”) of the 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. February, (a Copy of which I suppose—and <hi rend="underline italic">hope</hi>—you have had sent you thence,) which contains a full account of a “Church of England Meeting” there, in which the Governor, the Bishop, and Archdn. Hadfield took prominent parts, will, I believe, do more still towards revealing the Bishop’s mind (not to say, the Governor’s,) towards myself &amp; the Natives of this District. The speeches of the Governor, of the Bishop, &amp; of Archdeacon Hadfield, in this paper, which I have only lately read, <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>serve me as a key to much that the Bishop has said, as well as to his strange &amp; harsh proceedings concerning <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. While, on the other hand, they will ever serve to shew, what has been effected through <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> blessing on my unworthy instrumentality.—</p>
         <p>4. Two (hitherto) steady Teachers (who have been here with me a few days, and who only left this morning,) informed me, that many of those things which I had successfully opposed and put down—such as Cardplaying, Draughts, Racing, Games, Riding about on Sundays, singing Heathen Songs and dancing Heathen dances, the working of the <hi rend="italic">Teachers</hi> for the Settlers, Drinking of wine &amp; strong drink, &amp;c., &amp;c.,—are now being commonly &amp; extensively practised, “through” (they say) “the licence given by the new Minister; who” (they also say) “has said, that seeing that the Settlers do so, the Natives may do the same, but not to excess.” Hence, most of the Natives (including, I regret to say, some of those who, <hi rend="italic">under curb</hi>, had proved useful as Teachers,) and all the Settlers rejoice greatly. Some of the Settlers remarked to those two Teachers, (whose 2 villages are, I am told, almost alone in standing out against those innovations,) that now they <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>would succeed nicely, now that they had got this Minister; to which they replied,—“Ah! you say so because he is a Minister of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sides (<hi rend="italic">taha rua</hi>); whereas, our former one was a Minister of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> side (<hi rend="italic">taha tahi</hi>), a Native like us.” I do not mean to say, that I am certain that Mr.<hi rend="italic"> S</hi>. Williams has gone so far; I would still hope not; notwithstanding I am in a great degree inclined to believe the above, not only from the altering state of things, which I both hear and see; but, also, from what I saw when at Te Waimate; and from a conversation that I had with Archdn. Hadfield last year at Wairarapa, in which he said, that I was much too strict with regard to the Sabbath, &amp;c., and, that he saw no harm in Natives going to Balls, &amp; Games, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>5. Be this as it may, one thing is certain, that all the good which has been effected in this District has been done through the simple and plain teaching and preaching of Justification by Faith <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>; helped, perhaps, by an equally simple <hi rend="italic">N. Testament</hi> discipline applied with <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>. For which (I am given to understand,) is now to be <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>substituted, “the regular and often Administration of the Sacrament,” (<hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Baptized being, also “<hi rend="italic">Regenerates</hi>,”) and a laxity of discipline; which, I take upon myself to predict, will, in a very short time, assuredly destroy the very vitals of a true Christian and living Church in these parts.—</p>
         <p>6. Most of the principal Chiefs have been here several times of late to condole with me, &amp;c.; Hapuku, Puhara, Hineipaketia, Waihiku, Te Aẁi, Taylor Te Paea, and others. They have begged me <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to leave them, and have liberally offered to give me the choice of a good piece of ground in various places to reside on, which they have urged me to accept. But I have told them (as I told the Bishop,) that I shall patiently await <hi rend="italic">your decision</hi> respecting me.—I have, also, overheard them saying many hard things of the Bishop, and some shrewd questions have been asked me; but I have cautiously conducted myself in respect to all such. The Chiefs have, also, asked, for what purpose did the Governor come here? As he scarcely spoke to them upon any subject;—but, I <hi rend="italic">believe</hi>, that the Bishop (knowing my great influence here,) <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>got his Excellency to accompany him to strengthen him against me, hoping, indeed, to prevail. I give <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> thanks, continually, that I was enabled to withstand both the Bishop’s and Mr.<hi rend="italic"> S</hi>. Williams’ united efforts on the night of their visit.</p>
         <p>7. I hope soon to send you the <hi rend="italic">remainder</hi> of my Journal. I have been, and am, engaged in putting my winter’s residence into order, in binding Native Testaments &amp; P. Books, in printing a memoir of Caleb Te Hiaro, and other Natives of this District, in giving out Medicine, &amp;c. </p>
         <p>8. I have not yet received the balance of my Salary of <hi rend="italic">last</hi> year; but hope soon to obtain it; as, I suppose, Archdn. W. Williams (if safe) will have arrived at Turanga by this time, who will, I dare believe, do what is right.—</p>
         <p>9. Of the Case of New Testaments (mentioned in my Letter of Jany. 31/53, par. 20,) I have already sold upwards of <hi rend="italic">£5</hi>. worth; and should have sold more could I but take their produce (Potatoes, wheat, &amp;c.) in payment. <hi rend="bold">[6]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Praying continually that <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> will guide you in your considering and deciding upon my unhappy case, and craving an interest in your Prayers,</p>
         <p>I am,<lb/>My dear sirs,<lb/>Your very unworthy servant,<lb/>William Colenso.</p>
