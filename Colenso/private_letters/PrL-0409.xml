         <p>Mr John Drummond</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Last might I was much pleased in receiving a letter from you,—to find you writing in such good spirits, having plenty of work, &amp; able and willing to notice beauty—whether of art or of nature; would that I had more young correspondents like you—here in N. Zealand.</p>
         <p>I was also pleased to know that you had received that last (&amp; big) paper, containing that drawing of the wondrous cave; all right, for I had feared it would get crushed in transit. If you copy it in oil (as you say) don’t hurry, take time over it; You know the old saying—“Good work takes time”. I hope you also received some papers and Pictures I had formerly sent you—one I recollect well, as I admired it, thinking what a <hi rend="italic">telling</hi> painting the original must be—it was termed “The Brigands”. I hope to send you some more, soon, I have some <hi rend="italic">old</hi> ones here in store for you.­</p>
         <p>Your animalculæ—or eels in vinegar,—also pleases me, that is <hi rend="italic">your noticing</hi> them. These are very common—all over the world; also, similar ones found in sour thin paste made of flour. They have sever­al remarkable qualities; 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> they are viviparous; if one of them is cut through the middle, several minute oval bodies will issue forth; these are young ones, each coiled up in its own proper fine membrane, this soon bursts when they unroll themselves and wriggle about &amp; grow; a 100 have been seen to issue from one eel, hence they soon swarm to such a degree—whether in sour paste or vinegar—. Such animals are to be found in all waters, all infusions, as of chopped hay, pepper, boiled turnip, carrot, hempseed, any &amp; everything, &amp; mostly different kinds.—</p>
         <p>The one you mention is called, <hi rend="italic">Vibrio acete</hi>, or Vinegar eel; it has a mouth &amp; lips, stomache, &amp;c, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>Many of them are wonderfully beautiful—in their colours, shapes, &amp; markings, under a microscope, though <hi rend="italic">invisible</hi> to the naked eye.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Do not give yourself any concern whatever</hi> about the Bal. you mention—that I have no doubt, will come all right in time.—</p>
         <p>A delightful rain commenced here yesterday at noon, and it has rained steadily ever since; it will do much good, as it has been long desired.</p>
         <p>May this find you well, &amp; doing well, and with best wishes for your welfare, believe me to be, yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Should you happen to meet with anything new or strange—stone, shell, common Maori stone, axe &amp;c. &amp;c., keep it for me.</p>
