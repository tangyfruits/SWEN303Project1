         <p rend="end">Napier, June 5/85</p>
         <p>My dear Dr. Von Haast</p>
         <p>Last week I received a telegram from you, saying,— “You would return Buller &amp; Quatrefages in a fortnight”: it was dated from “Wellington,” which surprised me. As Locke was <hi rend="italic">returning</hi> from Povy. Bay, I waited for his arrival: and now that I have seen him, &amp; find he is off for Wellington, I write to say, Don’t send those books here to me but let Locke see them <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, at Wgn. I have talked w. Locke <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Dog &amp; Moa, &amp; he thinks, w. me,—that you would find <hi rend="italic">all that we know</hi> in my <hi rend="italic">2 papers</hi> in “Transactions.”</p>
         <p>I should have written to you earlier, but I have only just ascertained from Dobson <hi rend="italic">where </hi>to find you.——</p>
         <p>I hear you are going to England—anon. I wish to ask you,—If I send a few Moa bones whether you could name them for me? I have but a few, and, w. the exception of one bird, all <hi rend="italic">single</hi> bones. I would not send you <hi rend="italic">all</hi>—only a few in good condition, say of 3 or 4 spns. and perhaps those (3) of <hi rend="italic">one </hi>leg of another I have from Povy. Bay. Of course I pay all expenses up and down. Please let me know,</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
