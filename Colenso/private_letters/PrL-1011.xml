         <p rend="end">Napier, September 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
            <lb/>1897.</p>
         <p>Mr. Wm. Gordon,<lb/>New Plymouth.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I duly received your Letter of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst., and now that I have just finished my letters, &amp;c. for the outgoing S.F. Mail, I turn to you—to answer in <hi rend="italic">part</hi> yours.—</p>
         <p>I have a kind of hazy floating notion that I wrote to you <hi rend="italic">after</hi> my accident on 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. April: but memory &amp; faculties generally suffered so much on that occasion that I am not certain.</p>
         <p>I returned to Napier from Bush District an invalid on 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. July—have only been three times in the town (the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. time yesterday—pressing business) since I returned. My legs are still <hi rend="italic">very weak</hi>—out of doors: right hand and arm much better, but still wanting muscular power,—cannot grasp—hold on with fingers so as to use a knife to cut bread, meat, &amp;c., nor to sharpen a lead pencil, &amp;c. On the whole however “daily improving” (the stock phrase!) and am pretty well in general health. Can write (as you may see) but <hi rend="underline italic">feel</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> it</hi> if too much: and I have had a heavy amount to do lately, which has tired me.—</p>
         <p>Now to your enquiries, &amp;c.—I can only reply <hi rend="italic">partly</hi> today.—<hi rend="italic">Re </hi>your question on the word “<hi rend="italic">ture</hi>” = law: it is <hi rend="italic">not </hi>a Maori word. At the time of our (the Missionaries) early translations, 60–80 years ago, we found several words for which there was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> equivalent in Maori,—as gold, silver, money, sheep, corn, peach, King, temple, hour, <hi rend="italic">law</hi>, &amp;c., &amp;c. Some, however, could be well used and printed as the Maoris would pronounce the English word in common use, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be misunderstood; but this word <hi rend="italic">law</hi> was not of that class. So we fell back (for Bible rendering) on the Hebrew word for <hi rend="italic">law</hi>—TORAH (in Rom. characters): but <hi rend="italic">TORA </hi>being an objectionable Maori word it was altered to <hi rend="italic">ture</hi>: and so, after times, when this Country was Colonized, the word (being now well understood by the Maories) was retained and fixed for <hi rend="italic">law</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I am pleased to have the opportunity of giving you its true derivation: the rest of your letter must stand over for a time; I hope to return to it ere long: I have still “lots” of letters to answer. I do not clearly understand you when you say,— “simply a few lines saying what you think of the whole work, &amp;c, &amp;c.” What is this “<hi rend="italic">work</hi>”?—Should I forget, through shattered memory &amp; multiplicity of matters daily increasing, do you remind me: shall always be glad to hear from you.—</p>
         <p>I am, yours faithfully,<lb/>  W. Colenso.</p>
