         <p rend="end">Napier July 30/66</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Many thanks for your kind note of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. By this Mail I send you 2 boxes of Roots (<hi rend="italic">Caladium </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Batatas</hi>?) for Dr. Hooker, which please frank &amp; forward.—I gave up the idea of sending the <hi rend="italic">Caladium</hi>, as it was beginning to sprout—but I have selected, &amp;c, &amp;c, and they <hi rend="underline italic">may</hi> get home living,—or, <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of them. If you would like a few roots—or Sir George—I could send you some; let me know.—I am right glad you have a <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Senecio</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">rotundif. </hi>for Dr. Hooker. You had not previously informed me of it.—(I should like to have a <hi rend="italic">leaf</hi>.) I am writing to Auckland, to ask about price, &amp;c., of British Herbarium, &amp; will let you know, when I get a reply.</p>
         <p>The English Maori Elementary Books (Ms.) <hi rend="italic">were sent to Col. Russell</hi>” Rolleston acknowledged <hi rend="italic">receipt</hi> of them, in the Col’s. absence.</p>
         <p>I look upon it as a great — something — that those Essays have not been published. I should have thought, that the first one,—or one<hi rend="italic">s</hi>,—printed should have been sold immedy.,—as you say “as independent pamphlets”, or Essays,—and so have made some small return. I am glad you have written about them, and I hope they (or some of them) will be forthcoming shortly.—For many reasons I wished my <hi rend="italic">Maori</hi> one to be “out”—I have repeatedly promised Dr Hooker, &amp; others, at home, a Copy &amp; now Dr. H. says (speaking of Crawford—Malay linguist)—that “I had better make haste, as he is 86” &amp;c &amp;c—Is <hi rend="italic">that</hi> Essay printed? and if so, could I get <hi rend="italic">one </hi>Copy <hi rend="italic">for Crawford</hi>?—On second thoughts, I suppose it is not yet, as Mr. Thomson (your Otago surveyor) also wrote to me about Crawford &amp; his wish to see it, and he is on the spot.</p>
         <p>I hope you are well, I often think of you &amp; Wgn. A smart-<hi rend="italic">ish </hi>shock of earthq. last evening at X min past 8, with its usual precursor rumble—coming from your direction. Believe me</p>
         <p>Very truly yours</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
