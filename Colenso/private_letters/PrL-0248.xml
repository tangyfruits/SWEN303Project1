         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>July 1/69 (night)</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours of 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. ult. is only <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to hand: and though I can badly afford time, (being hard up, writing for English Mail,) must try to reply.</p>
         <p>I cannot find any time at present to do any thing towards republishing that Essay <hi rend="italic">in an enlarged form</hi>,—unless the Govt. would first consent to liberate me for a while, as I have an abiding recollection of being already unpleasantly taken to task by the Govt. (Col. Russell) for past loss of time (through writing those 2 Essays, &amp; for Dr. H’s. Hand Book)—which caused much Official Correspondence.—</p>
         <p>I feel assured they would not (perhaps <hi rend="italic">could </hi>not?) so relax, or liberate me for a while;—and I should not (<hi rend="italic">in these times</hi>) willingly agree to stoppage of allowance. Last offl. Letters (of 1868), Mr. Richmond’s, were peremptory, that the Work <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be ready by April 1/70—!!</p>
         <p>Besides, I think (hurriedly) that a republishing of it in an <hi rend="italic">enlarged form</hi> just now would scarcely be fair or Courteous to your Phil. Socy.</p>
         <p>If, however, <hi rend="italic">you are willing </hi>that it should be republished <hi rend="italic">as it is</hi>, with the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> &amp; the <hi rend="italic">Table</hi> added (which would make it more popular), &amp; a few necessary slight corrections, I am quite agreeable, and would leave with you the making all needful arrangements with the Printer &amp; Publisher.</p>
         <p>I scribble this hastily to be in time for “Rangatira”, which, I hear is to leave tomorrow.</p>
         <p rend="center">———</p>
         <p>May I ask—Do you send Copies of the “Transactions” to Sir G. Grey, Dr Hooker, Bp. of Lichfield, &amp; Mr. Darwin?—perhaps you will kindly tell me when you next write.</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yr. sincerely</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
