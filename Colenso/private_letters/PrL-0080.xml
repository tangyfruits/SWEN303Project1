         <p>To</p>
         <p>The Secretaries<lb/>C.M. House<lb/>Salisbury Sq.<lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>1. On the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. instant I received a packet from the Rev. J. Hamlin (who had recently returned to his Station from attending the Annual local Comee.<hi rend="sup"> </hi>at Turanga, containing:—</p>
         <p>1. A copy of your Letter to the Ven. Archd. W. Williams, dated Feby. 24/48, respecting the a/c of expenses incurred by me in establishing this Station, &amp;c., and enclosing a Copy of the Resolution of the Comee. of Corr., dated Feby. 1/48:—and,</p>
         <p>2. A copy of “Extract of Minutes of E.D. Comee., held at Uawa, May 6/47”:—and</p>
         <p>3. A Letter from the Archdn.<hi rend="sup"> </hi>of the District, dated Jany. 30/49, in which (referring to the foregoing,) he says,— “You will see, by a Letter of the Society, a Copy of which is enclosed, that they wished further information about your first a/c. The observations of this Comee. they have long ere this received. I send you a copy of them extracted from the Minutes”.—</p>
         <p>2. I thought, when I sent you the Copy of the a/cs of expenses incurred in establishing this Station, I had so plainly stated a few facts in simple language, that I should not have to write again upon the subject. With the Resoln. of the Comee. of Corresp. I feel particularly pleased; and so, perhaps, I may generally say of your accompanying Letter. Although you state, that many of the Charges therein appear to the Commee. to be high, especially with regards to his entertaining an European <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>Carpenter in almost constant pay. All I have to say in reply to those remarks, in addition to what I wrote and sent with the a/cs is—</p>
         <p>1. That as you have not particularly pointed out those Charges which “appear to you to be high,” and as I do not know them, I cannot offer any explanatory remark upon them;—<hi rend="italic">the prices paid to the Natives for the erection of the houses</hi>, have always been considered as being <hi rend="italic">remarkably low</hi>. I could not, I solemnly assure you, <hi rend="italic">now</hi> get the same work done here for the same amount of money notwithstanding all my influence. </p>
         <p>2. That in reference to your remark,— “Especially with regard to his entertaining an European Carpenter in almost contract pay”.—Let us examine this:—</p>
         <p> I believe the Sums charged to the C.M.S., for this man’s labor, during 2 years, is £<hi rend="italic">35</hi>., for which sum (or, rather, no more has been debited against the C.M.S.,) he has done, not only all the Carpenter’s work of the 4 houses of the Station, (as well as made Gates, glazed windows, painted ditto &amp; doors, repaired Canoes, made windows for distant Chapels, (without including those for Station Chapel,) made wheelbarrow, Lesson boards, &amp;c., but, also, built 3 Chimnies, laid mud floors, cut a drain beneath the house &amp; filled it with blocks of pumice, stored and unpacked goods, stores, &amp;c., (at first an arduous task,) burnt and mixed Lime, Superintended Native Workmen, assisted in making up pills and other Medicines, &amp;c.,—and, in short, generally helped about Public Work, which, had he not done, or not have been here to do, I could not possibly have travelled as I did during the first year of our residence, in which I was absent <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>(see Report and Journal) 163 days. But I am very well content for the Archdeacon’s Carpenter, or for any other Carpenter, to value the Carpenter’s work <hi rend="underline italic">alone</hi> of the station; which I believe, will exceed the sum of £35. Of course, you are well aware that there is a vast difference between the amount of work done by a Carpenter working at home in a workshop where he has every thing at his hand, and a man just thrown on a wild shore, having not only every thing to do for himself, but, also, to make and fix handles to the new tools, to file and grind &amp; sharpen them, to fix his grindstone, make his bench, and many other things of that kind, as well as to hew down timber (sometimes trees) of irregular thicknesses (supplied by Natives) ere it can be used for his work, (which in other places is done by Sawyers, &amp;c.,) and all this, and much more, while being continually thronged on all sides by a rude Heathen people.[Allow, me to add;—This man, a Communicant and a good Christian, is still with me, having entered on his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year in my employ, during which his <hi rend="italic">work</hi> (I may safely say,) has altogether been of a Public nature. He has not remained with me for the sake of wages, for I have only paid him about £<hi rend="italic">30</hi>. pr. ann.,—(the whole of which might very justly have been allowed him by the C.M.S.,)—but, because he wished for a quiet situation. His name is Keir; he is of a highly respectable Scotch family, and formerly held one of the principal Breweries in Edinburgh: the better Class of Natives respect him much.]</p>
         <p>3. The extract of minutes of the E.D. Commee. held at Uawa, May 6/47—although entirely relating to myself—I have only now heard of. And when I consider that I sent <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>the original of my a/c with my remarks thereupon to you <hi rend="italic">through</hi> that Comee., that they might fully know what I had forwarded, I cannot but conclude that they ought to have made me acquainted with their Minutes upon the same.—</p>
         <p>Those Minutes, six in number, I will now remark on—<hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi>.</p>
         <p>The Ist., upon “the sum of £70 being allowed me, &amp;c.,”—and the same “being considered sufficient outlay for a mere temporary dwelling;”—I only have to remark:—</p>
         <p>—That the houses on my Station are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> “mere temporary dwellings”, as those know who have seen them.</p>
         <p>The IInd., (which I quote <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi>,)— “A similar sum was assigned to Mr. Hamlin, who found it enough to pay the erection of a building which accommodates his family, though very much more numerous than that of Mr. Colenso.”—</p>
         <p>Upon this minute I would remark:—</p>
         <p>1. That Mr. Hamlin did not <hi rend="italic">pay for the </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">erection</hi> of a building for himself, which he himself had ordered, but rather purchased an old building, which had been erected some time before my visit in 1843, when the Archdeacon &amp; myself pitched our tents in it; and which then appeared to be in a weak state, through poor materials &amp; workmanship:—</p>
         <p>2. There is no comparison whatever (and let the Archdeacon who has often seen both judge) between Mr. Hamlin’s Dwelling-house and mine—in respect of size, materials, labor, and workmanship. Mine being much <hi rend="italic">larger</hi>; the wood, <hi rend="italic">totara</hi>, in massy slabs brought from a great distance (there being none at hand); while that of Mr. Hamlin’s is <hi rend="italic">kahikatea</hi> (white pine, the most <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>inferior in durable quality of all the N. Zealand timbers; (from woods growing close by; and the workmanship of my dwelling is much superior to that of Mr. Hamlins, Besides, my Dwelling-house has a floored Verandah, 48 x 8;—the whole of these premises had, from their low and marshy situation, to be drained, by cutting a drain around them;—they possess three (now 6) strongly built Chimnies, the stone of which had to be brought from Ahuriri, 7 miles distant, by Natives; while Mr. Hamlin’s has only two;—and I have, also, a detached Study and printing room , the materials and workmanship of which are far superior even to that of the Dwelling-house. </p>
         <p>3. That there is no parallel whatever between Mr. Hamlin &amp; myself:—for Mr. Hamlin removed to Te Wairoa from an old Station, where he had always lived alone, and, consequently must have had very many such things as Tools of all kinds, and sundry Public Stores, (as nails, screws, glass, Paint, oils, Iron, Grindstone, &amp;c.,)—and, also, Doors, Windows, &amp;c., all of which I had to purchase before I left the Bay, otherwise I must have lived here as a Native, or have subsequently waited until I got such a supply.—</p>
         <p>4. That such was the condition of Mr. Hamlin’s house, that it was deemed necessary for the Builder, who had just finished the Archdeacon’s, to commence erecting a wooden one for Mr. Hamlin without loss of time, and which is, I believe, now nearly finished,—while my house is still <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, and (as I said before) will serve me for many years to come. (casualties excepted), with perhaps the addition of a new coat of thatch on the roof every 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. or 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. year.—<hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>Perhaps I should here observe that in ordering a house to be erected, when here with the Archdeacon in 1843, I did not order it to be of the size which the Natives built it, but as they had put up a very <hi rend="italic">large</hi> &amp; substantial Chapel, so they thought proper to put up an extra large and extra good house for the Minister of the same.</p>
         <p>The IIIrd.,—The “proposal made by the Commee.<hi rend="sup"> </hi>through Archd. W. Williams” (verbal, I presume,) to allow me for the amount of what nails, glass, &amp;c., should be left on hand, after my house had been finished; the said “amount to be considered part of the sum to be hereafter expended on a more substantial house.”—</p>
         <p>I have to remark on this:—</p>
         <p>1. That I neither did, nor do, want a “more substantial dwelling”.—</p>
         <p>2. That if I had acceded to this proposal, I should not have had a nail which I could have given out for the erecting of a single Chapel, nor for a Coffin, without an application to the Commee.—</p>
         <p>3. That all those Stores were already far too much injured, (see next par. seq.) and would be too much exposed (having, in fact, been all since submersed, and likely to be so again,) to think of keeping them laid by for so long a period as they were then likely to be; and, perhaps, when about to be used, found not to be suitable.—</p>
         <p>4. That it was in a great measure my misfortune rather than choice that I became possessed of so many “Stores” of a certain kind; such as hinges, nails, and some <hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>(to me) almost useless. For, on my return to the Waimate, from visiting these parts (having been sent hither by the Bishop,) in the early part of 1844, I found—that a great number of things had lately arrived from England for Te Wairoa Station, but charged against, and paid for by, the Rev. W.C. Dudley—that Mr. Dudley, wishing to get rid of them as quickly as possible, had disposed of much of the more useful of these articles, and the remainder were left upon his hands—that Mr. Dudley seemed to feel it, and often spoke about it—that I agreed to take all he had left at Invoice price, (which I, afterwards, found to amount to £48.1.5. ) without seeing many of them—and, that some of them were subsequently found to have been much wetted with Salt water. And, further,—that on the arrival of Archd. W. Williams at the Waimate, I was informed that some of the <hi rend="italic">Stores</hi> for Mr. Dudley had been landed at Poverty Bay—that I also agreed to take them (not knowing exactly what they were)—that on my arrival in Poverty Bay (in Dec /44,) on my way to my Station, those Stores were sent on board—that I afterwards paid the bill of the same (furnished by the Archdeacon) amounting to £40.13.0.—that among other items were the following,— “Locks” (rusty) “20/3: files 5/6: Butt hinges 10/10: Gimlets, 3 doz. 7/7: Guages 6/2: Flasks &amp; Nails £9.16.3.” (the nails were dreadfully rusted, being so caked together, that we were obliged to burn them in a strong fire before we could separate them one from another) all of which were of little use to me, I having those things by me already—and that my own private <hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>loss in a great many of those Stores (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> charged by me in my a/c with C.M.S.) has been very considerable.—</p>
         <p>And here it may truly enough be asked, “What could have induced you to buy stores to such an extent, and that too without seeing them?” To which I must briefly reply,—that I needed a sufficiency of Stores to begin a new Station with—that I did not know they would come to so much—that they were scattered, some at the Kerikeri, some at Kororareka, and others at Poverty Bay—that I had not a moment’s time to lose, being then very busy preparing for ordination—and that the whole having been ordered for a new Station (Te Wairoa) by the Archdeacon, I fully believed they would all prove useful for Ahuriri.</p>
         <p>The remark of the E.D. Comee. which follows this (their III<hi rend="sup">rd.</hi>) minute, of theirs, I cannot but consider most uncalled for,—and that without for a moment denying the truth of it.—Because,</p>
         <p>1. At every station throughout the Island, those kind of houses have been erected for the missionaries.—</p>
         <p>2. Although I have seen many, I have not seen any more roomy, or more substantially put together, or more carefully fenced round and supplied with Gates, &amp;c., so as to provide (as far as may be) against casualty, than those of this Station.—</p>
         <p>3. In my last journey throughout N. Zealand, I found, at several of the Mission Stations which had been some years established, those kind of houses still in use at Rotorua, Tauranga, Otaẁao, &amp; Waikato, <hi rend="bold">[9] </hi>as well as at Uawa, and Turanga; some of which dwellings had stood for many years.</p>
         <p>4. During my residence in this country, from 1834, I have not known a single Mission Dwelling house of <hi rend="italic">this kind</hi> to have been destroyed by fire. But, on the contrary,</p>
         <p>The wooden house of Mr. Parker of Paihia;</p>
         <p>The wooden house of the Archdeacon at Turanga;</p>
         <p>The wooden house of the Rev. R. Maunsell, at Waikato; &amp;</p>
         <p> The wooden house of Rev. G. Kissling, at Auckland;</p>
         <p>were all destroyed by fire! The Archdeacon’s when on the eve of finishing!! Mr. Maunsell’s after he had only been in it a fortnight!!! While their old &amp; “<hi rend="italic">most dangerous raupo</hi>” dwellings are standing to this day!</p>
         <p>The IV<hi rend="sup">th. </hi>Minute shall be very briefly despatched;—because 1. the Commee. only then (six months after the date of my accounts, and nearly 2 years after I had put Doors, Windows, Desk, Com. table, &amp;c., in the Church,) “propose to allow for Reading Desks, &amp;c.”; and that only “<hi rend="underline italic">when the Natives are willing to erect such buildings as will fairly warrant such expenditure</hi>”; which of course, (fairly reasoning from analogy) means,—when they shall erect <hi rend="italic">wooden</hi> buildings, which will not I believe, be done in my day. And,</p>
         <p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Concerning the “offer to contribute—made through the Archdeacon,” (verbally I presume,) for I have no precise recollection of it—I confess I should certainly not have accepted a <hi rend="italic">Contribution</hi> from my brethren for such a purpose, for in such cases, I could only look on it as a loan to be repaid, whenever they should proceed <hi rend="bold">[10] </hi>to set in order their own Chapels.</p>
         <p>The V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.<hi rend="italic">— </hi>“Medicines had been provided for the Ahuriri Station, as well as that at Te Wairoa by the Commee.; but the Medicines of which Mr. Colenso speaks were sent for without any reference to the Commee. Several Members of the Mission, both in the Northern and Middle Districts, have sent for Medicine Chests which they have paid for on private account.”—</p>
         <p>Let me examine this:—</p>
         <p>1. “Medicines had been provided for the Ahuriri Station, as well as for that at Te Wairoa”:—</p>
         <p>Granted:—but, (as I said before,)—</p>
         <p>α. Mr Hamlin came from an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Station where he had been <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, consequently the Doctor of that place and neighbourhood, and, doubtless possessing many medicines, including Scales and weights, glasses, mortars, pallet knives, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>β<hi rend="italic">. </hi>Annexed is a list of all the Medicines which I received on board our vessel from the Archdeacon while at Turanga; copied, <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi>, from the Archdeacon’s letter.<note xml:id="ftn1-103" place="foot" n="103">

               <p>Salts—to be taken from Mr. Hamlin’s Cask.</p>
               <p>               (Signed) W. Williams.”</p>
            </note> Surely I need not point out what are required in addition to them.</p>
         <p>γ.<hi rend="italic"> </hi>It may, however, be here remarked, “That I was known to have a tolerably good assortment, if not stock, of Medicines, when residing at Paihia”:—Granted:—but, 1. before the arrival of Mr. Ford, as Surgeon, I had the whole Surgery in my house and under my Care; but on his arrival he took away every thing,—and, <hi rend="bold">[11] </hi>
         </p>
         <p>2. Afterwards I obtained some more from the Kerikeri Store, in common with Archd. Williams and Mr. Baker, (before Mr. Baker’s removal to the substation at the Waikare,) but on Mr. Ford’s resigning his Situation as Surgeon, the Natives came as before to me for relief, and there being no longer any Public Store to draw from, my little stock soon become exhausted. [Vide reports of those years, 1841, 1842, 1843.]</p>
         <p>2. “The medicines of which Mr. Colenso speaks were sent for without any reference to the Commee:—</p>
         <p>       True:—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">α. </hi>For how could I possibly have referred to the E.D. Commee. (or to any other Comee.,) at the time of my sending for those Medicines? They being sent for, through the C.M.S., (in common with many Stores of a Public nature,) in July 1842. (Hudson’s invoice is dated, Feb. 1843.) All of which things were ordered, prospectively—believing that I should soon be sent somewhere to the South, and knowing that<hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">I</hi> had no Public Store to draw from. (Which <hi rend="italic">benefit</hi>, be it remembered <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my brethren had who preceded me.) </p>
         <p>β. Yet, they were not wholly selected nor sent for upon my own unprofessional responsibility; Mr. Ford, then our Surgeon, well-knowing what I required both for myself and for the Natives, kindly guided me in this matter; for which I still feel grateful.—</p>
         <p>3. “Several members of the Mission, both in the Northern &amp; Middle Districts, have sent for Medicine Chests, which they have paid for on private accounts.” <hi rend="bold">[12]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Very true, indeed; and very proper too.—</p>
         <p>(and I know some of the persons alluded to;) but, there is a wonderful difference between the two Cases. They sent for Medicine <hi rend="doubleunderline underline italic">Chests</hi>—elegantly fitted-up articles—principally, because they were portable, &amp; retained the Medicines in nicely-stopped vessels, &amp;c.; <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi> because they needed the Medicines which those Chests contained. And that (I recollect) was one of the principal reasons urged in a Commee. against the C.M.S. paying for one of those so-ordered “Medicine <hi rend="underline italic">Chests</hi>”; because the party had those very Medicines already by him.—</p>
         <p>I believe I may be allowed to say:—</p>
         <p>—That, from the very circumstance of my being farther off—not only from Medical aid, but, also, from civilized man, than any of my brethren in N. Zealand—some extra-latitude should have been allowed me.</p>
         <p>—That from the circumstances of my being placed, in, perhaps, a more unhealthy situation than some of my brethren; and, unlike them, without any other European resident to whom any of the sick Natives might occasionally apply—with a more extensive charge—some consideration should have been shown me.—</p>
         <p>—That from the circumstance of my never having (during the years in which I have been in the employ of the C.M.S.) cost the Society any actual outlay for myself, wife, or children, for <hi rend="bold">[13] </hi>Medicine, or Medical aid,—together with the known fact, that in the several serious illnesses with which it has pleased <hi rend="smallcaps">GOD </hi>to visit me since my residence here, those, <hi rend="underline italic">very medicines</hi> have been (humanly speaking) <hi rend="italic">the</hi> means of rescuing me from the brink of the grave—I can not but think the E.D. Comee. should have paused, ere they, in May, 1847, after my recovery from several attacks of serious illness,) deliberately entered such a Minute concerning a few Medicines.</p>
         <p>The VI<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>—on this Minute I have no observation to make.</p>
         <p>The sum of £<hi rend="italic">10.5.0</hi> charged under “Travelling Expenses”,—(which had been paid by me on the a/c of the C.M.S., and which had been refused payment by the E.D. Comee.) was subsequently carried to my Credit. This, therefore, will have to be deducted from the amount of £<hi rend="italic">171.14.7</hi>.,claimed by me as being still due from the C.M.S.</p>
         <p>4. I have now, my dear Sirs, written a very great deal more, on a most unwelcome and unprofitable subject, than I ever intended to do; and I hope I have now quite done with it.</p>
         <p>5. I have yet, however, somewhat more to say upon certain matters not altogether foreign to the contents of this Letter:—viz., Shipping Expenses, Travelling ditto, Medicines, and Native Teachers.—</p>
         <p>1. “Shipping Expenses”:—The E.D. Comee. have last <hi rend="bold">[14] </hi>year informed me, that the Central Comee. had resolved not to allow any more Shipping Expenses, save for articles of a Public Nature; hence, out of my bill of Shipping Expenses paid by me during that year, amounting to £<hi rend="italic">10.7.4</hi>., I was only allowed £<hi rend="italic">2.7.0</hi>. Now this, I think, is very hard; because, in our case, those Shipping Expenses arise from our out-of-the-way Station; so that we have not only the benefit of residing at “<hi rend="italic">ultima Thule</hi>”, but of paying, as it were, a tax for so doing, in the <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> and heavy <hi rend="underline italic">extra</hi> shipping expenses arising therefrom!—amounting, perhaps, at present, to from £10. to £20. per ann. It is perfectly fair that I should pay all shipping expenses on goods from England and elsewhere to their Port of Consignment in New Zealand, but certainly not their double warehousing, and double or treble Shipping coastwise to the Station.</p>
         <p>2. “Travelling Expenses”.—Last year the E.D. Comee. refused to pay for my Tent and Tarpaulins, &amp;c., saying that in future those expenses must be borne by the individual. Now, in my case, having so much more of heavy travelling than my brethren, I must necessarily need more of those articles. A Tent and Tarpaulins, with the utmost care, will scarcely serve me 2 years upon this exposed &amp; stormy line of Coast, while in a more favored situation, with less of <hi rend="italic">actual Tent Service</hi>, a tent &amp;c., may serve 5 or 6 years.</p>
         <p>3. “Medicines”.—When I sent in my Returns, &amp;c., to the E.D. Comee. in Decr. last, I, also, sent a List of a <hi rend="bold">[15] </hi>few Medicines <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi> for the Station (a copy of which I enclose). I have just got a letter from the Archdeacon, in which he says— “By the “Clara” recently from England, the Society has repeated the shipment which came by the “Louisa Campbell,” supposing the former supplies were lost. There is therefore for you a repetition of the Medicines, and under these circumstances we are not able to make out an Indent for Medicines, having more now than we can pay for.”—Now, all this is very good, but what am I to do for those Medicines which I so much need? The Rhubarb and the Jalap, the Carbonate of Soda and Cream of Tartar, the Spanish Juice and the Calaminaris, will not stand in stead of the Calomel &amp; Blue Pill, the Antimonial powder and Opium, the Sulphate &amp; Hyd of Zinc, the Quinine &amp; Emetic Tartar. These Medicines, my dear Sirs, (allow me respectfully to say,) I must have, if I am to be kept at this place; and that too with as little delay as possible. Here, where, twice a year, we are subject to epidemical visitations of Influenza, to be without a grain of Tartar Emetic? Where Marsh Fevers—of almost a Typhoid character—never fail both in spring and autumn, to be without Calomel, Quinnine, Antimonial powder and opium? Where Opthalmia is common, without a grain of Sulphate of Zinc for a wash? Where the Hooping Cough has raged, and not to have a fraction of oxyd. of Zinc? oh! I would that I was well rid of this dispensing work, but as <hi rend="bold">[16] </hi>long as I have it to attend to I must do my best. Of course, in saying (ante) “<hi rend="italic">I must have those Medicines</hi>”, I shall be understood to mean, that if the C.M.S. cannot allow them, I must even be content to pay for them myself. I will, therefore, thank you to let me have the enclosed order executed and sent out as quickly as possible, viâ Wellington.</p>
         <p>4. “Native Teachers.” Under this head I need a very considerably larger allowance for this large district than I now have. I cannot myself travel so much as I have done, and I see that great good may be effected and kept alive and growing through the agency of a few chosen N. Teachers, <hi rend="italic">as visitors</hi> to the out-villages; but they cannot be expected to wear out their few clothes in going through brake and brier without compensation. I pray you to consider this subject.—</p>
         <p>6. I proposed to the Archdeacon, and now I propose it again, that if there is not enough allowed for this District our <hi rend="italic">Stipends</hi> be mulcted, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the absolutely <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> expenses. For, in not allowing such, the work itself receives its death-blow; the active and zealous worker is paralysed; and heavy travelling will soon be brought to a close. For, although I am the person receiving the lowest stipend of any in this district (and have nothing of my own to fall back upon), I would rather have to pay back £<hi rend="italic">30</hi>. every year from my salary (if needed), than see £<hi rend="italic">10.</hi> refused for necessary Travelling <hi rend="bold">[17] </hi>expenses, or for the payment of Native Teachers, or for Medicines to benefit the Natives.</p>
         <p>7. If the Travelling and Shipping Expenses, N. Teacher’s payments, Medicines, &amp;c., &amp;c., continue as they have been to be increasingly disallowed; it will yet be a consideration with me, to petition the C.M.S to be allowed to remove to some other part of the N. Zealand Mission Field, where those heavy drawbacks are less, or where the District duties are easier.</p>
         <p>8. I hope, my dear Sirs, in your many laudable plans for Reform &amp; Retrenchment, you have not been led to retrench too much in necessary things, so as to injure the spirit of your Mission. When we alter we are all too prone to incline too much to the other side.</p>
         <p>I close this more abruptly than I could: the vessel sailing hence this evening.        May the Lord our<hi rend="smallcaps">God </hi>direct and preserve us all always, is the prayer of</p>
         <p>                                       My dear Sirs,<lb/>                              Your very humble Servant.<lb/>                                          William Colenso</p>
