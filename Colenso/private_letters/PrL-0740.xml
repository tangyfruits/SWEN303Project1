         <p rend="end">(9, p.m.)</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Your long &amp; friendly letter of the 11<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—has <hi rend="italic">filled </hi>me with sorrow! caused my cup to run over; your sudden &amp; abrupt leaving has quite unmanned me, and I know not what to say. So very unexpected too! Indeed, I have been some time looking forward to the hour of my return to Napier, to have again the pleasure of your company at nights—having also much to tell you.</p>
         <p>You begin your letter with saying— “You will probably have read in the papers of my intended departure.” <hi rend="italic">No, no, no word</hi>; not the slightest intimation!! In <hi rend="italic">what </hi>Papers was such? I know I have <hi rend="italic">not seen all</hi> the N. papers of late, mainly because of my going to Woodville once a fortnight (viz. on Saturday and returning to this place on Monday, Tuesday or even Wednesday) and as my papers from N. are left here, with letters, I often don’t see them regularly.—</p>
         <p>But, no doubt, you have <hi rend="italic">well considered </hi>the very important step you are about to take, and (tho’ sorry, aye <hi rend="italic">selfishly </hi>sorry!) I do most sincerely hope it will prove to be for the best—<hi rend="italic">in every sense</hi>. I little thought it was so very bad w. you—in the P. Office; I had <hi rend="italic">supposed </hi>you had your hands full, though not A1 as to payment, and I had been casting about to have <hi rend="italic">another</hi> pamphlet executed by you.—–.</p>
         <p>I had only just before heard of Hamilton’s leaving, and this I thought bad enough,—but this I had <hi rend="italic">expected</hi>, and so was prepared for it,—yet I did not like it.—I ought to have been with <hi rend="italic">you </hi>at this <hi rend="italic">last </hi>meeting of Society, and I think I would had I known of it <hi rend="italic">in time </hi>&amp; of your leaving. It will be a sad blow to our little Society; and <hi rend="italic">a loss to Napier</hi>, which however <hi rend="italic">she deserves. </hi>I <hi rend="underline italic">must</hi> get down before you leave,—I am <hi rend="underline italic">fixed</hi> for 2 Sundays at Woodville (15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. &amp; 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>.) after that I am free (for a time) and will go to N.—to be there, say, by 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. or 25<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., at <hi rend="italic">latest</hi>: but do send me a line to acquaint me with your movements, and if you should leave <hi rend="italic">earlier </hi>I will go down next <hi rend="italic">week purposely to see you.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I have not been quite so well this week as I was before—plenty of Rheumatism, &amp; mostly by night in bed. I was at Woodville last Sunday, &amp; the wind was very high on the Sy. Evg. insomuch that I could scarcely keep my way in going to Church—in the <hi rend="italic">extreme </hi>darkness! &amp; in returning too, being very warm from exertion, I caught cold, &amp;c, &amp;c.—However, on the whole, I have been (&amp; am) greatly favoured.—I am grieved to hear of the ailments of your little one, knowing how much such must re-act on you &amp; the mother. This week is our S.F Mail week, and I have been doubly busy; I am <hi rend="italic">tired </hi>of writing with a pain in my chest from too much stooping to write at a low table.—I note what you say <hi rend="italic">re </hi>future Rates and taxes!!! Concerning which I, too, have <hi rend="italic">many fears</hi>, but I must not allow them to disquiet me. I think I may say, that in all those matters (&amp; <hi rend="italic">many </hi>more) I wholly agree with you.—I, too, may yet leave Napier! one thing is pretty certain—that I cannot keep up <hi rend="italic">2 </hi>establishments.</p>
         <p>My dear friend—I cannot write you half of my thoughts! I am tired—I am <hi rend="italic">sad</hi>—and here I have no kind friend nor acquaintance, with whom I can reasonably &amp; freely converse.—</p>
         <p>So please excuse this. I did <hi rend="italic">not </hi>intend to write to you to-night, but I shall have no time tomorrow.</p>
         <p>With very kind regards, I am</p>
         <p>My dear Mr Harding, Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>     Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Remember me very kindly to your dear Father—&amp; to Mr. Hamilton. I enclose a clipping which came to me in a letter from S.F. What about our <hi rend="italic">Report</hi>?    W.C.</p>
