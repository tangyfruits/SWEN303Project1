         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand,<lb/>Decr. 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. 1846.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>1. It is not without some amount of diffidence that I venture to trouble you with the accompanying memorandum of an account between myself and the C.M. Society; the more so, too, because I have (I believe) hitherto invariably chose (for peace sake) rather to put up with several pecuniary losses than to refer them to the Parent Commee. I feel, however, honestly emboldened to lay this memorandum before you—from a conscientious belief that the whole will bear close investigation—from having applied again and again to the E.D. Comee. to settle the same, but in vain—from having patiently waited nearly 2 years in hopes of having it settled—and, also, from my peculiarly expensive situation in this isolated Station.—</p>
         <p>2. Having openly sent you through the E.D. Comee. the Duplicate of the original enclosed, I will not (I think) make any further remark thereupon, unless such should be hereafter called for: only, that when I found the E.D. Comee. would not sanction the outlay which I had made, I desired them to point out and set aside whatever they might consider objectionable; this, however, they also declined to do.—</p>
         <p>3. I may, notwithstanding, add, that <hi rend="underline italic">my</hi> leaving my old Station to form a new one, was a very different thing from that of Mr. Baker’s, or Rev. J. Hamlin’s, or Archd. Williams’ doing so; or (in fact) any other person’s, because, first, they had at their old stations a large quantity of Tools, &amp;c, &amp;c, and useful Stores of all kinds (which from year to year had been granted from the Society’s Kerikeri Stores), and which they brought with them, whereas, I, living at Paihia, and in a very different situation, had none of such necessary articles by me, nor yet (when my time came to leave) <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>the advantage of a Public Store to draw from. And, had I not (in some measure) foreseen what would be required and so get them in time from England, as well as been kindly favored by Rev. W.C. Dudley and other friends, the actual outlay would have been much greater than it is.—And, in reference to the reiterated remark, of “£70. being all that was thought proper to be allowed by a Comee. which was held at the Waimate in 1844,”—I would merely observe, That that Comee., formed of persons who knew nothing whatever of the place nor people, and assembled together in the Bishop’s house (I do not say resolving &amp; concluding under his direction), ought not so positively to have limited the amount of outlay; especially, too, when the total cost of the formation of each (of the <hi rend="italic">lowest</hi> of their own Stations is duly considered: which Stations of theirs were also (for the most part) formed, when both materials and labour were cheaper and more easily obtained.—</p>
         <p>4. I have mentioned, my dear Sirs,— “my peculiarly expensive situation in this isolated Station”: this I will briefly explain.—<lb/>  1. There is no Firewood upon the spot, nor near at hand. While then many of my more fortunate brethren have an abundance of this necessary article<hi rend="italic">cost free</hi> (in the woods of the C.M.S. upon their grounds), I, in perhaps the coldest Mission Station in N.Z., (where, in winter, the milk freezes in the pantry and the water in the bed room) have to buy it and that at a very dear rate. During this past winter, notwithstanding the utmost economy (often sitting cold) I have paid several pounds for Firewood alone—and the year preceding much more; independent of what drift wood has been collected by my own lads.<hi rend="bold">[3]</hi>
            <lb/>  2. There is no Water at hand fit for drinking or washing, of Clothes,—this we have to fetch in Casks from a considerable distance, at the rate of 1/- pr. Cask.<lb/>  3. From vessels not calling here but<hi rend="underline italic">very</hi> seldom, we are obliged to have a larger quantity (from 6 to 12 months stock) of articles of daily consumption—such as, Flour, Sugar, Rice, oatmeal, &amp;c.,—hence the loss occasioned by long-keeping, as well as by Rats, &amp;c., is great. In Flour alone I have lost 1400 lbs. during the 2 past years—this, however, may not happen again to such an extent.<lb/>  4. Another head of<hi rend="italic">loss </hi>arises from Goods being wetted by Salt water in landing, and this is much greater than at first sight may appear. Our harbour is 8, 9 miles distant, small and <hi rend="italic">seldom </hi>entered, vessels choosing to land, or rather drop, their goods into boats or canoes off Cape Kidnapper. By this means our better articles of clothing, especially black, has (in common with groceries, &amp;c) suffered severely; and some valuable Books (particularly a new <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia Brittann.</hi>) from England, all but ruined.<lb/>  5. Again a further<hi rend="italic">Loss </hi>is sustained, from my goods often having to be left any where upon the Coast (in consequence of foul winds); a short time since a case of Goods which I had purchased at Wellington, were opened at a Whaling Station where they had been landed and seven Blankets, &amp;c, abstracted therefrom. Owing to the length of time which necessarily intervenes before a Letter can be sent to, and an answer received from Wellington, it was some time before I could ascertain what Goods had been actually forwarded. It is but justice to mention, that the Master of the Whaling Station knew nothing whatever of what had been done by one of his men.<lb/>  6. Another Item of Loss is occasioned by my being obliged to take up my Salary in Bills on yourselves, instead of Cash; for I have to pay, firstly, a heavy<hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>Discount at Wellington to get the Bank Paper (!) for those Bills; and, secondly, a premium to get the Bank Paper converted into Cash—Paper being of no use <hi rend="italic">here</hi> among the Natives. Add to which, the certain expense and no little risk attending upon the transmission.<lb/>  7. Other memoranda of Losses may be easily gathered—from my not keeping Tobacco to pay the Natives for provisions and labour supplied (as is almost every where done to their injury);—from my heavy and constant Travelling; from having no fund nor allowance to meet the expenses attendant upon the supplying the very many sick of this large District with Flour, Sugar, tea, &amp;c,—from the Native Chiefs immediatelky about me being all Heathen, so that whenever any of the Teachers or Christian Natives from a distance come to see me (as is constantly the case) to get advice, or medicine, or for instruction, I am obliged to supply them with food, &amp;c; (The other day, to the Chiefs, Teachers, &amp; friends (Xn. Natives) who came from a great distance bringing Timber with much labour down the shallow rivers for the Churchyard Fence, &amp;c,—I gave 2 Barrels Flour and a Lot of Sugar, for they were totally without Food,—Potatoes not being yet ripe.)—from having to pay agent’s Commission upon every thing purchased at Wellington;—from my being the only European here and living moreover in the way of whites travelling to and from Wellington,—and thus subject to many unlooked-for demands upon one’s hospitality, &amp;c. &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>Had I chose to have done so, I could, I think, have advantageously referred the matter to the Bishop; but I was, and am against doing so, from principle.</p>
         <p>I have been obliged to write a great deal more than I either intended or wished, or than I have time to afford for such a subject; yet I have aimed to be as concise as possible, even to the keeping back of several things which might have been alleged in my favor.</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>my dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>Very sincerely and obediently yours</p>
         <p> William Colenso.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="underline">Report of the Rev. W. Colenso for the year ending Dec. 1847.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>During the past year I have been engaged as follows. On the Lord’s Day in holding Divine service twice, and in Catechizing &amp; teaching school. On Weekdays in attending to the Adult male schools, instructing and examining Natives, candidates fro Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, holding Bible classes &amp; teacher’s do., visiting sick and dispensing medicine, settling disputes &amp;c. &amp;c., and on Thursday evenings (and every evening when traveling lecturing and also attending to very many secular matters of the Station.—</p>
         <p>On the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. January I left the Station on a visit to the villages inland &amp; returned by way of Cape Kidnapper on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.—</p>
         <p>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of February I left the Station on a visit to Tarawera, thence to Patea by way of Taupo Lake, &amp; thence over the Ruahine mountain chain to the station, reaching home on the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. of March.— —</p>
         <p>24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of March I left the Station on a visit throughout the whole district, and on to Wellington. I returned on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. May.—</p>
         <p>On the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of June, I left the Station on a visit to Tangoio and Arapauanui villages. I returned on the 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>.</p>
         <p>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of August I again left the Station on a visit to these villages and returned on the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. September.</p>
         <p>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. September I visited the inland villages, Patangata, Waipukurau, &amp;c. returning to the Station on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. of October, I left the Station on a visit throughout the whole district, and on to Wellington, and returned on the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. November. I had also arranged for again visiting Tangoio and the other adjacent villages in Decr. but some rheumatism (from which I am still suffering) utterly prevented me.</p>
         <p>Number of Baptisms performed in the District during the year,<lb/>Adults, Men 46, Women 38, total 84. children 73. Grand total 177.</p>
         <p>Number of Marriages performed . . 70.—</p>
         <p>Number of Communicants (about) 150.</p>
         <p>Number of candidates for baptism continually augmenting.</p>
         <p>Number of Deaths unusually great being upwards of 50, in which number however it should be observed 23 persons of this place are included who were all drowned together in this Bay in the month of September last.</p>
         <p>Number of persons who have fallen into Gross Sin—alas! some in every village.</p>
         <p>Number of persons who did run well—but who now have almost, if not altogether, left us, is very considerable, particularly in and about Wellington. The <hi rend="italic">wonder</hi>, however is that there are not more, considering the fearful examples and Horrid precepts, which are hourly and voluntarily given them.</p>
         <p>Six chapels have been erected during the past year, throughout the District, 4 of which are in places where chapels were not before. Others also have been commenced.</p>
         <p>The state of the natives throughout the District is on the whole shewing some-few on whom I would fain hope the Divine Blessed Spirit hath breathed, now begin to stand out in bold relief from the heterogenous mass. and this little phalanx (the comfort of my heart) stands firm &amp; is increasing; they are still however but children &amp; need careful fostering. The public roads and works about Wellington in which several Hundreds of Natives have been employed during the past and present year, have been great means of abominable evils.</p>
         <p>Thus many have made shipwreck of their faith, more especially the poor natives of Port Nicholson, Waikanae, Otaki and the Mouth of the Manawatu River. Few however of the christian natives of the district have hitherto sought employment upon these works and of these few, some have relinquished it with disgust.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the natives immediately about us are, I am sorry to say, much as they were, “dead in trespasses and sins”. They are here tolerably quiet just now. They have lately been taught a fearful lesson in the loss of one of their five principal chiefs (Tiakitai) who with his party (23 in all) were drowned when upon a Heathen excursion. They had all been repeatedly and wonderfully warned not to go. I am happy to be able to write; I have at length succeeded in getting back the greater part of that portion of the property plundered from the U.S. Brig “Fako” which had found its way over to this side of the bay. My native teachers were of great service to me in this matter, some even bringing articles themselves (without fee or reward) from the Otaki Range, Manawatu, Taupo, &amp;c, &amp; the Christian natives too were generally very willing to deliver them up.</p>
         <p>The natives who have been fighting in and about Whanganui have made application to the Heathen Chiefs about me for aid in rum and ammunition, hitherto however they have listened to my advice and have refused to assist.—</p>
         <p>I found it no small matter to make the parties of whalers &amp; others residing on this side of Hawke’s Bay to keep the peace among themselves: and also to prevent their getting the different tribes of natives among whom they live to join them  respectively to fight and pillage each other. No doubt had I not strongly interfered they would have shed each other’s blood and caused a little disturbance in this neighbourhood. On the 2nd. August my annual teacher’s school commenced and continued daily untilthe **th inclusive. Twenty one were present from all parts of the district and all I believe wish to come again.— Most of the few Papists who were scattered throughout the district have cast away their Mariolatry and have joined us.— — Perhaps I should briefly mention there have been among the deaths a few (two in particular) the one an unbaptized little girl, a candidate for baptism, who had learned to read her New Testament during her last illness. And the other a middle aged man, a Communicant, which were attended with circumstances of a highly pleasing character. Lights there, which appeared the stronger from the gross darkness every where surrounding. We want a few such testimonials from the dark valley, they should speak volumes, they speak home, and even when the speaker is forever silent, they “yet speak”. A little sinful fragment of the happy death of a Sunday scholar in London, which I last year translated, seems to have been made of service to the natives.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Colenso has attended to the Daily female and Infant schools but the attendance of the scholars generally (including also the males) has been very irregular. Still a progress is making, several throughout the district (especially young children) having learned to read during the year. A great portion also of Mrs. Colenso’s time has been occupied in dispensing medicine and in visiting and attending to the sick.</p>
         <p>During the past winter, and on more than one occasion, we were in not a little peril through the rivers (by which we are surrounded) overflowing their banks and laying the whole Station under water. The waters rose to 8 inches over our highest floors which are nearly 2 feet from the ground and drove us to take refuge upon tables &amp;c. The mud which remained on the subsiding of the waters was frightful, being from 4 to 30 inches in depth, completely destroying all vegetation. This fearful visitation happening as it did in the beginning of winter, put almost a complete stop to all public services &amp; schools in this neighbourhood for several weeks.</p>
         <p>My own health has suffered considerably during the year—chiefly through repeated attacks of severe rheumatism, combined with low fever. I have, however, struggled hard to do my expected duty. The district is I think too large, too heavy a task for any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> to perform.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Colenso has, on the whole, enjoyed pretty good health and so have our two children, a blessing and fancy for which we would be thankful.</p>
         <p>Leonard, my principal native teacher, with others also of my N. Teachers have been active in visiting several out villages in the more distant parts of the district during the year. Particularly Tarawera—Tangoio—Te Hawera—Manawatu &amp; the scattered villages of Wairarapa.</p>
         <p>I may also add, as a cheering sign that 44 natives (i.e. eleven Teachers and Monitors, 16 other men &amp; 17 women—have during the last six months given up the beastly practice of continually smoking: all of whom were inveterate smokers. This is one of the fruits of my annual Teachers’ school. If a determined yet quiet opposition against Tobacco has not yet been tried by my Missionary brethren throughout the Archdeaconry, I would humbly venture to recommend it to their particular notice. The more so too from one well knowing that a great portion of the sin committed by the natives arises (in one way or another) from their immoderate and promiscuous use of Tobacco.</p>
