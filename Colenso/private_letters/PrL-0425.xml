         <p rend="end">Napier, Septr. 7, 1880.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I was much pleased in receiving your kind note of 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. July (though it was a long time in coming, only reaching me here on 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Augt.) to tell you the truth, I had been expecting to hear from you, if well &amp; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> too busy.—</p>
         <p>However, I should not be writing to you <hi rend="italic">today</hi>, being too busy just now,—had I not fallen-in yesterday with Dr. Buller,—and from information obtained from him I am now writing to you.</p>
         <p>Last year I received from some dark underground caves in the interior, a fine spn. of <hi rend="italic">Deinacrida</hi>, which I believe to be eyeless: it is an elegant creature, and was quite new to me (of course I know the other species). I exhibited it, with some other large insects (<hi rend="italic">Bacillus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi>, &amp;c.) at our Ordinary Inst. Meeting here in July: and now, Dr. Buller tells me, that he thinks you had also found it, (or a similar species,) or received it from Travers,—in some caves at Nelson:—therefore I now write to you, to enquire: please let me have a reply (however brief) early, and tell me what you know about it.—</p>
         <p>I have lately had some fossil teeth sent to me; all various but of Fishes: Order <hi rend="italic">Plagiotonii</hi>, fam. <hi rend="italic">Squalidæ</hi>;—found inland, all singly, yet in excellent preservation, among loose <hi rend="italic">debris</hi>. I believe them to belong to the following genera, <hi rend="italic">Carcharias, Oxyrhina, Notidanus, </hi>? <hi rend="italic">Corax,</hi>—and, possibly, of young <hi rend="italic">Lamna</hi>:—and, also, what I take to be spines of a sp. of the family of <hi rend="italic">Raiidæ</hi>,—<hi rend="italic">fine</hi> long ones with closely serrated edges. I am in hopes of being able to send them to you for further examination. How I should like to be <hi rend="italic">near</hi> to your Museum!</p>
         <p>But what I wished most particularly to say to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, was, (1) Don’t think that, because I have said “I have quite done w. the Moa,” I have nothing more to say bearing thereon for (2) I have yet a <hi rend="italic">deal more </hi>to say in my “Contributions,” <hi rend="italic">bearing in that direction</hi>,—<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. of the very <hi rend="italic">great antiquity </hi>of the Maoris in N.Z., (as you may yet see). Don’t lose sight of the little motto w. which I started,— “If this be madness, <hi rend="italic">there is method in it</hi>.”—</p>
         <p>On hastily glancing over my printed Moa papers (vol. xii.), I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> pleased w. them: I see 2 or 3 points I might have brought out stronger; and I find (<hi rend="italic">now</hi>) that I had unfortunately <hi rend="italic">omitted</hi> others, which I ought not to have done. I am also a little vexed about those 2 (miserably executed) plates! particularly as <hi rend="italic">the reason</hi> why they were so badly done is <hi rend="italic">not </hi>given. I had drawn them large size (post folio), but <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, at that time, in Tasmania,—as the Hon. Secy. Mr Gell, (Principal of the Royal Grammar School,) wrote to me, there was neither Lith. press nor printer! shortly afterwards, an “amateur and friend” was found, who tried his hand, in <hi rend="italic">reducing</hi> &amp; in <hi rend="italic">delineating</hi>: the first was done correctly enough. I had, last year, got those 2 plates copied and amended by a good artist here, at some consid. expense, (having quite lost the use of my thumb and the <hi rend="italic">drawing-powers</hi> of my hand, through <hi rend="italic">sticking</hi> at that Mao. Lexicon!)—but on showing them to Dr. Hector, he preferred to copy from those in Tasmn. Journal.</p>
         <p>I regret very much that Stack should have written <hi rend="italic">such </hi>a paper as that on the Maoris’ colour-vision! I have not yet read it <hi rend="italic">closely</hi> (having been too much disgusted with it at <hi rend="italic">first </hi>sight), but I intend to do so, and, probably, oppose it;—which, if I do, I shall not spare Stack. For my part, I wish he would cease wholly writing about the <hi rend="italic">old </hi>Maoris—he does not, he <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> understand the subject.—</p>
         <p>I am very closely engaged writing, &amp;c., for <hi rend="italic">our</hi> little Society. Atlas-like, I seem to have to bear <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the weight and to do <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the work,—<hi rend="italic">sans </hi>complaint on my part,—and yet scarcely appreciated!—</p>
         <p>You will see, that I have again written to you freely and confidentially.—</p>
         <p>Ever faithfully yours,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
