         <p rend="end">Dannevirke<lb/>May 18, 1892:<hi rend="italic">night</hi>.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Having <hi rend="italic">this </hi>day got rid of one <hi rend="italic">pressing</hi> matter (outg. Eng. Mail), &amp; having <hi rend="italic">you</hi> very much in mind of late (&amp; not lessened by a remark of your cousin R. with whom (&amp; his good lady &amp; daughter) I was a fellow-passgr. back from Woodville on My. last—your Cousin remarking that you had said—the reason you did not write to me was, that <hi rend="italic">I did not want to have to reply </hi>(or to that effect); and I told him, “Not so, but because I believed <hi rend="underline italic">you had vastly too much to do</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> to find time to write long letters to me</hi>.—There is a beg. for you! my last to you was from Napier, during my 2 days there at end of April, since that nothing from you: but that is all right, as I have heard of you from your cousin, &amp; of dear little Victor being so very much better from his good wife; but I should also say—that your cousin thought you were <hi rend="italic">not </hi>A.1. in health, and <hi rend="italic">w. me </hi>we put it down to your having too much on mind (worry &amp; work) &amp; in hand:—<hi rend="italic">Don’t, my dear Sir, burn 2 ends of the Candle</hi>! I posted to you this mg. a “Report” of our Instit. lately to hand—one of <hi rend="italic">our worst</hi>!! 2 letters (3 wks. ago) from Large &amp; G. White, asking me for <hi rend="italic">present</hi>, &amp; for <hi rend="italic">fut. </hi>papers. I replied NO—probably none this session. Hill has been here—spent 3 long nights w. me, a good chat,—like yours &amp; mine. I see by Paper, he is to write a book for schools (Govt) on “Interior N. Island”. Mrs. H. who was here w. him, was <hi rend="italic">very unwell, so altered</hi>! I recd. a copy of No.1, Polynesian Club book—have had no time to look into it, save one spot, where I see Tregear pulls me out again! Great pity that man is such a faddist! always hunting to establish sound pet notion. I suppose you know, Wills is at Makotuku, I have heard nothing of him. In “Herald” of today is a par. on the “Linotype” that astonishes me, I suppose you know even more about it. I have been to &amp; fro Woodville every week on Ch. duty, but last Saturday was a day to be remembered for rain &amp; gale<hi rend="italic">! and I exposed to it: but “Duty</hi>”———thank <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>! I escaped without cold or Rheumatism. I am wonderfully better—at last! and dare believe that this Infl. (2dy. attacks) has <hi rend="italic">served</hi>, somehow, <hi rend="italic">to lessen Rheumatism</hi>. I think I am as well in general health as can ever expect to be in this world. Have you got a copy of “Holloway’s Pills Almanac”? If not I can send you one—I have recd. 3! the views given in it of “Stately Homes of Engd.” are <hi rend="underline italic">good</hi>. I have been wkg. <hi rend="italic">hard </hi>on my Mao. Lex. <hi rend="italic">résumé </hi>&amp; have got it drafted but to do justice to both sides it <hi rend="italic">must be bulky</hi>! &amp; take <hi rend="italic">20 official letters w. replies, some very long</hi>: I have written to Capt. R. about it, &amp; next week shall send him the draft <hi rend="italic">with all those letters &amp; their ansrs</hi>—for him to see, &amp;c, <hi rend="italic">before that I copy them. </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">I should very much like for you to see the whole lot before that I proceed </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">any further. </hi>It will be a serious job for me to copy all. No doubt you will have seen a report of the doings of the Board of Reviewers in the Bay—I <hi rend="italic">don’t </hi>attend—not worth my while to run such a risk. Have managed to read “Epic of Hades” &amp; like it much; but I fancy some of his <hi rend="italic">good </hi>things in <hi rend="italic">your </hi>Ed. are <hi rend="italic">not </hi>in <hi rend="italic">this </hi>one: I wish it were a little <hi rend="italic">better </hi>printed—it ought to have been.—– I enclose payment for it w. thanks. Some new scientific works have arrived from Paris &amp; from Madrid—in Fr, &amp; in Sp.!! with letters: I must give up all<hi rend="italic"> such. </hi>Have not yet copied your letter (i.e. mine to you) but shall soon (D.V.) I suppose I may have to remain here for Wdv. work until end of June. Mr. Luff’s eldest son kindly called &amp; spent an agreeable hour w. me at Wdv. last Sunday aftern., this was his 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi> visit, he seems a nice yg. man.</p>
         <p>Now don’t trouble yourself to write to me in return, <hi rend="italic">hold on, if you are busy</hi>, &amp;c. Kindest regards to you &amp; all yours there w. you.</p>
         <p>And believe me</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p>I much wished to know how you were getting on in your business but I did not like to ask your cousin who was <hi rend="italic">very kind </hi>to me.</p>
