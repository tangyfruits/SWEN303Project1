         <p rend="end">Dannevirke,       <lb/>July 5, 1892.</p>
         <p>H.P. Cohen, Esq.,<lb/>Napier.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I returned to this place last evening from Woodville, and found yours of <hi rend="italic">30 June</hi> (with many other letters) awaiting me. As you ask for a reply “per return of post,” I may mention, your letter is post-marked— “Napier <hi rend="italic">2 July</hi>,” and. also, “Dannevirke <hi rend="italic">4 July</hi>.”—</p>
         <p>I thank you for chq. for ground rent to May 1/92, enclosed; and (in accordance with your request) herewith give my consent to your transfer of these premises to Lady Whitmore,—provided always that the conditions of the original Lease are adhered to.—</p>
         <p>I thank you much my dear Sir for your kind hopes &amp; wishes respecting myself: believing, as I do, that these are as genuine as they are hearty. I am keeping pretty well—still able to perform the Church duties at Woodville, for which alone I am remaining here in this Bush District,—notwithstanding the very wet weather— “10 days of rain in succession at Woodville,” to yesterday, &amp; rain <hi rend="italic">today</hi>.</p>
         <p>I note more deaths among us—or, rather, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> there at Napier—which I could grieve over: that of W. Black <hi rend="italic">is a severe loss to our town of Napier.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I have been <hi rend="underline italic">obliged</hi> to quit Sandell’s comfortable quarters, where we last saw each other, and to take 2 rooms at Jones’ new hotel near Railway Station.</p>
         <p>Trusting this will find you and Mrs. Cohen in good health, and that you may be spared to us and to our rising town of Napier for many years to come— I am,</p>
         <p>                                             Yours very sincerely<lb/>                                                       W. Colenso.</p>
