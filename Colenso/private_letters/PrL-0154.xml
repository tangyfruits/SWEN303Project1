         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Since I last saw you (on Saturday 8th. inst.) I have been both Considering &amp; Reconsidering what you then stated to me, about my future assisting you, in your Capacity as Chief Post-Master, in arranging with the Native Mail Carriers of this Province, at some Specified Sum pr. Annum for my Services for so Interpreting Translating &amp; Arranging When without thought, (being very busy) I said “₤10. (Ten Pounds) pr. Annum”. But, I Added “rather than do the work for that Sum I would willingly give ₤1. pr. Annum to be entirely free from it.” I have since had time for reflection and I now write Dear Sir to inform you:—</p>
         <p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. That I would very much rather have nothing at all to do with the onerous &amp; most unpleasant duty, if some suitable and convenient helper could be found. But,</p>
         <p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. That if the Genl. Government should wish me to assist you (As hitherto &amp; from the commencement of our Native Mail Service) I can only consent to do so on being in some degree paid for my Services. And that the lowest sum I would take (And then still consider myself underpaid) would be ₤30 (Say Thirty Pounds) pr. Annum. Of which I scarcely need inform you full ₤5. pr. Annum would necessarily be as heretofore given away.</p>
         <p>Further: as the Post Master General The Hon. Crosbie Ward in his late visit here both saw a specimen of what I have had to do for the General Government, (As above) and said that such Services ought to be paid for I would beg to be allowed to say that, in the Event of my being paid for the work of this year just past, the similar duties I also performed of those of the two previous years should not be forgotten.</p>
         <p>                                                             I am</p>
         <p>E. Catchpool Esqr.                           Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Chief Post Master                    Yours Faithfully</p>
         <p>Napier.              <hi rend="underline italic">Signed</hi>                 Wm. Colenso.</p>
