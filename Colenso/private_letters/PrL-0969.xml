         <p>Dear William</p>
         <p>I duly received your letter of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,—and thank you for it, also for the very nice photo and paper, that came to hand with it from your Father.</p>
         <p>I note what you say about a superior evening school about to be opened in your town, and I heartily wish it all success, and that it may be well supported by the young men of Dannevirke. You say, you will attend it, and, further, you ask me to point out to you, which of 3 subjects you have named, Algebra, Book-keeping, or Mechanical Drawing, you should study: while I highly approve of your Father’s judicious selection (those 3 named), I cannot <hi rend="italic">well </hi>point out which you should take up first, as this must in some degree depend on your present attainments, your aptitude for the <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> subject, and for your <hi rend="italic">future</hi> views: perhaps Mr Soundy together with your Father could better advise. At all events the two last named subjects could well be taken up together.—</p>
         <p>I ought to have answered this part of your letter before, but I have been, and still am, extra busy— “<hi rend="italic">new work pouring in, every day.</hi>” Kind regards</p>
         <p>Good bye. Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
