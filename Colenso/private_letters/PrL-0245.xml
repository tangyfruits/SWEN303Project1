         <p>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>On second thoughts I have run in here to write you this,—<hi rend="italic">first </hi>to apologise for <hi rend="italic">so</hi> intruding on you this morning; I did not know you were there, but having called <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> at your office <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, &amp; not finding you, and hearing, I might possibly learn somewhat of your hour of being here from your Secy. there—I went over. I should have called yesterday—but on coming here I saw such a shoal of natives’ horses outside, that I thought you were engaged, &amp; would not.—</p>
         <p>I fear I shall not be able to come down again this aftn. I feel so very Rheumatic, this damp day: so, pray do not expect me at 3 p.m.</p>
         <p>I should like to see you again, if possible, before you leave—provided you should be disengaged; and I will endeavour to call early at your office some <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> day. I wish to speak to you both on Public &amp; Private matters—but neither of very great importance.—</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Very truly yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
