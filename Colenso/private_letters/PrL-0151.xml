         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Decr. 21/60</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. McLean, </p>
         <p>I posted to your address last week a few copies (Maori) of Renata’s speech &amp; of Mr. FitzGerald’s answer.</p>
         <p>I now <hi rend="italic">enclose</hi> one—that it may not only reach you, but come under your notice. As I think Mr. FitzGerald’s answer to be a really good one &amp; well suited to the times—I would suggest that it be printed in your “Maori Messenger.” Of course I would not recommend the printing in that serial of Renata’s speech.—</p>
         <p>I feel sure you will believe that I have been for a long time anxiously noticing all <hi rend="italic">your</hi> movements at the N.—and all your sayings to, or concerning, the Natives. And am sorry, very sorry, that you have such a host of Enemies arrayed against you—especially among those who ought to know and do better.—</p>
         <p>You, I know, will be quite ready to believe—that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> lose no opportunity of aiding and assisting your views &amp; plans as to the Natives—the War—&amp; Maori King. I would that <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> here</hi> were but unanimous—I mean of those who both speak Maori &amp; have some influence among them.</p>
         <p>Could you not get me a ½ doz. copies of Karere Maori instead of a single one? For years I had 2—but of late only <hi rend="italic">one</hi>—&amp; this one, together with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> which comes for Supt.—we give away—and I am often beseiged for more. I have also been told by the Natives that they do not get them as they used to. If I could not get ½ doz. copies regularly, yet that no. or more, sent me whenever there is a defeat of the Natives, or any <hi rend="italic">good</hi> article to them, will sure to be of service.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well, &amp; with every good wish and respects.</p>
         <p>I am, </p>
         <p>Yours truly, </p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
