         <p>Waitangi<lb/>26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Sept. 1862.</p>
         <p>The Hon. The Colonial Secretary<lb/>N.Z.</p>
         <p>Sir</p>
         <p>You inform me, Sir, 1. That “the best course under all the circumstances will be that I should surrender the piece of Land in question, &amp;c.”:—and, that, “You agree to my proposal of a reference to arbitration,” and call on me to “nominate an arbitrator,” &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>2. That “two questions only will have to be determined by the arbitrators,”—the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. being,— “What amount, if any, was granted to me at any time by the Church Missionary Society towards the making of improvements on the Land while it was a Mission Station.”—</p>
         <p>In reply I have to state; (taking the last first).—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="bold">1</hi>
            <hi rend="sup bold">st</hi>
            <hi rend="bold">.</hi> That this proposed question of yours (above stated), is (as I read it) wholly a new element, placing the whole matter on an entirely different platform. A question, I fear, which, if not impossible fairly to answer, makes the settlement of the real question at issue more problematical and distant than a suit in Chancery. For,</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>The place “was a Mission Station” from A.D. 1843 to 1852 inclusive; and ceased to be such ten years ago.</item>
            <item>The very many necessary papers (being more or less vouchers) of receipt and <hi rend="underline italic">outlay</hi>, spread over the whole of that period; in the shape of a multitude of Letters, (official, semi-official, and private, to and from persons in N.Z. &amp; in England,) accounts, Bills, Invoices, Memoranda in English and in Maori, &amp;c., &amp;c. Many of which, I am almost sure, are not in existence, and cannot be forthcoming; although I had religiously preserved them up to the time of the fire (in Jany. 1853,) which destroyed the large Mission House and outhouses, and nearly all my moveable property.</item>
            <item>Could all such Papers be found, I feel assured, that no Settler at Hawke’s Bay would undertake any such arbitration, to be founded on any such documentary investigation respecting Houses and other works, of some of which, owing to fire and floods, there is absolutely no trace remaining! (and which, in all probability, would also call for the appearance of European witnesses not living in Hawke’s Bay;) such an inquiry would necessarily be a work of considerable time and expense, and could only be conducted on the spot by a skilled person sent purposely by the Government for the occasion.</item>
            <item>The fair result, however, of such inquiry, would be, my obtaining that still larger outlay repeatedly sought by me from the Church Missionary Society; but which,—after so many years of nearly fruitless endeavor,—I finally abandoned on the destruction of the then Station by fire in 1853, when, also my connexion with them ceased.</item>
            <item>But is such inquiry now really needed for the settlement of the <hi rend="italic">simple </hi>question?—of Compensation for my own private outlay and private improvements? of what, in fact, I am now called upon to leave; ten years after the place ceased to be a Mission Station! If the Government should answer this question in the affirmative, then I must respectfully decline nominating  an Arbitrator, as I feel assured no one of my acquaintance would undertake such an onerous office. Such could only be effectually filled by a Government Officer specially appointed.—</item>
         </list>
         <p>
            <hi rend="bold">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup bold">nd</hi>
            <hi rend="bold">.</hi> If, Sir, on the contrary, the Government really “agrees to my proposal,” (as I understood it)—to consider what I am equitably entitled to in surrendering the place, then I have no hesitation in naming Mr. Alexander of Napier to act as Arbitrator in my behalf.—</p>
         <p>I shall hold myself ready to obey an order from the Government to surrender the place to whomsoever they may appoint to receive the same.</p>
         <p>             I have the honor to be,<lb/>                            Sir,<lb/>       Your very humble servant<lb/>                                   William Colenso.</p>
