         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I cannot allow another Str. to leave us for your City without thanking you for your especial kindness, in writing me your <hi rend="italic">esteemed note </hi>from on board of your steamer—also for the vol. (II.) of “<hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi>” recently to hand.—I have not yet found spare time to go regularly into this Book—(only to look into Mr. Potts’ interesting Paper on our N.Z. Birds)—but intend to make it my fireside companion during our approaching long winter evenings: it appears to be more profusely adorned with illustrations than the last. I see Kirk has several papers which I cannot look into.</p>
         <p>I hope you are well. I heard of your having again started from home—<hi rend="italic">S.</hi> this time. If the St. Kilda goes to the Bounty Group—I hope you will send some one on whom you can <hi rend="italic">rely</hi> by her, as I suppose you could not go yourself.</p>
         <p>I regret to say that my hand has been very much affected for more than a month—so that I could scarcely write my name! It is again better now— “took a turn” towards good behaviour on Monday last, or I should not be able to scribble to you.</p>
         <p>When it is outrageously out of order it sadly affects my mind (spite of all my “Philosophy”!)—and then that reacts, you know how—I sometimes think it must be an anomalous phase of gout—to which my father was a long martyr!—and which I had regularly some 25 years ago. But whether or not it is an ugly Visitor, and sadly puts me out in all my writing.</p>
         <p>     Believe me always</p>
         <p>             My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>     Sincerely yours</p>
         <p>                     Wm. Colenso</p>
