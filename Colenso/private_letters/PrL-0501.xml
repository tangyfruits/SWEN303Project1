         <p rend="end">Napier May 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> 1882</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have received your note, of the 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>, &amp; thank you for it, &amp; for the specimen of Moss. My journey was not (as you suppose) a pleasant or a profitable one, (not but that I got <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, as I always manage to do,)­ but the rain spoilt it all; Out of ten days there, seven were wet, &amp; I could not leave before, owing to the Coach (which passes <hi rend="italic">this way</hi> three times a week) being <hi rend="italic">full inside</hi>, but of <hi rend="italic">what</hi>?. (Bide a wee).</p>
         <p>However, shut up there in the roadside inn, no houses near, no company, I was not idle, for there I wrote my paper which I read at the meeting, &amp; this last week I have been examining specimens, and preparing my papers (2) for our next meeting;—as I do not hear of any others doing so. The weather <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is still mild &amp; fine, (though dull &amp; cloudy &amp; rainy-look­ing this afternoon, but no wind,)—I told them inland I expected fine wea­ther throughout May—as I had generally experienced such, formerly, in tra­velling.</p>
         <p>As to the small <hi rend="italic">Astelia</hi>, I saw 100s of them,—none of course, in flower at this season, but I cannot understand why <hi rend="italic">none</hi> show any old flg or ftg stalks; however, in the <hi rend="italic">early</hi> summer (D.V) I will have a regular overhaul. I also saw several Blue Bells in flower (they flower late), some now in fl here in the paddock.</p>
         <p>I cannot make much of your Moss; it has only a few fructifications; I have seen it before, it grows in tufts, or cushions, on the dry ground; formerly it grew here, on the beaches, both sides of the town. It is but rarely found bearing good fruit.</p>
         <p>The Mosses are <hi rend="italic">very difficult</hi> to define; and generally nothing can be done with them, unless one has really good (that is) perfect specimens, as <hi rend="italic">much</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">depends</hi> on their <hi rend="italic">little</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">night cap</hi>;—whether split on one side, or more, whether hairy, painted, long, short, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>The Hepaticæ, too, are difficult, but with them, generally, the fruit perfect is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of so great consequence.</p>
         <p>I am pleased to hear of your finding (not “great spoils”;)—little wee things at your old <hi rend="italic">Pa</hi>; keep at it, bigger fish by-and-bye.</p>
         <p>I had a letter from Dr Hector who wishes to see those teeth, &amp;c, you had found, &amp; of which I had written a fair account; I shall send them to him <hi rend="italic">after</hi> our next meeting, as I shall first show them here. I had three months ago sent him those two teeth of some Mammal found at Meeanee—<hi rend="italic">first</hi>, how­ever, sending him accurate drawings, 2 of each, front &amp; side view,—but he wanted to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> them; well <hi rend="italic">now</hi> he says— “I think I told you my opinion about those two teeth you sent, do you wish to have them back”. (Good, isn’t it;) Of course he never wrote to me about them, &amp; so I have told him, a fort­night ago, but still no reply!. That Col. Museum is a perfect Maelstrom; for swallowing up specimens &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I am pretty well; hope you &amp; yours are <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> so. Keep your eye on your old Divot plants, as the spring comes on; and with very kind remembrances, </p>
         <p>Believe me Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. I also wrote 2 long letters to the D.T.—about our N.Z. Olives.<note xml:id="ftn3-143" place="foot" n="143"> The New Zealand olive. <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>.<hi rend="smallcaps"> </hi>11 &amp; 12 May <hi rend="smallcaps">1882.</hi>
            </note> I wish you, or your neighbours, took in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> paper.</p>
