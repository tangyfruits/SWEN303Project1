         <p rend="end">Auckland<lb/>Decr. 7/64.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I am very greatly gratified in receipt of your truly kind &amp; hearty letter of the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ulto. I am very glad that the 3 Cases reached you safely—and I think (sometimes—in the <hi rend="italic">midst</hi> of drier harsher matters)—how much <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will be gratified (and other lovers of Nature among you,) at seeing a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> of the specimens I have managed to send—and this is a true source of joy to me.</p>
         <p>I am also happy in finding that my essay has given <hi rend="italic">you</hi> satisfaction. I note what you say w. reference to the difficulty of tabulating names, &amp;c. I too (as, I think, I mentioned in my last note,) met with the same diffy. I <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> agree with you that it is far better to put the names of plants in column lists—rather than Continuously:—and I should have so written them, only I kept before me the limitation of “40 pps.” Since my last, it has occurred to  me, that the whole (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> Zones &amp; areas) might possibly be put into <hi rend="italic">2</hi> Tabular Lists—thus:—(prefacing each List with all the headings of the vac. Zones, or areas, in a short paragraph.)—</p>

         <p>and so on with areas. But this I merely mention—as I have not the Ms. before me; &amp; really much of its disposition has been <hi rend="italic">driven </hi>out of my mind—with subsequent and very off. work.—Politics (especially Colonial!) have as much affinity for our nat. Sciences as pea-stakes for peas;—would even that they afforded as much support!——</p>
         <p>I am glad to find, you have some of our N. <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> among you—as this strengthens my opinion as to our Bot. region. (By the way, I have just seen Seeman’s List of Fiji Isld. plants, (London, 1862,) and am again pleased in finding several of our N.Z. gen. there, &amp; some sp.—which are not (known to be) intermediate—save insular—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> at N. Isld. &amp;c.—) You say you have 3 gen.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Nesodaphne—Caltha—</hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">Davallia</hi>:—I presume; how., only <hi rend="italic">N. Tawa not N. Taraire</hi>; and I further presume that your <hi rend="italic">sp.</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Caltha </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">Davallia</hi> (seeing we have only 1 of ea. gen.) are ident. w. ours. I should say;—By all means <hi rend="italic">omit them</hi>:—strike them out, also the species:—at the same time (I think,) I have, subsy. in Ms., spoken of the <hi rend="underline italic">no</hi>. of <hi rend="italic">gen</hi>. w. sp. peculiar to the N. Isld.—therefore the <hi rend="italic">no</hi>.,—if you strike them out, will have to be altered.</p>
         <p>Further: if you have not <hi rend="italic">Nesodaphne Taraire</hi>—that sp. will have to be mentioned (in striking out the genus) among the <hi rend="italic">sp</hi>. peculiar to the N. Isld.—</p>
         <p>I venture (<hi rend="italic">pardon</hi> me) to doubt, your having <hi rend="italic">Hoheria populnea</hi>—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the truly Northern sp. (on wh. A. Cunningham founded the gen.)—I have never seen it S. of the Thames;—there are <hi rend="italic">other</hi> species—widely differing, (in app. at least,) throughout the N. Island, wh. Dr. Hooker calls <hi rend="italic">vars</hi>., &amp; on wh. we have “<hi rend="italic">fought</hi>”!—in fact one of his so-called vars. Dr. Asa Gray has made (<hi rend="italic">I think</hi>) into a genus—that, too, (described by Dr. H. as found by Raoul at <hi rend="italic">Akaroa</hi>,) I had found at Wairarapa, and sent to him at an early date, with a note, pointing out the <hi rend="italic">very differences</hi> noticed by A. Gray.</p>
         <p>(In one of Dr. H’s. late notes to me, he says,— “You will see I have restored many of your species,” &amp;c (I quote from memory).</p>
         <p>I should much like to know—by &amp; bye—if your <hi rend="italic">Hoheria </hi>is the N. Isld. plant of A. Cunn., as, if so, such is a fact worth reflecting on. The <hi rend="italic">only</hi> other sp. I feel somewhat doubtful of in your List, is <hi rend="italic">Veronica diosmæfol</hi>.; as this sp. (although I know H. gives Cook’s Straits for a 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. habitat,) I have not seen S. of the Bay of Islands—&amp; this is a striking sp. at first sight.—</p>
         <p>I shall use my influence w. Mr. Wilkinson, (&amp; perhaps you, too, will mention such to him—when you may write,) to get <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> expenses on Cases, &amp;c, (which you speak of) allowed: I am almost sure such will be done.</p>
         <p>Yesterday—I was again conversing w. our Mr Mason about the essay on the Maories:—and I was sorry to find—Dr. Shortland had done <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>—left <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>! (which, <hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi>, I suspected.) I told M.—I really could not afford to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> any more time; but (seeing some such essay was absolutely <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi>,) I would undertake it—1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. on being allowed 2 months to prepare it (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> send it on to Dunedin by M. Str. from Napier in <hi rend="italic">March</hi>): and, 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. on being paid;—either a stipulated sum, or, such a sum as you (Commissrs.) might approve of on your reading it. M. sd. he wod. see the Commsrs. <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, today, &amp; let me know. I may hear from him bef. I close this,—</p>
         <p>ADieu! may your “digestion” continue good (as the Chinese say) in the midst of your worry—you are entered on.—</p>
         <p>Ever believe me, my dear Sir, Yours truly, W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Friday 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. This mg. Mr. Mason has informed me that they wish me to write the sd. essay, &amp; will remunerate—consequently, I remain <hi rend="italic">here</hi> a week after our prorogation to collect necessary information.</p>
