         <p rend="end">Tuesday 19<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Here am I already writing to you! Last nt. or rather this mg. a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> &amp; repeated dream of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—&amp; your merciless legal examiner Lascelles!!—You (at first) suffered so much under his fire—that you fainted in Ct., was carried out &amp; brought back to witness box; long &amp; wearisome it was: the audience even disapproving, &amp; the Judge repeatedly remonstrating—the cause, <hi rend="underline italic">myself</hi>! though <hi rend="italic">what for</hi>? I don’t know. You gave L. some ugly hits, which <hi rend="italic">told</hi>, but which made him <hi rend="italic">furious</hi>. No doubt all that arose from this trial, or hearing, repeated by you in this green book!—It was a scene, &amp; a <hi rend="underline italic">hearing</hi>!!—</p>
         <p>But I should not write to you now about that <hi rend="italic">long</hi> &amp; strange dream had I not forgotten last night to pay you the enclosed: &amp; this I may say was owing to your refusal to take 10/- for 2 c. “Typo”, 1892:—for, before you came, I had determined to draw Chq. for ₤2. &amp; to pay you all (3) together. This is for 1 dozen portraits, recd., &amp; also for 3 copies of that Commission hearing. ₤1. + 9/- = ₤1.9.0.—–</p>
         <p>I <hi rend="italic">may </hi>return from Dvk. before you leave N., &amp; if so you shall hear from <hi rend="italic">&amp; see</hi> me: but if you should leave &amp; I still in Bush, just let me know <hi rend="italic">in time</hi>, of your day for passing through &amp; I will meet you—there or somewhere. I find my <hi rend="italic">last </hi>vol. of J. White, from Didsbury, is vol. V. Dinna forget “Appx to 1861”—if with you.</p>
         <p>Yours ever,  W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
