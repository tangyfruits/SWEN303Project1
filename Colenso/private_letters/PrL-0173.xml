         <p rend="end">Napier, Septr. 2/64</p>
         <p>My dear Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>I enclose a List (from memory) of a few small valued articles I should like to send to your Exhibition: if you can kindly point out <hi rend="italic">how </hi>they may be <hi rend="italic">secure </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">while</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">with</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>. I would not object to paying a small sum (if needed) for that purpose. I do not see how <hi rend="italic">private</hi> Exhibitors, being non-resident, can send any <hi rend="italic">small unique</hi> articles unless this difficulty is removed.—My present purpose is to send them by Str. in December, if I obtain a satisfactory answer. If there is any thing in the List you would not greatly care to have, please note it; and, also, tell me, if you are well found in “<hi rend="italic">Moa</hi>” Bones: as I have not many very good ones left.</p>
         <p>Perhaps it would be advisable to have a small glass-topped shew Case made here for the smaller articles.</p>
         <p>I am at work on our essay: but I fear I shall not have it quite ready by “October”—but you may depend on it by <hi rend="italic">November</hi> Mail Steamer. The hindrance (<hi rend="italic">unforeseen</hi>) has mainly arisen from our provokingly long Pl. Council Session—just 2 months! (the longest hitherto being only 3 weeks)—and partly through my not getting answers to many of my written applications N. and S. of me. Please shew the “<hi rend="italic">List</hi>” to Mr. Wm. Mason, M.G.A. to whom I have also written by this Mail. Hoping you are quite well</p>
         <p>     I am</p>
         <p>     My dear Sir</p>
         <p>     Yours truly</p>
         <p>             Wm. Colenso.</p>
