         <p rend="end">Napier, N.Z., Easter Day, <lb/>1878.</p>
         <p>A. Luff Esq.,</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>If I am to write to you at all by this mail, I must do it today—although the M. will not be closed before next Saturday. Your welcome letter of Feby. 27 (w. papers) I recd. here last week and was much pleased to find you had passed through another English winter safely. One thing in particular in your letter vexed me, viz. Witty’s not settling w. Moore, as he had promised me he would do: I hope, however he has done so before this, or at all events, will soon; as I see his Wairoa property in the market, and I suppose that is sure to sell, His house on hill is let to the Bp., &amp; his hops are, I bel., a good crop. I have heard nothing new from Black.</p>
         <p>My last to you was from Waipukurau, on 24th. March, which I hope may reach you. By that &amp; the few papers I then sent you (and which I got there) you will learn how it was w. me then: at end of March I returned to Napier, having done all that I had set myself to do, working hard every day. I came back then as it was end of quarter and no T. or other creditors, could get any money until I had exd. &amp; made out &amp; certified &amp;c. &amp;c. and, nowadays, all vouchers are scrutinised at Headquarters. I had agreed to remain in off. until 8th. inst., on that account &amp; then the Board asked me—in a nice kind of way—to remain throughout the mo., &amp; to this I have consented. The new Board (9, viz. Ormond, Sidey, W. Russell, F. Sutton, Lee, J. N. Williams, Rechab. Harding, Miss Herbert (!!) and Kenrick, the R.M. of Poverty Bay) sits on 1st. May. They will have plenty to do: may they do it rightly! I have been greatly found fault with for resigning &amp; have been asked by many old friends in town and cy. to withdraw my resn. (and in this the teachers &amp; scholars have joined almost to the unmanning of me among them) but I cannot do that. If the new B. asks me to do so, or to remain in off. I suppose I shall consent, but their doing so is doubtful. By this M. I send you several papers—in one of which you will find a good long “yard” of writing by me—in defence;<note xml:id="ftn2-319" place="foot" n="319"> The Inspectorship of Schools. <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 9 April 1878.</note> I have heard that it has taken mightily &amp; have had several letters thanking me for it. My (one) opponent “Alpha” is out again in reply,—but though Carlile<note xml:id="ftn2-320" place="foot" n="320"> WW Carlile, briefly (1877–8) editor of the <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald.</hi>
            </note> had intimated he will allow of my “answering”,<note xml:id="ftn2-321" place="foot" n="321"> “Alpha” responded in the <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 18 April 1878, and the editor added “The answer to this, if any answer comes, must close the controversy. — Ed. H.B.H.”</note> I shall not do so. My letter did “Alpha” good, as you will see. If you ask who “A” is, I do not know, but I think it is Rees the Auckland lawyer, now resident here and M.H.R. I am not at all anxious about it—I have looked, and do look (in my old-fashioned way) to a higher source.</p>
         <p>I have not yet had time to look at any of your papers, save one wh. I opened “The Financier” thinking it was a “P. World” or something of that kind—but when I saw what it was I immy. shut it up:—that &amp; war accounts—I care not, to look at. I never read anything of the war save our short telegrams, these are enough for me. I shall give this paper to Grubb who is in that line.</p>
         <p>Fear many taken in—in Arlington purchases: poor old Goodwin among them.</p>
         <p>A grand sale of land comes off there (Pov. Bay) next mo. You will see all about it in the papers. Govt. has put high reserve prices on all....</p>
         <p>P.D., poor fellow, has had a fortnight w. “my complaint” (as he calls it) viz. lumbago; he says that he “feels old age creeping over him” and he looks so, getting bald &amp; gray. Kinross is just out again, arm all tied up: I saw him 2 days ago. Heard last week of death of Bp. Selwyn! W. Russell is much better. Hamilton R. is going home shortly. You will see paper list of passengers by “Adamant”—the only one I know is Stapleton—whom you may recollect. Whitmore’s sn. in Cl. Sq. is filling in &amp; the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Masonic Hall (for the Masons no. 2) is building on the next one (Pocock’s)—an ugly building looking down on it from the hill, flattish roof, no windows this side &amp; S. end &amp; boarded close to ground! McVay has a high building (priv. res. self) erecting on part of land you leased to Tuxford;—the new road there is 30 ft. high, with hammered stone front towards sea! I thought on you when there the other day. I stood at the old corner musing!—&amp; also of Brandon’s, words (the Bk. N.Z. being torn to pieces to make great alterations to please<hi rend="italic"> new </hi>manager) B. said “Ah! they would do nothing of that kind for me!) and so, would the authorities have made that road there for you? Answer, yourself. I am told that Tuxford sold the small piece between him &amp; the Bank and the other Mall Place where his additional shop stands, for £2000 to the Bank. I notice a good front to the house putting up 2 doors beyond Morrison’s, and a house built on that piece of land you sold to Simmons of Te Kopanga, which fills that block. You will notice Joe Rhodes’ price to corporation for his 5 ac. stony hill beyond Gaol £500 pr. ac.—what think you of that? Chambers, I find, has given all his land at Tarawera to Giblin his new son-in-law with also additional there wh. Ch. had lately purchd. of some absentee—well, they want Joe Price to take it on lease, to fence all in, cut down bush, lay down to grass &amp; give it up end of 10 years: 1st 2 years £100 per ann., next 3, £300, last £600!! Mackay told L. when he served the Writ on him at Kaikoura that my land was worth at least £1000 (£8 per ac., his lease only has £4). I have heard sad news of W. Chambers at Poverty—very wild &amp; very immoral! Some 3–4 children!! a warning to parents as to over strictness (which I have always said)—a sad thorn to them, I fear.... The Harbour works are “finished” and I have not yet seen them!!... The drought has done mischief &amp; I fear may do more: the weather is delightful but no sign of rain. I told them all in March they would not get any rain in April—this being our “Indian Summer”. The stock is suffering dreadfully, Ruataniwha, Patangata, Kaikoura, Waipukurau just dry dust: how they live is a marvel....</p>
         <p>My old servants have left, new ones in. I fear I treated them too well. Our H.B.P.I. has met, on my convening. We open in May, but your old friend is again “in for it” &amp; so, I fear it will always be: we have some new members; wanted too. W. Marshall is gone to Australia—thence, perhaps to England.</p>
         <p>And now, my dear sir, adieu. May our Heavenly Father ever bless &amp; preserve you &amp; yours, is often the prayer of.</p>
         <p>Yours affy.,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p rend="end">Easter Tuesday.<lb/>April 23rd. night.</p>
         <p>By way of a P.S. I add this—at Meanee School today (walking there from McMurray’s) I find Brandon building a large addition to his house, very lofty for a single run of rooms—I counted 17 weather-boards from floor to wall plate &amp; huge windows from top to bottom: Holder has bought more land at Woodville &amp; is nearly always there now superintending.</p>
         <p>In Town the other day Lyndon was walking w. a young man. L. asked me if I knew him. I said No. It was T.H. Fitzgerald’s son! not a very fine <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> yg. man but with much of Tom’s smile.</p>
         <p>The other yg. men L. pointed out to me, fine <hi rend="italic">looking </hi>enough, but <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> (perhaps): these are 2 young Russells, from Ireland, relations of that Russell for whom Gill bought land at Porangahau. L. says they are going to settle there….</p>
         <p>Goodbye</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully, </p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
