         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I cannot allow this Mail to leave without sending you a line—now that I know you are again at Wellington. I had intended to write to you this day, ere this hour, but I have spent an agreeable afternoon, with Messrs. Woodward &amp; Knight, &amp; so have put off till <hi rend="italic">last</hi> moment.—</p>
         <p>I only knew of your return to Wellington from Dr. Eccles last week!—I had thought you were still <hi rend="italic">busy</hi> at Auckland.—</p>
         <p>I do not think I am in your debt, for letter-writing, and, if you have <hi rend="italic">any </hi>spare time, I should much like to know of your Botanical discoveries in the North.—</p>
         <p>I suppose you received my last—and you will have heard, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have the pleasure of seeing you, &amp; your Museum, (I fear I calculated too strongly on my doing so when last at Wellington,) this year—at “the gathering of the clans”—i.e. the Gen. Assy.—</p>
         <p>I informed Dr. Eccles, that I had the <hi rend="italic">Ms. </hi>of the Essay on “Maori Races” <hi rend="italic">here</hi>—having brought it away from Wellington with my numerous and heterogenous Parly. &amp; other Papers! Shall I send it to you by Post, <hi rend="underline italic">directly</hi>; or, will it do when <hi rend="underline italic">Ormond</hi> leaves for Genl. Assy.?—</p>
         <p>I have had very nice Letters from Dr. Eccles.—I hope the Essay on <hi rend="italic">Maori Races</hi> will <hi rend="underline italic">soon</hi> be printed. I wish, greatly, it were in the hands of several whom <hi rend="italic">we</hi> know.</p>
         <p>I am <hi rend="italic">very </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">hard</hi> at work on my <hi rend="italic">elementary </hi>Books, and have little of <hi rend="italic">grace </hi>(entre nous) to look for from Col. Russell. I would that Mantell were still in office! Pray remember me <hi rend="italic">most kindly</hi> to him.—</p>
         <p>I have a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter from Dr Hooker by last Mail—he says— “our plant of <hi rend="italic">Senecio rotundifolius </hi>has just died, I am sorry to say. Do send me some seeds by Post.”—This is a Southland, or Otago plant, can you do any thing for him—and <hi rend="italic">Kew</hi>?</p>
         <p>My dear Sir, do write a <hi rend="italic">line</hi>, at convenience,—</p>
         <p>and believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I fully expected you would return <hi rend="italic">by E. Coast and Napier </hi>&amp; I got out &amp; ready many things Bot. &amp; Geolog. for you to see.—My <hi rend="italic">thumb </hi>is quite done up.</p>
