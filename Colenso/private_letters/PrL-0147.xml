         <p rend="end">Waitangi,<lb/>Wednesday night, Jany. 27/58.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I have been thinking a little today on what you mentioned to me—viz.—The adoption of some plan by which the Nat. Chiefs would be satisfied &amp; allow the Settlers’ Stock to graze on their lands;—and, as it may be several days ere I may see you, and as I wish you to know early my thoughts on the subject (if of any service), lest you should, in talking with the Chiefs, hold out to them any prospect of gain, &amp;c.,—I now write to give you a few of them for your consideration.—</p>
         <p>Of course, I know very well that <hi rend="underline italic">they</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">wish</hi> some arrangement to be made by which they may gain by the grass, &amp;c. on their <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> lands;—I, however, would (for the benefit of <hi rend="italic">all</hi>) strenuously oppose it.—For,</p>
         <p>1. Such would keep back (perhaps altogether) the Sale to Govt. of these Plains:—</p>
         <p>2. Enhance their price considerably when sold.—</p>
         <p>3. Open a wide door to <hi rend="italic">their</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">taking-in</hi> Cattle (from Settlers) to graze.—</p>
         <p>4. Retard <hi rend="italic">their</hi> Civilization.</p>
         <p>5. Perhaps cause difficulties <hi rend="italic">elsewhere</hi>—as precedents of such a nature (<hi rend="italic">gain</hi>!) fly among the Natives:—such as<lb/>—Their making<hi rend="italic">reserves</hi> of grassy (Baiting) places.—<lb/>—Their making<hi rend="italic">reserves</hi> of grassy belts around proposed site of townships.—<lb/>—Their making demands for grass eaten by Travellers’ Horses, Stock in driving, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
         <p>6. All “Runs” adjoining Natives’ Ground and all Natives <hi rend="italic">Waste</hi> Land adjoining Runs should be on the “<hi rend="italic">give-&amp;-take</hi>” system: as all Natives now have stock, which is largely increasing: such has been, all along, done by Mr. Alexander.—</p>
         <p>7. No impounding should be allowed for trespass on <hi rend="italic">open waste</hi> unimproved ground—for, from the fact of half of them being idle, they would give settlers terrible annoyance.</p>
         <p>8. They themselves in travelling (often in <hi rend="italic">large</hi> parties) over Govt. grounds, or even Private property—would never pay for their Horses, &amp;c. grazing.—</p>
         <p>9. Impounding (of course) proper, in case of trespass on enclosed Lands, &amp; Cultivations—but here <hi rend="underline italic">proper</hi> fences should be imperatively required:—For such would<lb/>—Cause them to<hi rend="italic">fence well</hi>:—<lb/>—Cause them to<hi rend="italic">cease wandering</hi> from spot to spot.<lb/>—Cause them to<hi rend="italic">sell</hi> their <hi rend="italic">surplus</hi> land—<lb/>—Cause them to<hi rend="italic">abandon</hi> some of their <hi rend="italic">rapacious</hi> desires:–</p>
         <p>10. Besides, a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> sum (not even ten times the amount per head, or per acre, now paid to the Govt.) would not satisfy them:—and, if a large sum were paid, it would in all probability, be seized by <hi rend="italic">the Principal</hi> Chief;—which would (I fear) go to encourage his idleness &amp; rapacity—cause him to <hi rend="italic">encourage</hi> such stock coming about his Land; which would serve to annoy the tribe (they not gaining any of the profits) and they would, perhaps, privately injure the stock, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>11. Further—there would be no manner of justice in so acting; such being the common custom with Govt. Lands—which moreover have been paid for—while theirs cost them nothing.—</p>
         <p>12. I verily believe that the sooner they are dealt with, as if they were really and truly <hi rend="italic">British</hi> subjects, the better for them, and for their children, and for <hi rend="italic">us</hi>.—One Law, one Rule, one manner of acting for <hi rend="italic">all</hi>: at least <hi rend="italic">for all in this District</hi>—seeing how <hi rend="italic">few</hi> they are, how <hi rend="italic">well provided</hi> they are (or may be), and how <hi rend="italic">far</hi> they are advanced—some, even <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> some of our own countrymen.—</p>
         <p>Pray excuse, my dear Sir, the freedom of these few remarks—written, too, roughly.—</p>
         <p>     And believe me <lb/>      to be<lb/>            Ever very truly Yours <lb/>                     William Colenso.</p>
