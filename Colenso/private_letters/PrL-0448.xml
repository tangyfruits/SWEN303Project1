         <p rend="end">Napier, Feb 28/81</p>
         <p>Mr J. Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I had no idea until this very hour that so long a time bad elapsed since I received your last letter; which, I now find, is dated Jan 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. No doubt 2 things, at least, served to make me think it was much more recent; 1, my sending you our Annual Report (which I hope you received); and, 2, my purpose of looking in on you <hi rend="italic">before this</hi>, but in which I was disappointed,—partly by finding my 2 old rooms at Fletchers (Kaikoura) were then occupied, &amp; also that he was leaving; and partly through the very dry weather which (to say nothing of the later fires) had made the country look most uninviting (this I had from visitors there, &amp; travellers)—notwithstanding I was to have left here for Gows last Thursday, and then (owing to insolvencies; &amp; Lawyers &amp; more <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>;) obliged to be put off until <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> (Tuesday) and now that the <hi rend="italic">welcome rain</hi> has come, at last; and may continue for a few days, and so again serve to delay my visit to your locality, I have determined to write.</p>
         <p>I have again read with pleasure your last letter to hand; and first I would hope your good wife and son are safely returned to their home &amp; you at Ongaonga long before this—or you may have burnt your fingers much more easily in cooking, than in welding &amp; working your burning iron; Second, I was pleased in finding you so readily &amp; nicely agreed to my getting a copy of last years Vol for you (of Transactions N.Z.)—this, I hope will shortly be here from Wgn, when I will send it on to you.</p>
         <p>They are very busy I know at Wgn <hi rend="italic">just now</hi>—always are at this season. As you see, or take in, the “Waipawa Mail” you will have found a <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> of my writing therein; &amp; hope you will not have found it too long, or too heavy!. I was glad when I <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> it last week; what made me <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> the long job, a <hi rend="italic">little extra</hi>, was the <hi rend="italic">dreadful wretched printing</hi>; <hi rend="italic">now</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">at</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">last </hi>it is tolerably well done. I had several copies (ordered by me) but I could not send them out—besides, there were several “Printers errors”; I have been asked here, to reprint it pamphlet form. As to the letter <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Tuhiata that has been in great demand, &amp;, I hear, well received; in­deed the Editor of the Pov Bay Herald took it up, &amp; most warmly upheld it, nearly reprinting the whole of it as his leading article.<note xml:id="ftn3-83" place="foot" n="83">
               <hi rend="italic">The Poverty Bay Herald and East Coast News Letter</hi> 7 February 1881.</note> Of course, <hi rend="italic">our locals</hi> were silent.</p>
         <p>Hoping this may find you all well, &amp; that I may see you at O before long, &amp; with Kind Regards, believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W.Colenso</p>
         <p>With this I send you <hi rend="italic">one</hi> paper (which curiously enough was sent to me from Fiji;) &amp; will send you some more shortly. W.C.</p>
