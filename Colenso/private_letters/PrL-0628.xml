         <p rend="end">NAPIER TUESDAY NIGHT<lb/>JULY 13 1886</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. to hand last night, and I was glad to gee your hand writing <hi rend="italic">again</hi>—after so long a silence on your part. I had (foolishly perhaps) been expecting to get a line from you while last in Bush,—but did not; &amp; now that I am sitting down to write, (letters Home, &amp;c, &amp;c) my usual nightly occupation, I have determined <hi rend="italic">first of all</hi> to pay your debt—reply at once to your letter, and here I may say I may take up your words, and say “I have nothing new to write”—but, would such be true?. First I will notice 2 or 3 items in your letter; the green Lizard wants <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>—naturally it spends the winter months in a state of seclusion &amp; torpor; I have 2 here that have not eaten for 2 months or more.</p>
         <p>The “red fully size stems, brown, &amp;c” of our fine big-leaved Moss, were to be of the <hi rend="italic">Year</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Current</hi>, not the past,—I had thought you had more <hi rend="italic">handy</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Bairnie</hi> Mosses, which, <hi rend="italic">when ripe</hi> you could send along.</p>
         <p>No doubt you are <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> right as to the improving of the wilderness, &amp; posterity will owe <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, &amp; other early settlers more than they can ever pay; But,on the otherr hand—it would be a really good thing if <hi rend="italic">every plant</hi>—however useless or noxious, or insignificant,—could first be known, and accurately described <hi rend="italic">before</hi> it gets <hi rend="italic">polished off</hi>; for all such (animal &amp; vegetable) are <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi> to make up the unbroken chain:—that links animate &amp; inanimate nature together.—</p>
         <p>For my part I am more than ever charmed with the multitude of lovely <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ</hi>—in finding, how they dovetail into, &amp; supplement each other, but I must stop this.</p>
         <p>For my part I do not think so much of “the Eruption at Tarawera, and the numbers of people losing their lives under such fearful circumstances” (as you say),—because such, aye &amp; <hi rend="italic">far worse</hi> happen every day in shipwreck, fire, flood, cyclones, &amp; war. I believe their deaths were easy, comparatively, with those by shipwrecks &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> at meeting last night. I had reason to expect nothing (or next to it), so I staid away. I heard in town today it was a very poor affair and over by nine or so. I have 2–3 papers nearly ready which I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> send to Wgn,—that will be all one to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, if they find place in the Vol of “Trans”.</p>
         <p>I am pretty well; hope you are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> so—including young Phillip.</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I suppose you saw last year in paper—a notice of how the “Ruahine” pamphlet was reviewed in “Nature”—should you wish to see it, I can send you a copy.</p>
