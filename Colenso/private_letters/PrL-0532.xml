         <p rend="end">Norsewood Wednesday night<lb/>April 25th 1883</p>
         <p>Mr D.P.Balfour</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I was very agreeably surprised the week before last while at Matamau in receiving a kind note from you (of the 9th) containing an interesting small botanical specimen. (Curiously enough, that same mail brought me also a letter from Hamilton (Petane) containing a spn. of a small fern;—and, still more strangely was it, that up to that date of receipt by me, although several days there, &amp; the forest around me, I had not before <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> a single Botanical specimen. Your 2 kind letters being also the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> ones received by me;) Your spn is a pleasing, elegant little <hi rend="italic">Hepatica</hi>; it may be new, or it may be described in the Fl. Nov. Zel. or in the Hand Book, but to say anything really definite about it, requires more books than I have here about me. There are scores, aye hundreds, of such in the damp shaded glens, burnsides, wet cliffs, on &amp; under Mosses &amp;c., some larger, some even smaller than this, but all <hi rend="italic">Gems</hi>.</p>
         <p>Nature in the Hepaticæ of this Country has been exceedingly bountiful (so indeed, in all the Crypts, Mosses, Fungi, Lichens &amp; Algæ—not half of them (I should think) are yet known. I rarely ever come out but I find something new, of these Orders; on this vexatious &amp; unprofitable visit (26 days from N.) I have only had <hi rend="italic">one</hi> fine day in the woods; that was on Thursday last; yet I gained a very handsome species of <hi rend="italic">Aneura</hi>, in fl., quite new to me. It pleased me much (especially under all the circumstances), and I have drawn up a description of it for publication.</p>
         <p>I am doubly pleased with this last wee bairney of yours, because of your noticing it &amp; securing it, &amp;, because of your using your glass for further observing it, &amp;c., &amp;c. Send me some more by-&amp;-bye, perhaps it (&amp; others, congeners,) may flower, or be in fruit, in the winter, or early in the spring, according to exposure, shelter,wet, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I left N. on the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. March, looking forward to happy &amp; pleasant months autumnal holiday up here in the grand old forest. I remained the first week at P.Gows Waipukurau (&amp; at Waipawa—having business there), and on the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> (date of yours) came on to Matamau.</p>
         <p>It was gloomy when I started, &amp; I arrived there <hi rend="italic">in rain</hi>; it rained all that week; On Sunday (15th) it did not rain, but it was a dreadfully gloomy day,—sunless, no wind, &amp; everything wet &amp; dripping; the black withered trees all around, charred &amp; standing, added to the forbidding prospect. On the next day, Monday, the rain again began (which I had quite expected), &amp; it continued until Wednesday night. The Thursday was gloriously fine, I went away to the woods with my kit &amp; a blithesome heart, (like a bird set loose). I did a little, but not much,—the woods far too wet &amp; plashy the rule &amp; burns, still turbid &amp; overflowing. The next mg <hi rend="italic">early</hi> was also fine, &amp; I hied awa to the forest—but at XI, it began again to rain &amp; I had to trudge back in mire &amp; wet. On the Saturday (another gloomy day, no sun, no rain,) I came <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>
         <p>On Sunday aftn I walked into the neighbouring woods, &amp; it is well that I did so—for the rain again began before daylight, on Monday mg, &amp; has continued ever since; with no signs of clearing!! very dreary days indeed. Fortunately I had brought writing materials &amp; a few books &amp;c., with me, so have been busy &amp; have nearly ready a paper for our Scty.</p>
         <p>I have also gained a few small phænogams (some I had previously marked last year) from the higher &amp; drier lands, &amp; have been busy dissecting &amp; describing &amp;c., &amp;c. Still I am by no means satisfied, &amp; were it not for our <hi rend="italic">approaching</hi> term of meetings, I would not return but would remain up here in May, which I believe will prove a <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> month; formerly it was so with me, &amp; I liked it for daily foot travelling.</p>
         <p>When I came here on Saturday last, I had intended return to N. on Friday next (27th) but that cannot now well be.</p>
         <p>Tuesday, May 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. will, I think, be the day, so if you send anything to N. for me, let it be as early after that date as it may well suit you. I hope you &amp; yours are all quite well; I am pretty well (indeed I should say <hi rend="italic">very</hi> well, under the discomforts &amp; wet weather.) a little <hi rend="italic">extra</hi> daily rheumatism with (first week) earache &amp; toothache, brought on by the strong Southerly with frost at nights, while at Gow’s.</p>
         <p>I have studiously endeavoured to take things as they come—easily seeing I could not mend them,—&amp; determined, at the outset, that come what may I will not fret.</p>
         <p>Hope you will not go to sleep over this prosy epistle; Rain, rain, nothing but rain.</p>
         <p>             Believe me</p>
         <p>                             Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                                             Wm Colenso.</p>
