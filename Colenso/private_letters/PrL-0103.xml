         <p rend="end">Ch. Miss. Station,</p>
         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Feby. 27/51.</p>
         <p>Sir</p>
         <p>The bearer of this note is a young Chief of rank, who has for some time been a regular attendant upon Christian Instruction as a Candidate for Baptism.</p>
         <p>He was to have been Baptized with his mother and sisters, at the large Adult Baptism which took place here on the 9th. inst. They, however, were admitted while he was excluded.â€”</p>
         <p>This I did, in consequence of my heaving heard of his having sold you some flax shortly before, which flax he wilfully wetted on his way to your place, in order to increase its weight.</p>
         <p>He has since been to me several times, seemingly penitent for his error, and begging to be again received as a Candiate for Baptism. This, however, I have positively refused to do, unless he first makes you full recompense for the injury done; which he has willingly agreed to.</p>
         <p>I, therefore, write you this note; which he will take, and which will explain his errand. And, I should be obliged to you in your informing me, as to your being satisfied in the matter.</p>
         <p>and am,</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>very truly yours,</p>
         <p>William Colenso</p>
