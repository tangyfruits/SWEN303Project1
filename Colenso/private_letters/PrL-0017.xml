         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>It should appear that in May last, Mr Mair chartered a small Vessel to go a Trading to the Bay of Plenty placing a younger man (whose name is J.W. Fedarb) on board as trading master. This Vessel touched at Tauranga, and Fedarb was furnished by Mr Stack (one of our Missionaries) with a copy of the Treaty and instructions to get as many signatures from the chiefs, at the places at which he should touch, as he possibly could. He, accordingly, copied the Treaty, and has got it signed by several, as Your Excellency will perceive by the enclosed Document.—At Opotiki the chiefs, who are well-disposed towards us, the Prot. Misss., wished him to make a distinction bet. them &amp; those who had made a profession of adherence to the R.C. Bp.—wh. he did by prefixing a  before their names: there were four names so prefixed, but one, aftds, begged to have the mark erased, as he wod. belg. to them no longer. I mentn. this as accounting for the erasure in the document.</p>
         <p>It shod. also appear, my dear Sir, that Mr Stack had desired Fedarb to give them a little Tobacco, &amp;c, which he has done from the stores he had in chge. the property of Mr Mair. The Bill for which I enclose—</p>
         <p>Fedarb was once in my employ; this accounts for his bringing <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the Documents &amp;c.—wh. I now have the honour to transmit to Yr. Excellency.</p>
         <p>Hoping that Yr. Excellency enjoys good health, and praying for a cont. of the same</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>My dr Sir</p>
         <p>Yr mo ob servt</p>
         <p>WC</p>
