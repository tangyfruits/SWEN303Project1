         <p rend="end">(midnight.)</p>
         <p>My dear Sir Donald McLean,</p>
         <p>In sending you the Mss. you wished for—of <hi rend="italic">both </hi>parts of the Dicty.,—and my long letter or <hi rend="italic">resumé</hi>,—I can only hope you may find time to give them (the <hi rend="italic">latter </hi>particularly) some little attention. I know that you are and must be busy. You will see that I have (<hi rend="italic">painfully</hi>) worked up from the very beginning of the Dicty. such portion (with I. O. Ka, and the other <hi rend="italic">particles</hi>) being by far the hardest part of the Work—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> to do it well &amp; fairly: which <hi rend="italic">I feel I have not yet accomplished.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The pages that will follow will contain a verb or two taken from under some consonant in the latter part of the Dy.—</p>
         <p>You may remember, that some time back you requested me to give “good Maori <hi rend="italic">examples</hi>,”—you will find plenty given! Of course, by-and-bye, (should the Dy. ever be printed,) some of the examples may be omitted.</p>
         <p>You have also, officially, asked me for “some <hi rend="italic">proposal</hi>” concerning the Work. Well, you will find 4 given in my letter, to which I have already called your close attention.</p>
         <p>I fancy <hi rend="italic">you </hi>will endorse my remarks, &amp;c. under the word <hi rend="italic">Atua.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Please let Mr. Ormond see all my Mss. I hope you will get my official letter (<hi rend="italic">resumé</hi>!) printed with the pages.—</p>
         <p>I fear I cannot now write to your Printer about them.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are <hi rend="italic">quite </hi>well &amp; strong,—&amp; wishing you health &amp; strength, &amp;c, &amp;c during the whole session,</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>my dear Sir Donald,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
