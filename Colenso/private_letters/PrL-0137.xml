         <p rend="end">New Zealand, Jany. 3, 1854</p>
         <p>Major Hector Straith,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>1.Your letter of the <hi rend="italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">nd</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> June</hi> 1853 reached me here last month; and very very sorry am I to have had such a communication from you.</p>
         <p>2. I had previously been appraised by Archdn. W. Williams, as well as by Mr. Vidal, of the decision of the Parent Committee respecting me: for which, I confess, I was utterly unprepared. Now, however, that I have received your Official Letter I cannot delay acknowledging it.</p>
         <p>3. Perhaps, under all circumstances; I had better not <hi rend="underline italic">say</hi> anything more (if I have not said too much already); than to express my great grief at the steps the Parent Commee. have taken in dissolving their connexion with me, and to inform you, that I have no present intention of leaving this District.—</p>
         <p>4. My future movements of every kind will, I trust, be wholly <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>directed by Him who has promised never to leave never to forsake, and who changeth not. I still trust to experience (with David), that when my father &amp; mother forsake me there is One, who will take me up. I only wish to be as a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> child before Him. I hope now to cease from looking to man: this, however, is a hard lesson.</p>
         <p>5. I little thought that I should thus end—or, rather, that you (whom I have faithfully served,) could thus cut me adrift—to want, it may be, in my old years. Perhaps I have trusted even the C.M.Society too much: Time with shew.</p>
         <p>6. You request me, Sir, to “aid” my flock “in placing themselves quietly under <hi rend="italic">any</hi> spiritual guide that may supply my place.” Can I conscientiously do this? I trust, sinner though I am, that I never have been, and am not a hireling: <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> will be done; with respect to both myself &amp; my flock. His counsel shall stand.—</p>
         <p>7. Believing, as I do, that the Commee. have acted wrongly in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> matter towards both me and my people; I cannot <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>but believe, that the great Head of the Church will, sooner or later, (if I am right) shew them their error: may He do so gently yet convincingly.</p>
         <p>8. I have yet a small portion of my Journal (which is your rightful due) to copy; this I hope to do very shortly; which will, I suppose, close my writing to and for you.</p>
         <p>9. I enclose copies of my Letters to Archdn. W. Williams &amp; Mr. Vidal; I do this, not because they can now be desired by you, but because I have hitherto sent you copies of all Letters I have written respecting this sad affair, and these will (I both suppose &amp; hope) quite close my writing upon the same—and may be of some service hereafter.—</p>
         <p>10. I can never cease to pray for the C.M.S—both in their work at home and abroad. I have eaten their bread for nearly 20 years. May our gracious <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> and Master abundantly bless you—all! Remember me ever, my dear Sir, in your prayers, and believe me, to be</p>
         <p>Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>(unfortunate yet still attached)</p>

         </p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>On Saturday last the 26<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> inst., I received your Letter of the 24<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> ulto. and, although I have not yet received the original Letter from Major Straith, to which you refer, yet as I have had a copy thereof sent me from Archdeacon W. Williams, and as the Messenger who brought it returns immediately—I hasten to reply to your Letter.—</p>
         <p>The C.M. Society having been pleased (most unexpectedly to me) to dissolve their connexion with me, I, consequently cannot consent to return to <hi rend="italic">England</hi>. Neither do I propose (for the present, at least,) to remove from this district.</p>
         <p>Had they simply recalled me (although even such a separation from my people would be painful) I should have considered it to be my duty to obey their order.</p>
         <p>If it be indeed (as you say) “absolutely necessary for the cause of Xt. that I should quit N. Zealand,” and that “without delay”:—then <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi>
            <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>who sent me to this land,—who has all power in heaven &amp; in earth,—and to whom all judgment hath been committed—will assuredly remove me from it.</p>
         <p>I have also to acknowledge a Letter, which I received from you a short time ago (viz. on the 10<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of August.) addressed to me as a Layman; dated March 12/53, and enclosing an extract from the Minutes of Central Commee. held at Auckland on the 2<hi rend="sup">nd.</hi> of that month.—I am not aware of this Letter now requiring any specific answer.—</p>
         <p>And, thanking you for your “very sincere sympathies” so kindly expressed—(the first I have had from any of the C.M. body in N. Zealand)—I am,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir, </p>
         <p>Very faithfully Yours</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Mr. Archdn. W. Williams, in sending me a memo. of my a/c. debits me with “<hi rend="italic">Books, £2.6.0</hi>”: and, in a note, adds,—“there is a parcel of Books now in Mr Vidal’s store, which are possibly the Books here charged.” If so, please send them to my Agents at Wellington, Messrs. Bethune &amp; Hunter, as I know nothing of the Books with which I am debited.               W.C.</p>

         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Decr. 29,</p>
         <p rend="end">1853.</p>
         <p>Ven. Archdeacon W. Williams,</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>1.In answering your letter of the 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> ulto. (which I did on the 28<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> ulto., and which I was obliged to do in a more hurried way than I could have wished,) I omitted a sentence, or paragraph, which I have since thought, I ought to have inserted. And, as I believe it to be of some little import, (if not to the C.M.S., at all events to myself,) and as I suppose, that you will, as usual, attend the Central Commee., I now take upon myself to write it to you, for your, and their, information.—</p>
         <p>2. The sentence, which I think I should have written, and which should have place amongst the few reasons I gave you for my still remaining on this spot, is as follows:<lb/>—That, I have heard from respectable European authority, that, in case the Waitangi Mission Station should be abandoned by the C.M.S., or another site be given them by the Natives<hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>for a Mission Station, the C.M.S. could not (or, would not) be allowed by the Government to have any claim to the spot of Land at Waitangi.—</p>
         <p>3. Now, Sir, if such be the case, (and, in your going to Auckland you can enquire fully, and satisfy yourself,) it appears to me (and perhaps to others) very plain, that no one—not even the natives who <hi rend="italic">were</hi> once the proprietors,—can advance such a right, or claim, to be heard &amp; considered, as myself—who have both expended<note xml:id="ftn2-29" place="foot" n="29"> WC: <hi rend="italic">Exclusive </hi>of<hi rend="italic"> </hi>the sum of<hi rend="italic"> </hi>£95 allowed by Major Straith in his Letter of August <hi rend="italic">[</hi>**<hi rend="italic">]</hi> as will appear from documents formerly sent to the E.D. Commee.</note> and labored much upon the spot, as well as lost greatly through the calamitous fire of last year. A claim which, I venture to think, would, if advanced, be allowed.—At all events, we well know, that by the Colonial Ordinance, all residents—even squatters of the very lowest grade—are allowed to have the first right to purchase their homesteads.—</p>
         <p>4. I trust, Sir, that you will quite believe, that in my writing I am not actuated by any desire to establish a claim to Waitangi <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>against the right of the C.M.S.; (far, very far be such a thought from me;) but, rather, that, if what I have heard and stated be correct, I may (at least) be allowed to advance it as a claim to be considered for my present residence.</p>
         <p>I should have written to you before but I lacked opportunity, and even now I am without one.</p>
         <p>And am,</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>William Colenso</p>
         <p rend="end">
            <hi rend="bold">[1] </hi>Waitangi,</p>
         <p rend="end">Monday Morng., Novr. 28,</p>
         <p rend="end">1853.</p>
         <p>Ven. Archdn. Williams,</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>Your Letter of the 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> inst.,—covering a copy of a Letter from Major Straith of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd.</hi> June 1853, and a memo. of a/c between the C.M.S. &amp; myself—reached me here on Saturday night last. And as the messenger is returning immediately to Te Wairoa, I hasten to reply thereto: which, however, I shall be necessitated to do in a very concise and rough way.</p>
         <p>I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet received the original of Major Straith’s Letter.</p>
         <p>I am exceedingly surprised at the Resolution of the Parent Commee.; for which, I confess, I was totally unprepared.</p>
         <p>I wholly decline their proposal of returning to England; as I cannot see such to be my path of duty.</p>
         <p>Had the CMS. merely recalled me home, (although even for this step I should also have been unprepared) I should consider it to be my duty to obey.</p>
         <p>I have no present intention of removing from this district. Of course <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> say I shall not remove from this spot.—Notwithstanding, I still adhere to my original views, that (even for you all who now wish me away) I am better left quietly here for a season. Otherwise I must necessarily purchase Land ere I can remove, which will, of course firmly fix me—and that perhaps (seeing there is not at present much choice) where you may also consider me to be much more in the way.</p>
         <p>As a matter of course, now that the Society have dissolved their connexion with me, I could not wish to remain a moment on this their ground (I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> say “<hi rend="italic">their</hi> premises”); had it not been for (among other) the following reasons.—</p>
         <p>1. The loss of the dwelling-house by fire, and the certainty that another will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be erected on this ground.</p>
         <p>2. Its present isolated situation, the Natives having removed from Te Awapuni and other neighbouring villages.</p>
         <p>3. My having obtained for them (the CMS.) a good &amp; highly suitable site for a M. Station.</p>
         <p>4. The present buildings (the store excepted) not yet having been in any way paid for by the Society.—</p>
         <p>5. My having several <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> &amp; cumbrous articles,—which, though private property, were certainly had for the benefit of the <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>Mission Cause &amp; Natives:—such as, Printing Press,—Type in Cases &amp; Boxes—Printing Materials—Binding Presses and Binding Material; Printing paper, several hundred weight, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>5. The impossibility of my being able to remove—even if again “requested” to do so—until I should get a proper house erected.</p>
         <p>6. Every thing being more or less the work of my own hands.—</p>
         <p>7. My long Service.</p>
         <p>8. (and last, though not the least). The Settlers about me, who are mostly Presbyterian, know the truth of what I have here stated;—many of them were much opposed to me (not however originally, on account of my sad fall), some of them now begin to look upon me as a <hi rend="italic">persecuted</hi> person; and a very little more of severity would fully establish that belief; and which, I know, would act greatly against the interests of the Protestant Episcopal Mission in these parts.—</p>
         <p>I cannot now speak as to the correctness or not of the memo. of a/c. which you have furnished. 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. as to <hi rend="italic">debit</hi>, £32.6.0;—all my necessary papers from CMS., having been long ago sent to the Secy. E.D. Commee. (Mr. Baker) for his inspection; who, I believe, passed them <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>on to Mr. Barker; I have subsequently applied <hi rend="underline italic">twice</hi> for them, but in vain:—2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. As to <hi rend="italic">credit</hi>; the travelling expenses in that year (’52), were £39.17.0, as per a/c. rendered, (being increased through the Bishop’s visit,) of which you have only allowed me £23.8.9!—</p>
         <p>I should have thought that my heavy losses through fire (not to mention many other extra expenses incurred of late,) would rather have called forth your pecuniary sympathies.—</p>
         <p>I do not recollect having ever written a Letter to Mr. Fairburn concerning my error, to which you have particularly alluded. I gave his son John a long &amp; faithful relation of the sad affair; and, on the busy night of his leaving with the children, I hastily wrote down a few heads of enquiry to his father, whom I was <hi rend="italic">then</hi> led to believe would (as a matter of course) prove a friend; that paper I then submitted both to Mr. John Fairburn &amp; to his sister, and they did not in any way disapprove of it. Such cannot, I think, be justly called a Letter; such ought not, I presume, to be urged against me.</p>
         <p>I wrote Letters to—Rev. J Hamlin, Mr. Baker, &amp; Mr. Puckey, in answer <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>to letters from them upon the sad matter; to all that I have said in those Letters I am prepared to stand to; always excepting any peculiarly warm or superlative expression, which may have arisen from injured or excited feelings.—I am not aware of my having written to any other persons N. of me—the Bp. excepted.</p>
         <p>You do not, Sir, know the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> matter, nor is it likely that you (or any one in these islands) ever will. Perhaps had you been at Turanga, I should have <hi rend="italic">first</hi> applied to you, and things might have been different—at least in reference to your and others opinion of me.—</p>
         <p>You know well the vast difference which even a <hi rend="italic">suppressio veri</hi>
            <note xml:id="ftn2-30" place="foot" n="30"> Suppression of the truth.</note> makes in a story, how much more than a <hi rend="italic">suggestio falsi!</hi>
            <note xml:id="ftn2-31" place="foot" n="31">Suggestion of something that is untrue.</note> but when both of these exist, and are also viewed through the colored glasses, or a lens of high power, the alteration and distortion are immense.—</p>
         <p>You tell me, Sir, that I have sinned “grievously against <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>”:—I knew this long ago, long before I wrote to the Bishop—long before any one here (save ourselves, the persons immediately concerned,) knew anything of the matter. I have <hi rend="italic">never said to the contrary</hi>. <hi rend="bold">[6]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>You, also, tell me of my “indifference &amp; insensibility” to this grievous sin. Here is another sad proof of an error of judgment on your part.—I indifferent! insensible!! <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, Sir, knows to the contrary: my many many bitter nights and days of weeping and praying tell me another tale. If I had £10,000 I would gladly give it—Yea, to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> very last farthing—not to have so foolishly transgressed. And since, I have done <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that has been in my power (as far as I have seen) towards counteracting it.</p>
         <p>At the same time, I confess, that I have not magnified my sin—either in the abstract, or in its attendant circumstances,—or in its consequences,—as some have done. That many evils have since sprung up, and that many more will follow, is true; but, <hi rend="underline italic">I am not to be charged with these</hi>. For, on the contrary, I believe, that I could still have safely steered my bark through all the shoals &amp; dangers, as hitherto, (saving my charge, though losing myself,) had it been left to me; but the helm was injudiously torn from my hand; hence these numerous evils. Mr. McLean truly enough remarked to me the other day,— “Your people, Mr. Colenso, <hi rend="italic">were</hi> in good <hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>order”—(but why go so far, when the Bishop had told me the same?). That they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, is not to be attributed to me; rather to the Bishop’s ill-judged (not <hi rend="italic">illegal</hi>) suspension. Had I <hi rend="italic">then</hi> left them (as then, too, unfed!!!) sure enough I am, that many of them would have joined the Papists; and what a shock would have been caused throughout N.Z.! Through my remaining, however, <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">one</hi> has joined them. To <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> be all praise.</p>
         <p>You <hi rend="italic">may</hi> ask, Why I wish to remain here (in this neighbourhood) <hi rend="italic">sans</hi> comfort? I wait, sir, my Master’s pleasure; to see, perhaps, his vindication of His poor &amp; despised &amp; much-injured servant; <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, mind, His approval of sin. Let this, for the time, be sufficient.</p>
         <p>I have had plenty of proof as to my mission; I have them now; some, however, are gone before. I am quite satisfied on this head; others will be by-and-bye. Justice will be done me.</p>
         <p>I am alone, as to man; from whom I have had <hi rend="italic">no</hi> help. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> have deserted me. I am sorry, truly sorry, that you too should be among the number. Yet it is natural that you should,<hi rend="smallcaps"> if</hi> you could believe <hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>all you heard. Still, such is not ordinarily the case; the worst have some friend or relation to stand by them; but in this I have been made to be like my Master; and <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> has graciously afforded strength. How true it is, that adversity tries both love and friendship! Notwithstanding, I believe you to be Servants of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>: but, oh! if <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> were to deal with you as you (all) have dealt with me!!</p>
         <p>It cannot be denied that every one of you has acted in the most severe and rigorous manner towards me. To prove this, it has only to be asked, what more could you have done?</p>
         <p>I did not intend to say so much: I now stop. I hope I shall not have offended you in the freeness of my unpolished remarks; I do not wish to do so.—</p>
         <p>It remains with you to send or not the sum so long due to me from the CMS.—Some for wages hardly-earned, some for monies paid out<hi rend="italic">. I do not intend to ask for it</hi>. I regret exceedingly that I have been obliged to use one of the Bills originally drawn for Building purposes; this I have very lately done much against my will.<note xml:id="ftn2-32" place="foot" n="32">WC: This, however <hi rend="italic">has been debited against me</hi> in the memo. of a/c. forwarded by the Archd.</note> I have wanted, of late; (of course, owing to the disastrous fire;) I may, very likely, again want; if <hi rend="bold">[9] </hi>needful for me, I shall. But, I have been repeatedly taught to cease from man; may I remember this Lesson.—</p>
         <p>For many years we (<hi rend="italic">taua,</hi>
            <note xml:id="ftn2-33" place="foot" n="33">WC: <hi rend="italic">taua</hi>—Thou &amp; I: dual.</note> particularly,) have gone on together. We are now separated, but we shall meet again. So act, my dear Sir, as to have no misgivings at that meeting. I love you and your work as much as ever, and shall (while I live) never cease to pray for both. Continue, also, to offer up your prayers for me, I need them, much.—</p>
         <p>May <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> bless and prosper You! And, if it pleases Him, may <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> give you to be one of the first to do justice to His deeply injured though most unworthy Servant,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. There must certainly have been some Ch. Missy. Publications sent me, as usual, prior to the date of Major Straith’s Letter; (I have had none now for nearly two years;) these, I think, should not be withheld from me. W.C.</p>
