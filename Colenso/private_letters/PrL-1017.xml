         <p rend="end">Napier, Oct. 20th., 1897.</p>
         <p>Mr W. Gordon,<lb/>New Plymouth.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I will now endeavour to answer yours of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst.—</p>
         <p>You enquire (1.) <hi rend="italic">re </hi>derivation of “Ohinemutu”. This seems to me simple (just as you have it): “of Hinemutu, the latter being a girl’s name”. Hine<hi rend="italic">mu</hi>tu probably meaning the “<hi rend="italic">last</hi>, or youngest daughter”: not unlikely, however, possessing something additional (understood) of a family or tribal nature. (2.) <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the name given to the Ass = “<hi rend="italic">Kaihe</hi>”, (which you seriously supposed to have been given to the donkey through it being fed on hay”!) I am inclined to believe it was from its <hi rend="italic">common</hi> name “Jackass”, the first 3 letters being dropped. and the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., k, tacked onto the ass,—the word, according to the Maori language, must terminate in a vowel, the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> here being very <hi rend="italic">short</hi> in pronunciation. The proper monosyllabic name of the animal—<hi rend="italic">ass</hi>, could not be clearly coined in Maori. A common term for <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> = hay, is <hi rend="italic">karaihe</hi>, a very different word: this, however, is <hi rend="italic">not needed</hi>, there being proper Maori terms for grass.—3. The term “<hi rend="italic">Mihinare</hi>” for the wild briar, you heard at Rotorua, no doubt is from the plant sweet-briar, having been introduced there by the Revd. T. Chapman, in his garden, (one of our <hi rend="italic">early </hi>Missionaries stationed there): or, possibly, in its present wild and <hi rend="italic">injurious </hi>state, the name given to it derisionly by the Roman Catholics, always his foes.</p>
         <p>In all translations into barbarous and little-known languages—especially names of things, &amp;c., utterly unknown, there must necessarily be an introduction of <hi rend="italic">new </hi>words, coined or fabricated for the purpose. This, however, should be very carefully done, and only adopted, as a “<hi rend="italic">dernier resort</hi>”, after mature consideration. It has long been a source of great grief to me, to see how the proper copious &amp; euphonious Maori language has been and is broken-up and superseded by unneeded unmeaning and vicious introduction of new words (<hi rend="italic">gibberish</hi>!)—especially by translators &amp; interpreters (so called!) in the Government Service! Pure Maori is scarcely now spoken (is it known?) among the Maoris themselves. I have not unfrequently had to say to a Maori— “Speak Maori, and I shall understand you”.——</p>
         <p>You tell me, you wish for a few lines from me respecting your former work, viz.—display of Maori Patterns, &amp;c., around the L. Prayer in Maori: to place in your album. I will therefore give them in a separate note; though I think I had fully done so a few years ago in my letter to you concerning the same.</p>
         <p>Any enquiry similar to those you have made, namely, the early “<hi rend="italic">coining</hi>” of words for things <hi rend="italic">new </hi>to the Maori, I will endeavor to answer—though my spare time <hi rend="underline italic">now</hi> (with disabled right hand and arm) is but little. I am, Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S.</p>
         <p>In looking at your photo, L.P. this day, I find it is sadly faded, scarcely legible in some places: the 4 sq. corners in particular of the inner large border are <hi rend="italic">totally blank.</hi>
