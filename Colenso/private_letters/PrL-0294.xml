         <p rend="end">Napier,</p>
         <p rend="end">Sunday, July</p>
         <p rend="end">25: midnight.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir Donald McLean,</p>
         <p>Just at XII have I finished writing! for 3 successive days and <hi rend="italic">long</hi> nights (each until mg.) have I been <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> at work not even over the door-step, &amp; without dinner! I <hi rend="underline italic">am tired</hi>.</p>
         <p>I received your telegram and replied briefly, and I hope you have received what I sent per “Luna” all right. I now send you a little more:—(1.) of the Maori-Eng; just a couple of the heavy root verbs, (that those who know nothing of our N.Z. tongue, may <hi rend="italic">see</hi> what amounts of work there is!)—and, (2) a few pages of the Eng.-Maori part, just enough to make (I suppose) <hi rend="italic">2 pages</hi> of the Specimen Sheet, which I hope you will get <hi rend="italic">printed</hi>: (should a little more be required) to make up 2 pages, you can take it from what I have already sent you—the <hi rend="italic">Eng-Maori</hi> parts.)</p>
         <p>You informed me, that some Member had already tabled a Motion <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the Dy.! He seems (if I may say so) to be in a hurry. I hope you will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> reply, until you have what I sent you all ready (with this also) <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> to lay on Table: or, that you will request him, to hold on a bit: but there you know best.</p>
         <p>Now I have just copied all in the rough from my Mss. I may add, that, if ever completed and printed,—(1.) It will not, of course, be so diffuse as you now have it: (2.) It must be first settled, whether <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> in some words—as taaua, maaua, maaku, &amp;c.—or ā: (3.) It must also be settled, whether the N.Z. alphabet shall run as <hi rend="italic">I have it</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">all</hi> vowels, A,E,I,O,U, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, and then the consonants,—as the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Polynesian dialects have it, and as ours <hi rend="italic">formerly</hi> had it,)—or whether it shall run—A, E, H, I, K &amp;c.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir Donald—You will be too busy to write, but I shall be thinking of you, often.</p>
         <p>I hope your health will be <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, first rate; and I heartily wish you well through all the heavy duties of the Session,</p>
         <p>Believe me to be, </p>
         <p>     Yours very truly, <lb/>         W. Colenso</p>
      </body>
