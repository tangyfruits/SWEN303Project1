         <p>To the Pokonao,<lb/>To Leonard Kawepo.</p>
         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Monday night<lb/>January 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1850</p>
         <p>O Sir,</p>
         <p>O Leonard, greeting to thee, my love to thee is great. Yes, indeed, O Sir, true is my saying, here am I sorrowing for thee; here am I concerned for thee. If I had no love for thee, thou wouldst not at this time see my writing, neither should I be sorry or concerned for thee. Notwithstanding, Sir, I did not exactly know this morning what I should say to thee; I have indeed considered deeply, and now at length my mind is fixed. On my praying just now for thee that thou mightest be spared &amp; be brought back into the right path; yes, it was then, O friend, on my remembering the word of our Lord which I read at morning prayer this day: (viz.) Matthew <hi rend="smallcaps">v</hi>. 42.</p>
         <p>O Sir, O Leonard Kawepo, greeting to thee, that is to say to that Leonard who came with me from the Bay of Islands, to that Leonard I now write. O Sir, alas! greeting to thee. May God direct and teach me; as that my writing to thee may be correct.—</p>
         <p>Behold, O Sir: Alas! we must be separated. Now immediately I will cease thy word of being Teacher now thine heart be dark without cause at this word. Say not, “This thing is done suddenly”; or “done in a hurry”; or “no one knows what this is for”. O Sir, not so. For a long period have my thoughts wrought within me that thou shouldest sit still, ever since the other year, even 1848 while Mr. Kier was still here; at that time it was that my thoughts &amp; thy actions began to (degenerate?). But, O Sir, it was but a little then at the first commencement of thy starting aside; yet it has long ago been perceived by us, that is, by all of us, and we have all felt much concerned on thy account. Yes, I bore long (with thee) I said in my heart, that thou wouldest surely see thy own degeneracy, &amp; that thou wouldest then return. </p>
         <p>But, not so. Then I thought, when Hirini Tarahawaiki comes (here, to remain as teacher,) then perhaps; or at the time perhaps when I should remove inland to the Waitaurakai; yes, even thus O Sir, was it within me. Nevertheless, that thou mayest not say that this word of mine is untrue, let me now remind thee of the numerous admonitions I gave thee in the year which is just passed. Did I not O friend, remind thee privately, of the numerous things which were said by the people concerning thee? yes, &amp; of thy growing apathy towards School and prayers,—of thy never once visiting any of the numerous sick, although close to thee at thy own village,—of thy approaching more &amp; more towards heathenish ideas, with regard to land, to women, to chiefs, to trading, and to many other things—(also with regard) to thy continually keeping thyself aloof and out of the sight of me thy Minister, thou didst never come near me unless expressly sent for. And, with regard to these likewise, (which I now for the first time mention to thee,) viz., the altered and unprofitable nature of thy sermons on the Sabbath-days; and the altered and unprofitable nature of thy prayers on Prayer-meeting evenings, (this was the principal thing in which I detected (the declension of) my friend, and I felt grieved for thee,) and, certain of my native teachers likewise spoke to me concerning thee, grieving on thy account, and saying, Alas! how much altered for the worse, is the manner, and the talk, and the style of writing of Leonard; and, thy word to me likewise at our last conversation, thou didst say, that, “Thou didst not understand the meaning of the Chapters so as to explain them in class.”—</p>
         <p>Now, O friend, it is not that thou mayest be completely cut up, that I write these things to thee, not so indeed; but rather, this is a true thing to destroy the natural heart which is continually striving and searching for something whereby to excuse itself. Therefore it is that I give thee these little promptings of admonition. In asmuch as I consider,—that the conscience of my friend, who accompanied me from the North, is not yet perhaps utterly destroyed.</p>
         <p>O Sir, O Leonard, thou wast a different man formerly. Yes, thy conversation was pleasant to me; thy prayers were good; thy ways were correct; at the period when thou wast spoken against by the many, but, wast praised and kindly treated by his Minister. But as for this, the fine gold is become tarnished, and that which was light within thee is become darkness! And for this reason, formerly thou didst not approve of those who receive the truth in unrighteousness; thou didst not care to have any fellowship with them; thou didst not approve of heathenish talk and wrong actions. But, at that time, thy reading was pleasant to thyself, thy secret prayers to God were sweet; thou wast joyful, and thoughtful, and internally illuminated when thou hadst a word to say for thy Lord, or when thou didst expound at a loss for words, thou didst not tire, nor be at a loss for words. And thy words to us were good, and to some of thy friends and mine; good words, peaceable words; words of Christ were thy words and thy writing too.</p>
         <p>Now, O Son, O Leonard, I am thoughtful much for thee,—for thee and for thy wife (Maud) and her child. Suffer my single word O friend, that is, dwell quietly. Do not thou have anything to say against the faith, or against the ruler of the church; lest thy lips should err. Yes, dwell peaceably, and repent thou when the stirring up time shall come from the presence of God. Do not thou attend to Heathen men, to their sayings; perhaps it would be much better if thou wert to listen to that of thy Minister who truly loves thee, &amp; who watcheth for thy soul—having regard to his own Judge— And, although perhaps thou will not assent to what I write at this present time, nor will thou perhaps receive what I say when it reaches thee; yet leave it awhile; to my mind it is true; and I yet look forward in expectation of receiving thy full assent thereto, hereafter;—when the scales shall have fallen from thine eyes.</p>
         <p>Behold, I am left alone, O Sir, O Leonard, I am left alone by myself; but, not so. Here, with me, is my Protector. Greatly hath he comforted me this day; He will not forsake me. Yes, this day, at this time, this time of weakness, and trouble, has he made His strength to appear in his weak servant, that the churches may see that from Him alone is strength derived.</p>
         <p>Now, know, O Sir, I pray for thee, that thine eyes may be opened; that thou mayest be lifted up out of the miry pit, and that thou mayest be made to stand anew upon the Rock. Yes, &amp;, for thy wife likewise for Maud, that her heart may be consoled by the Comforter. That is all, it is finished.</p>
         <p>From me is this writing</p>
         <p>From thy loving Minister,</p>
         <p>From           Colenso.</p>
         <p rend="center">No. 3.</p>
         <p>Extracts from Leonard’s answer to the foregoing</p>
         <p>“O Sir, O Colenso, greeting to thee, the man who is crying to God, greeting to thee, yes, O Sir, greeting to thee. This is my word to thee. Good is thy word of condemnation of me, it is good. Yes, I will assent to thee on account of my sins. Yes, I am a sinful man, I will not deny that which thou hast here said, it is good. I told thee on this Sabbath-day, &amp; before also, that it was want of food, and the continual wandering of the people, and the thought for my body, this is the root of my errors, of my sins, this is the very thing. xxxxxxxxxxxx O Sir, behold, that thou shouldest put me down is good, thou didst say that I should be a Teacher, and thou hast taken it from me it is good. xxxxxxxxxxx. For two weeks hast thou been preaching about me, therefore I went inland, to my estate, to Heretaunga, and on Sunday when you saw me you were again angry with me, and so on to the Monday, I said this is Heathenish anger against me, for two weeks hast thou been at me, then I said, It is just as though I had made myself the head of the teacher that thou keepest grumbling so at me, for two weeks hast thou been mocking me, I will go out x x x x x. Now, if it is for my sins that thou hast put me down, why didst thou not put me down at the time? rather it is because I answered thee that thou hast thus put me down. x x x x x Thou seekest to see upon me the fruits of repentance; let that wish be there aside; if thou shouldest see that it is true, if wrong let it be so. x x x x x</p>
         <p>Behold, here is my one word, that is concerning our bodies; behold, I have been a shield (for thee) the breakwater of the bows, but now that it is broken down, the waves will rush into midships; this is sufficient. I, perhaps, had better step aside, I, this defence of this storehouse, I, the door which has been broken; I, this fence which has been battered down; being dirty, being defiled with wickedness, with sin, with darkness, with error; henceforward nothing but wind shall blow on the earth; take back then thy gift of kindness to me x x x x x</p>
         <p>That is all, from thy son formerly, now from error, from sin, from wickedness this to thee, </p>
         <p>(Signed) From Leonard formerly, at present from error this letter to thee.”</p>
         <p>A day or two afterwards (during my absence at Tangoio) he sent me another letter, extracts from which I here subjoin.—</p>
         <p>“O my father, greeting to thee. Good is thy word of lamentation over me; it is good. x x x x Behold, my words against thee are gone forth, of which thou hast already heard through Heihei. It was thy fault, in that thou didst grumble so continually at me, therefore I said to thee, that I am a body shield, a break-wind and these thou hast broken down. Behold the wind blows upon the earth how violently! Notwithstanding my words concerning thee are nothing but bad, because thou didst find fault with me. That is it—it is evil, a thrusting thee forth, that thou mayest begone; and I, I have been seen by the shepherd’s of Christ’s flock, and they have known me. I do belong to the fold, an erring sheep whom Satan &amp; Colenso have slain, &amp; Christ will leave the flock and return to search for the sheep which erred. </p>
         <p>Behold, hear thou, great will be the wind blowing upon the earth. Behold my anger against thee is great, but within my heart there is nothing but love towards thee. Behold, be thou very patient when the wind shall have reached thee,. That is all, here I am still feeling love towards thee, From thy bad son, From Leonard.</p>
         <p>If thou shouldest be thrust out by the people &amp; bid begone, do not thou be cast down at that saying. Presently I will be angry with this people, I shall fight against them this day. When thou arrivest here, a Committee will be held about thee, by this people, and if their talk concerning thee be bad, then will I turn upon them and chide them. I will not permit thee to be killed by them, no, thy being angry with me, and my being angry with thee is all very good, because it is a parent’s anger and a child’s anger, afterwards the parent is a parent and the child is a child, sympathizing back and sympathizing forth, loving back and loving forth. And there is love yet within the heart, although great may be the evil towards thee, be thou very patient, for if they should leap forward to attack thee it will be bad.”</p>
         <p>(I suppose, that Leonard having succeeded in rousing the evil passions of the Native Chiefs (and seeing the extent to which he had carried them,) his heart began to fear the ultimate consequences, and therefore he wrote me the foregoing. Mrs Colenso tells me, it was brought by Muora, L’s. wife, on the evening of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Jany., the day of my return to the Station)</p>

         <p>O Sir, greeting to thee, this is our word to thee, listen thou, on Friday come hither, that we may talk together, and put in order the talk which is straight and the talk which is wrong, which has been shewn to us this year, and the ways of former days which are good or bad. Those which are bad to be cast aside, those which are good to be retained as valuable and as work for the people. If thou assent to these words, that is all the talk will be finished upon thy assenting, that is all.</p>

         <p>(1.) O ye people, O Ngatikahungungu, greeting to you. This is my question to you, What is this Committee of yours? Is it a committee upon native things? or is it a committee upon sacred subjects? If it be a committee upon native things, it is very good, to yourselves belong those things; but what have I to do with them? If it be a committee upon sacred things, things appertaining to worship, – – – – listen all of you, for me alone, for the root is it to think &amp; direct about such things; as for this committee of yours, it is mere children’s work, a canoe without a figure-head or rudder, a committee idly called without authority.        From me</p>

         <p>(2) Come hither, my writing and go to the sheep of Christ, sitting astray here at the Awapuni. O my flock alas! greeting to thee; behold, this is from thy Lord to thee O flock, that is, “His sheep hear his voice”: behold, here with me, with his servant is his voice. Therefore it is that I say unto thee, O flock; Arise, depart, hasten to your own pastures, and feed there upon sweet grass, for at the Awapuni is no sweet grass or cool water.</p>

Listen! your writing has come to me; behold, ye say, that ye are my loving friends; now then, if that be true, cease back-biting me.— “The thrust of a stick may be parried aside, the thrust of a word will not go aside.” (a well-known nat. prov.)

         <p>“To Colenso, Waitangi. O Sir, here is this word to thee, we shall not go to service on this Sabbath, for it is of no use to attend service, and turning away at the same time, better to make peace with man, &amp; then make peace with God. If thou hadst listened to those our words which were written to thee, by this it wd. have been over. As it is, thou hast drawn it out to a great length; behold, sufficient is this, there is no more good that we should attend service together. Notice this, remain thou away on that side (of the river) to prayers. Here is this word of ours likewise to thee, listen thou, on Monday we shall come over to thee that we may talk together; do not thou set this aside; this is a good thing. For if thou set this aside, the flock will no longer look upon thee as a shepherd. Then, depart thou hence from the whole of Heretaunga; think not thou, from hence, from the Awapuni alone, but from the whole of New Zealand. It is finished.”</p>

         <p>O Sirs. I have only just now looked at your writing; on my return from bathing. Here I have torn up your letter, and returned it to you; it being a writing of bad words. I have already written to you,—saying, ye have nothing whatever to do either with me or my work; ye take too much upon you to dictate thus to me. Now I will not see you tomorrow, even though ye should take upon yourselves to come across. For this reason that your error is increasing. When ye shall have repented heartily of your misdeeds, then shall we see (one another). But from me will be the appointment.</p>

Write hither, that I may know. Seeing that it was you two who fixed me here upon this spot from wh. I am now thrust forth.

Do not thou upon any account leave, nor we either, until the arrival of Mr. Williams &amp; the Bishop, then thou wilt be able to speak when there shall be Europeans to listen. Behold, here is the word which we have heard, That a payment is being collected for their having bound thee. Do not thou on any account turn to them, (i.e. receive it) for the causelessness of they suffering is fully seen. It is thy son Leonard who has murdered thee. This also, we have heard, that Tareha, Te Moananui, and Karaitiana, are writing for another Minister to come for this place. Let there be no other Minister but thee for Heretaunga.

When the news concerning thee arrived here, that thou wert being ill-used for the holy word of God, I said, It is well; because, is it only so now, in these latter times? no, from of old, even so says the preacher of his word. Stephen, what was done to him? He was stoned. What was done to Paul? He was put to death for the word of God. What was done to Shadrack &amp; his party? They were cast into the fiery furnace of Nebuchadnezzar. Therefore do I say concerning thy ill-usage, it is well. This is my word of simile; even thy own word, when thou and I were at Port Nicholson “What effect will that have upon flint, upon iron, upon lime, the fire will not affect them. O Sir, do thou &amp; I cleave to Christ, even as the <hi rend="strikethrough">paua</hi>
