         <p>T.F. Cheeseman, Esq</p>
         <p>Auckland.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>A short time ago I wrote you a few lines to let you know I had <hi rend="italic">not </hi>forgotten you, neither my promise made in a former note. I must now send you what I have been able to collect from my spns., but I would almost rather not send them,—as some are so small &amp; scrappy, and, of course, unsatisfactory to both you and <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>: but <hi rend="italic">I have done my best.</hi>—I cannot think whatever became of the specimens of my 2 recently described species, (<hi rend="italic">C. rufescens, </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">C. heterophylla</hi>,) especially this <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, as I had dried several spns. of it, being struck with the peculiarity of its appearance; it is just possible I sent them <hi rend="italic">all</hi> (the better spns.) to Kew, not caring to keep any: however, I send you <hi rend="italic">all that I have left of these 2</hi>,—and can get you more &amp; better in the spring, should you care to have them:—that is,—<hi rend="italic">If I keep well.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Of <hi rend="italic">C. rufescens, </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">C. ?arcuata </hi>I send you fruits in spirits, besides some dried seeds, which I gathered purposely for you <hi rend="italic">after </hi>my note from Norsewood in March: I call one, <hi rend="italic">C. arcuata</hi>, but only provisionally, as it strongly reminds me of a plant I had so early named in my little pamphlet tour: it may, however, be different.—</p>
         <p>Just before leaving the woods (end of March) I obtained <hi rend="italic">m. </hi>spns. of a fine handsome <hi rend="italic">Coprosma</hi> (<hi rend="italic">C. latifolia</hi>, mihi,): I had, some time ago, gathered what <hi rend="italic">may </hi>be the <hi rend="italic">fem. </hi>(fruitg.) spns. of this species, but I am <hi rend="italic">not satisfied </hi>as to this.—Another peculiar sp. is the one I have named <hi rend="italic">C. maculata</hi>,—long <hi rend="italic">vexatiously </hi>known to me, and plentiful enough, but I could never get <hi rend="italic">good </hi>spns.,—as the cattle are ravenously fond of it, (its stems &amp; branches being sub-succulent &amp; brittle,) and insects by 0000’s feed on its leaves, which, also, I think, suffer from frost.—</p>
         <p>Some of these sps. (as, Nos. I. II. and IV.) I had sent to Petrie.—</p>
         <p>I hope to get to the woods next week, (my last autumnal visit,) and I will keep a look-out for you, but the present is the wrong season of the year.</p>
         <p>Should you wish to see more or better spns. of any of these now sent,—just give me their nos.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are keeping well, and with kind regards,</p>
         <p>             I am, Dr. Sir,</p>
         <p>                             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                             Wm. Colenso.</p>

         <p>P.S. In looking over my “notes”—I find—</p>
         <p>No. 5, tall slender shrub, 12–14 feet, branches long slender, drooping: fruit, fully ripe, pleasing light orange, sub-globose, 3 l. diamr., sweet.—</p>
         <p>No. 8—fruits darker orange (vid. Desriptn.)</p>
         <p>I thought, when I wrote my note, I had put up a few fruits of <hi rend="italic">No. 5 </hi>in spirits:—but I cannot find them! these fruits, <hi rend="italic">ripe</hi>, are always scarce, being soon devoured by birds, &amp;c., besides this shrub is also scarce while No. 8 is plentiful.</p>
