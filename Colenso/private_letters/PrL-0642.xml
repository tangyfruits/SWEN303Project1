         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>For some time I have been thinking of writing to you, &amp; now that I am about leaving for the Bush (for 2–3 weeks), I do so:—(1.) to ask If you could kindly insert in vol. XIX. “TRans.”, a small “errata” of a few errors made in my papers in vol. XVIII, which have been brought to my notice: (2.) to enquire, If Mr. Buchanan is still with you,—or, in Wellington &amp; well: as early as March I wrote to him, enclosing spn. of a grass from the mountain ranges for his opinion, which I supposed to be new—it is a sp. of <hi rend="italic">Agrostis</hi> &amp; near to our published ones,—and Mr. Buchanan, in his Work on our <hi rend="italic">Grasses </hi>(the <hi rend="italic">addenda</hi>), mentions his having lately received intermediate forms, &amp;c. but I have not heard from him in reply: and so I have ventured to trouble you,—please kindly inform me.   I am,</p>
         <p>                             Dr. Sir,</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                             W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
   </text>
