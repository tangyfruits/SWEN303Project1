         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have to thank you for your kind loan of Book &amp; spn. (<hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi>) from Col. Museum—to hand last week: I now return them to you by steamer leaving here tomorrow. Through your kindness I was enabled closely to examine and compare the few bones I had acquired of a small <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi>: my paper on them was read here on Monday last, &amp; perhaps you may receive it by this mail.</p>
         <p>I received the little case safely (though no note came with it), and hope it may reach you all right. The skeleton was partially disjointed in its case: I trust it was so when packed up.—</p>
         <p>             I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
