         <p rend="end">Napier, Tuesday June 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1882</p>
         <p>Mr J. Drummond </p>
         <p>Ongaonga</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I duly received your letter of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,—and I was glad to see your handwriting and to know that you were all <hi rend="italic">well</hi>—and though last <hi rend="italic">not</hi> least, of the addition to your family; well, now you have a pair—one boy, &amp; one girl—which is nice, and I do hope they will, in days to come, prove blessings to you &amp; to your good wife. It has rejoiced me to hear of Mrs Drummond being well—after her ma­ternal trial; you did not say, if your own good mother were with you. I am pleased to find that you received the papers I had sent. I had just posted (2?) more for you when your letter arrived. I have been thinking over you since, as I wish <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Volume of “Transactions” had come to hand that I might send you a copy—but none have yet come <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, though I know of a few having been issued,—say, to the big Dons; I wrote to Dr Hector last week reminding him, but it is the Binding (weak though it is) that takes a long while.—</p>
         <p>Another thing that caused me to think <hi rend="italic">on</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> was my letter (or two now) to “D.T.”—which I would like for you to see;<note xml:id="ftn3-150" place="foot" n="150"> Stilling the waves. <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> 26 June 1882.</note> I think you told me, that the “D.T.” was not taken in at O—I am sorry for that; however, with this, I will post my “D.T.” of last evening.</p>
         <p>I am busy, hard at work getting up another Paper for our Society.</p>
         <p>You enquire about books being <hi rend="italic">lent,</hi> &amp; refer to a <hi rend="italic">former</hi> Report; we were obliged to stop that, and now they are not <hi rend="italic">lent,</hi> indeed the Library is more of a Students &amp; Reference Library (just as at home in many places)—the big books (£10.10.0 a Vol) could not possibly be lent, &amp; then where to draw the line, we found it impossible, some of the lesser works (in size) being very valuable, and some folks handle books with greasy paws!!! and as we could not make distinctions, ’tween individuals, &amp; the books, if lent, would be sure to sadly wear &amp; tear, &amp;c, &amp;c, we were obliged to withdraw that old privilege you have referred to. Several have been asked for from the Country, but none sent out.</p>
         <p>As I believe Smith to be altogether wrong <hi rend="italic">re the larva</hi> of the Ant Lion, I have made a scratch drawing of it (but it is not quite so large) and of its <hi rend="italic">open</hi> pit, in which it burys itself in the sand, save its big mandibles; &amp; woe to the insect that comes rolling down the sides; the pit is about 1½—2 in deep.</p>
         <p>And w. kind remembrances to all 3 (4 now) Believe me </p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso</p>
         <p>Glad to hear that Miss Smith was looking into Vol XIII;—­</p>
         <p>P.S. I know the <hi rend="italic">long</hi> caterpillar like larva which Smith mentions W.C.</p>
