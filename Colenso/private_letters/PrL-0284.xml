         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>Thursday, 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir Donald McLean</p>
         <p>I was very glad to hear, in town today, from Mr. Ormond, that you had returned, and that you were in much better health than when you went to your Station.—</p>
         <p>I waited awhile, in hopes of seeing you, as I had heard of your coming to the C. Chamber to see the Natives,—but when I saw their number, &amp; recollected the <hi rend="italic">short</hi> days now,—I beat a retreat.</p>
         <p>I am afraid you may not be <hi rend="italic">here</hi> much longer, and so I write this,—just to let you know, that I shall be happy to call on you at any hour that may be <hi rend="italic">most convenient to you</hi>—whether by day or by night.</p>
         <p>                                     And am</p>
         <p>                             Yours very sincerely</p>
         <p>                                             Wm. Colenso.</p>
