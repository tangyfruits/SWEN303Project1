         <p>Hon. D. McLean</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>As I am not going to say a word about <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>, I may perhaps intrude.—</p>
         <p>I wish to say a little concerning young Carter, (who left here in the “Keera” for Wgn. on Saturday, to join the Constabulary force,)—could you not possibly find some <hi rend="italic">more suitable situation </hi>for the youth? I am quite sure he has very good parts, and with a little more teaching, would become quite an acquisition to any Govt. Department. He is also very anxious to learn more, &amp; I think would get on rapidly.</p>
         <p>So impressed was I with this, that I sent word to his Father, that I would give ₤50. (the utu of a section I have on the White Road) towards his 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. year at Dunedin, if Carter could find the remainder. I don’t know anything of the charges there: but I think <hi rend="italic">you </hi>have influence with the Dunedin folk. And if the ₤50 I offered (for the section) is required by you for that purpose, you shall have it.</p>
         <p>You may see what I have written in the “Herald”—respecting our Maori Prisoner, &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">why</hi> he (<hi rend="italic">like others</hi>) should be pardoned.<note xml:id="ftn2-200" place="foot" n="200"> Colenso’s 1871 <hi rend="italic">Fiat Justitia; being a few thoughts respecting the Maori prisoner Kereopa now in Napier gaol, awaiting his trial for murder</hi>…  was first published as a letter to the editor of the<hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi>. </note> You know what I have told you in past times, respecting the Maoris,—always aiming at the common weal.—I would that <hi rend="italic">you </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">knew</hi> what <hi rend="italic">I now know. </hi>Believe me, that, as in the case of those to whom a proper &amp; prized lenity has been already shewn, so <hi rend="italic">here</hi>: I hope, most sincerely, that should you see what I have written in the Herald you will consider it.—I am very sure you will <hi rend="italic">after</hi> I am gone; if you don’t before. I have heard &amp; read very strange things indeed of late. I cannot write you more.</p>
         <p>     I am,</p>
         <p>             Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
