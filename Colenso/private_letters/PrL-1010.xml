         <p rend="end">Napier, Sept. 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.,<lb/>1897: ix, p.m.</p>
         <p>Tired though I am (more with writing for S.F. Mail, than by my unusual move out this morning,) I must not think of retiring until I have performed a duty and written a little note to <hi rend="italic">you </hi>on behalf of my little godson Rodolph Maia. I wish to make him some little handy present, but for the life of me I cannot think of one that pleases me and that he and you would approve! and yet I have some <hi rend="underline italic">old</hi> English fancies floating before me—images of the <hi rend="italic">long past</hi>! shall I venture to name them?—for you and the Doctor to laugh at? Yes, I will <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, lest I should be considered a <hi rend="italic">coward</hi>! (which would never do in writing of <hi rend="underline italic">Rodolph Maia</hi>). A red coral (set in silver with silver bells! “Ugh! that is antiquated &amp; hard for his gums, better a bit of Indian Rubber,”—his father says—and <hi rend="italic">I agree</hi>, and give in:—and beg permission to enclose a little chq. for Rodolph: which you are to use as you think best. Now a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> half dozen <hi rend="underline italic">extra</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> of mother’s &amp; father’s kisses </hi>for the dear boy, and May <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> blessing ever be his!—</p>
         <p>With kind regards,<lb/>Believe me Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
