         <p rend="end">Napier, Jany. 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1882</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Thanks many for your kind note of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. (to hand last night), and for accompanying slip of Appx. II.</p>
         <p>I have read it over 3 times! and I cordially acquiesce in <hi rend="italic">several</hi> of your proposed alterations,—which are, no doubt, real amendments for such a vol. as your “Trans.”, and I thank you for making them, for which I feel indebted: nevertheless there are a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> I would rather had not been made. Still, under all the circumstances, <hi rend="italic">I assent to your corrections</hi>; <hi rend="italic">but</hi>, if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> allow of what I have marked <hi rend="italic">red</hi> (a very small no.) to <hi rend="italic">remain</hi>,—in the manner I have indicated on a separate sheet of paper enclosed,—I will thank you. I fancy, that some (at least) of my suggestions you will agree to.</p>
         <p>I can very well understand how you came to delete &amp; alter so largely—to tone down, as it were, what I had written &amp; read here—from your point of view in the field: were I <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, no doubt, I should have done the same:—or, rather, not altered so ably as you have managed to do. But then, with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, from my position, it is widely different in this <hi rend="italic">one </hi>matter—<hi rend="italic">re</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Old</hi> Maoris &amp; their language; if I know anything at all, I know of this; and I cannot allow Mr. Stack to approach my platform, or standpoint. I assure you, that the idea <hi rend="italic">often</hi> occurred to me, when writing that Paper &amp; appendices,—of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, yourself, with your superior knowledge of Geology, being opposed by some tyro, or smatterer, in that Science,—or having to take up some absurdities of his! But then came this <hi rend="italic">great</hi> difference: he would have all the Geologists everywhere against him; and he could, also, yet learn from them, from Nature, &amp; from Books:—but, in this case (Mr Stack and <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>), all such could not possibly be; and hence it comes to pass, that I (knowing so much as I do, or think I do,) am driven to speak plainly; at the same time, always desirous of giving <hi rend="italic">my reasons</hi> for it. (see end)</p>
         <p>Perhaps I should tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>,—that when Bp. Selwyn came to N.Z. (or soon after), and <hi rend="italic">many of us</hi> were residing with him at his Waimate Coll.,—<hi rend="italic">he</hi> made me the Coll. Prof. of Maori: and the Bp. himself, his lady, the examg. Chaplain Cotton, &amp; all the Clergy (Parsons and Parsonettes) attended my class, &amp;c, &amp;c. And so with the Bps. weekly <hi rend="italic">Maori</hi> Sermons, &amp;c., the heads of which were translated into Maori <hi rend="italic">by me</hi>, &amp; printed by his people at his private press.—</p>
         <p>I have frequently regretted that I did not <hi rend="italic">earlier </hi>take up Mr. Stack—in his <hi rend="italic">first </hi>Papers of “Ogre bands”, &amp;c, &amp;c.,—which, at the time, I had a great mind to do: and, I may tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, that one reason for my not doing so, was the old steady friendship which was between his father and myself.—</p>
         <p>And, do not be offended with me for plain speaking—I appeal to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as the Editor &amp; Manager of your justly-esteemed annual vol. of Trans. You must have noticed how I have plainly dealt with others,—<hi rend="italic">e.g. </hi>Coleman Phillips, Grace, R. Taylor, J. White, C.O. Davis, Sir G. Grey, and even my dear &amp; esteemed <hi rend="italic">old </hi>friend Sir Jos. Hooker (as, even <hi rend="italic">now</hi> again! &amp; more anon). For, if you admit (unintentionally) of <hi rend="italic">error</hi> into the pp. of your Trans., you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> (may I not be permitted to say?) also admit of its correction: I am sure you will agree to this.—</p>
         <p>But I must stop.</p>
         <p>I regret to find you saying, that this Appendix II., even as corrected by you,— “cannot now appear in its <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> place”. Why not? unless those sheets are already worked off: and even then, perhaps, it might be done. But that I leave with you.</p>
         <p>Could you let me have 4 or 6 slips of it <hi rend="italic">uncorrected</hi>?</p>
         <p>I wrote to you on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., sending also my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> packet of Papers; which I suppose, will reach you today.</p>
         <p>I also received yesterday a note from Mr. G.M. Thomson of Dunedin, informing me of your having kindly consented to the publication of my old Ruahine Mss. in their projected Journal of Science. I thank you, also, for this: I had desired Mr Thomson to write to you respectying them.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Very sincerely yours</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Believe me, I would <hi rend="italic">much rather </hi>have <hi rend="italic">nothing whatever </hi>to do with this correcting of others <hi rend="italic">errors—</hi>whether <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Mao. or any thing else:—I would infinitely prefer going <hi rend="italic">quietly</hi> on with my little Botanl. investigations: but, somehow, I think it is <hi rend="italic">my duty </hi>to correct all such errors.                W.C.</p>
