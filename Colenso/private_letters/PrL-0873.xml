         <p rend="end">Napier Sunday night,<lb/>July 16, 1893.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>I think I cannot do better than to begin a letter to you this night. Yours of the 9<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. I duly recd. &amp; with it Papers &amp; clippings—such a lot! I was glad to hear from you, for, to tell you the truth, I was getting uneasy!! as much owing to the general prevalence of “Measles” as to anything—I rejoice w. you in your having <hi rend="italic">health</hi> &amp; light in the dwelling!—First, a few words <hi rend="italic">re </hi>self: Monday 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. was a gloomy lowering day w. showers towards evg.—however, I went to our Meeting—there was a good attendance (say 25, or more)—at opening (Humphries Chn.) Dinwiddie Hon. Secy. produced a <hi rend="italic">big </hi>letter, to hand that evg., from XtCh., contg. Petition to Parlt. <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Hd.Bk. &amp; <hi rend="italic">Kirk</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">portion </hi>was read to meeting, then Chn. asked mtg to agree to it!—I rose &amp; said,—such ought not to be put in that kind of way, and, that, even I did not understand it clearly; then more talk, (all being botanists now-a-days!) <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Hd.Bk, its scarcity,—need of a 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. ed., &amp;c. Seeing time wasted in this kind of way, I rose again, &amp; asked, “What is the (<hi rend="italic">advd.</hi>) work of this meeting? for if that new matter was to occupy the time I should not read my 2 papers tonight because I saw <hi rend="italic">several papers </hi>on table belonging to that Petition, that had not yet been opened. So, at last, it was agreed to set it aside for the Council. I then began my Paper—in the <hi rend="italic">worst </hi>voice I have known for 15 mths. all owing to that cold caught at Dvk.—that ended, &amp; a <hi rend="italic">few </hi>qns. asked, &amp; things shown, I took up No. 2 (this I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> would evoke discussion, <hi rend="underline italic">&amp;c</hi>.)—it was mainly about Collie, our <hi rend="italic">old</hi> photographer (in the ’70s.) do you recollect him? He had been twice to Tongariro, &amp; passed 1 nt. <hi rend="italic">down in the Crater</hi>, some 7–8 yrs. before Hill! then Collie’s advents. visit &amp; residence for a month on White Island, &amp;c &amp;c. At close, Hill explained, &amp;c, &amp;c to some length—&amp; had it not been so very late (past x) no doubt H. would have gone on longer, <hi rend="italic">and</hi>, fortunately, Coffee was <hi rend="italic">ready</hi>, and this, and chat, &amp; showing photos. &amp;c (taken by C. of Tong., Rotorua, White Island, &amp;c &amp;c) &amp; finally, <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, on XtCh. Petition,—all hands! (it seemed, as if Humphries was detd. to have it decided there &amp; then—by a kind of “closure”!) so I spoke strongly against such a line of proceeding—that (as far as I knew) the Petr. w. its papers (still unread!) were more fit for botanical experts, and the <hi rend="italic">Council</hi>: so at last it was carried—to do so. I to have the papers, &amp; on reading report to C.—Two days after I got them here, and now I find—letters from Hooker, from Müeller, &amp; from Hector, all in Kirk’s favour—to give <hi rend="italic">him </hi>the job!!! <hi rend="italic">I am very sorry for this</hi>: I have not yet written my report (as the Council, D. told me, will <hi rend="italic">not meet </hi>directly,) but shall do it very soon. I retd. to my house, <hi rend="italic">very </hi>tired, <hi rend="italic">worn</hi>, at x.45, found folks gone to bed (of course) &amp; fine <hi rend="italic">out</hi>—so I went upstairs—but <hi rend="italic">not </hi>to sleep; next day I felt very unwell, and the kind-hearted Bp. having heard of my <hi rend="italic">long </hi>night at the oar &amp; husky voice, came early to see me, &amp; to apologize for <hi rend="italic">not</hi> being there. This past week we have had <hi rend="italic">3 fine </hi>days in succession (Friday being a glorious one! &amp; I down in town), but today is again cold wet dark!!—</p>
         <p>Since my last I have recd. “author’s copies”, vol. XXV. (in 2 lots—the smaller one on Friday: D. had them also in <hi rend="italic">another </hi>bundle) I sent you a copy of no. 1, &amp; I will also send no. 2 with this. I have also recd. my copy of vol. XXV <hi rend="italic">from </hi>Wgn.,—and am not altogether pleased with it—especially with Quatrefage’s <hi rend="italic">old </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">repubd. </hi>paper!!! I shall have to write a p. on <hi rend="italic">this</hi>—mainly on behalf of von Haast—as <hi rend="italic">we 2 </hi>were to have taken it up, when it first came out in “Annals N. Histy.” Lond., <hi rend="italic">1884</hi>.,—but Haast’s going to London to preside over N.Z. Exhibition put it off, &amp; then his death so soon after his return—but I intend to give <hi rend="italic">his </hi>letters w. my replies, &amp;c. re same, &amp; have “summat” to say to the Frenchm. And. also, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>this resuscitation, and its so-called translation “<hi rend="italic">from Fr</hi>. by <hi rend="underline italic">L.B</hi>.” more anon.—</p>
         <p>For my part, I would, for the <hi rend="italic">future</hi>, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>vols. Trans., that Maskell’s interminable <hi rend="italic">Cocci </hi>should be <hi rend="italic">kept out </hi>(I have a vol. recently to hand, parts V–VII, of Brown’s beetles, from Dr Hector who says, “<hi rend="italic">Kept out of Trans.</hi>” &amp; pubd. separately,”)—M. now goes in for <hi rend="italic">Cocci</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Australia</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">all parts</hi>, &amp; really this is too much of Cocci <hi rend="italic">for me</hi>: then I hope Buller will have “said his say” on our Birds—it seems an everlasting theme w. him: there is much besides by B., at end of vol., &amp; there <hi rend="italic">are </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">errors</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> there</hi>, which I may have to <hi rend="italic">notice</hi>, <hi rend="underline italic">again</hi>: <hi rend="italic">I am not</hi>, however, surprised at Buller.—As you had remarked, my p. on “Radiant Phenomenon”, was <hi rend="italic">omitted</hi>: I am not sorry for this, indeed I <hi rend="italic">had </hi>thoughts (while corrg. revises of my papers) to say <hi rend="italic">to H. </hi>to <hi rend="italic">keep it out</hi>; I knew <hi rend="italic">well </hi>that Maskell (if he should read it) would violently oppose it, for I had questioned Constantine’s seeing the  in the sky, &amp; had drawn largely from contemp. historians. But enough of this. When my p. on Quatre. is finished I will submit draft to you.—</p>
         <p>Again have I been delighted w. your Paper on “<hi rend="italic">Unwritten </hi>Literature”—and last Sunday (9<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.) on reading in a fav. author (Jowett—Regius prof. Greek, Oxford—translations &amp; commenty. on Eps. to Thess. Rom. Gal.) I met with <hi rend="italic">these </hi>words, I determined to copy them <hi rend="italic">for you </hi>(&amp; <hi rend="italic">for me</hi>, too,) they seem to convey the meaning of my words to you in my last, re your Paper:—at the close of his “Introduction”, he says:— “He is indebted to the writers named above for numberless references,—for a great portion of his materials, and for several thoughts and observations; which latter, not having been taken directly from their works, he would find it impossible to separate from his own remarks, or to assign to their original owner.”</p>
         <p>You will have heard of the death of Mr. John Chambers—it took me by surprise, as, although I had heard of his having been <hi rend="italic">very ill</hi> last summer, I had also heard of his being got round again: I lament (<hi rend="italic">vainly</hi>!) my <hi rend="italic">not </hi>having visited him—after so many invitations! so many broken promises!! Tiffen was there a fortnight ago, &amp; neither T. nor I could go to the funeral at Havelock—<hi rend="italic">both of us having colds</hi> &amp; fearing exposure: there is a long article, mainly respg. J.C., in “Dy. T.” of last night which I will send you. There are however several errors in it; and it certy. is <hi rend="italic">not </hi>written by <hi rend="italic">R.P. </hi>J.C. was a fortunate man—in many respects (and he <hi rend="italic">deserved </hi>it!) particularly in having his 3 daughters married, &amp; his sons also, &amp; all <hi rend="italic">settled</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">doing well</hi>. The newly-arrd. Minister at Taradale is spoked <hi rend="italic">well </hi>of—by his flock: this <hi rend="italic">wet </hi>Sunday weather will <hi rend="italic">try them all</hi>. Somewhat like <hi rend="italic">my expce. this time last year </hi>at Woodville! <hi rend="italic">Sad </hi>entrys in Diary! By the way, in this <hi rend="italic">large </hi>vol. of Brown’s Beetles, I notice, <hi rend="italic">Costall’s </hi>name, as imprint at T. page, &amp; end—scarcely I think <hi rend="italic">fair </hi>to memory of D.—<hi rend="italic">with you</hi>, I am sad to know that <hi rend="italic">Costall </hi>gained the sitn., &amp; (also, w. you) am sorry to find he has such a perverted taste—abjuring that nice praiseworthy “<hi rend="italic">simplicity</hi>”. And so I go w. you, entirely, in your proper remarks on Sir W. Fox, &amp; on B., and on the “indecent” paper the Govt. have lately pubd. <hi rend="italic">re </hi>priv. notes &amp; telegrams to B’s. widow: what next?—My free remarks to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">re </hi>your lately printed book, had more reference to the <hi rend="italic">Binder</hi>, who might have placed a “pale-face” to confront a “pale-face”, and vice versa.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="underline italic">17</hi>
            <hi rend="sup underline italic">th</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">. (night.)</hi> (another day of rain! fresh slips!!) Now I go on w. my letter. I have just finished a long letter (5, 4to. ps.) to the Chn. of our Council <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Xt.Ch. Institute’s Petition—I have done my duty to the Colony—&amp; to all good &amp; true Botanists—<hi rend="italic">i.e. </hi>those who wk <hi rend="italic">con amore </hi>&amp; not for love of lucre! I hope our Council may send it (or its copy) to Xt.Ch. I have recd. (as usual) a lot of strange papers, pamphlets, &amp;c, &amp;c, from Engd. &amp; U.S. by this late mail—one in partr. (being <hi rend="italic">wholly new</hi>) I shall send on to you—though you, too, may have it.—Some, <hi rend="italic">marked</hi>, to be returned to me. One, a spn. page of vol.II. of a <hi rend="italic">new Dicty</hi>., is <hi rend="italic">surprising</hi>. In a Pall Mall Gaz. (sent on to Hamilton) is a long memoir <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Owen, with a big cut of Owen in his robes standing by the big Moa (from his work), and under it—“<hi rend="italic">Puornus</hi>”—<hi rend="italic">for </hi>Dinornis—With you (again!) I like many lines in Wm. Morris’ poetry—which I return w. thanks. I saw in some Paper (Eng. I think) of the appt. of <hi rend="italic">Lewis </hi>M. to the Laureateship. I note what you say in the Rees-Carman cases and venture to think you are wrong: I do so from (1) having heard so <hi rend="italic">much </hi>of it during my prolonged stay at Dvk. in ’91 &amp; ’92, so that all this <hi rend="italic">after </hi>talk is spite &amp; envy,: and (2) from the <hi rend="italic">char. </hi>of <hi rend="italic">Rees</hi> in matters of <hi rend="italic">Maori </hi>lands at P. Bay &amp; E. Coast, <hi rend="italic">and </hi>his bursting! because he was checkmated last year in his attempt to get <hi rend="italic">such </hi>a billet for himself: I consider R. a very dangerous man—&amp; that <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> only now, but from the beg.—in John Sheehan’s time: I trust </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">he</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> may never again enter the House</hi>.—W.C.S. has never been a favourite of mine, but one thing is certain—S. has been a <hi rend="italic">good useful working </hi>M. <hi rend="italic">for his constituents</hi>, &amp; I hope he may be retd. again.</p>
         <p>I ought to say <hi rend="italic">something</hi> to you in reply for your 3 pages Ms. <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Tregear &amp; Atkinson, (all, however, interesting). I wish <hi rend="italic">you had read</hi> his pamphlet, &amp; not merely listened to a <hi rend="italic">picked bit </hi>by T. &amp; read to you: I would gladly lend you my copy had you expressed a wish to see it, but I will not force it on you.—–</p>
         <p>One thing you seem to forget, viz. Atkinson’s former paper against Tregear’s Aryan Cow vagaries—in 1886, in vol. XIX. “Trans.” I say, “forget”, bec. you ask, Why should A. <hi rend="italic">now come out </hi>on T’s. work? it is but a following up of his old paper—but, mind, in my so saying, <hi rend="italic">I know nothing </hi>of all! I sent you a paper containing no. 2. letter by Howlett.—I <hi rend="italic">have seen </hi>in T’s. Dy., pref., what you have pointed out:—true, <hi rend="italic">in a note</hi>, but it was the <hi rend="italic">very least </hi>he could do. You also tell me what he had said to you, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>W.C. &amp; <hi rend="italic">his </hi>Dy., &amp; no doubt all that is correct: but what then?—Do you not see, that, if I had listened to T’s. overture, &amp; sent him my Mss. to be copied, that he would have <hi rend="italic">used them </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">also</hi>? His secret, sly, private work, (unknown as far as I was concerned) now <hi rend="italic">reveals </hi>it: T. must have been <hi rend="italic">years </hi>engaged on his Dy., from <hi rend="italic">before </hi>we correspd. I have little doubt. I happened to find a letter of his, last week,—in searching after an old letter—and I send it to you for perusal. If T. had been <hi rend="italic">faithful</hi>, he might have succeeded w. his Ministerial friends—but (as I <hi rend="italic">now view </hi>it) <hi rend="italic">it was owing </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">to him</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, &amp; those <hi rend="italic">many others </hi>of the Govt. officers, scattered in N.Z. that, while <hi rend="italic">all had promised well at first</hi> (some nobly volunteering!) all after a while <hi rend="italic">ceased</hi>! &amp; more, replied w. <hi rend="italic">contumely</hi>!—</p>
         <p>In “D.T.” <hi rend="italic">this evg. </hi>is a remark by Ed. on Costall’s <hi rend="italic">finery</hi>: “The Budget—issued in a fancy blue cover suitable for Drawing v. table. Never saw a Py. P. in such a remarke. dressing before—perhaps to keep pace w. the gentm. now so proud of ruling the Country.”</p>
         <p>Could you get me a copy of those favourable reviews of T’s. Dy., pubd. by L. &amp; B.? I gave mine away. And did you look into “<hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>” for that extract?</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Rejoice</hi>—to find you had some work to do, and that Uncle J. was “<hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi>”; would that he had given you a chq. for £100.</p>
         <p>Good bye: tomorrow I hope to begin w. Quatref. Kindest regards to all—</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
