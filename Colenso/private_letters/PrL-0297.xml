         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Sept. 24 1875.</p>
         <p>J.D. Enys Esq, F.L.S.<lb/>&amp;c     &amp;c  &amp;c.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yesterday I received your note of the 7<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst.,—enquiring respecting <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of my little publications (in former days!) on the Natl. Histy. of N.Z. (North Isld.),—in reply, I have to say, that I cannot supply you with copies (save, perhaps,—if of any use,—of the <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> one of the “<hi rend="italic">Ferns.</hi>”) Both papers (with others) were originally published in Tasmania, (through my good friend Lady Franklin, <hi rend="italic">lately</hi> deceased,) in the “Tasmn. Journal of Natural Science,” vols. I &amp; II, (1843–1844.):—and also, the <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> one, by Sir W. Hooker, in the “London Journal of Botany,” vol. III. for 1844. Another of my papers, originally published in Tasmania (as above),—that on the “Moa,”—was, in part, republished by Professor Owen, in the “Annals of Nat. History,” for 1844:—as, indeed, your Dr. Haast, has, I think, subsequently stated.</p>
         <p>During my first years in N.Z., (from ’34 to ’40) I paid particular attention to its Natl. Histy., then but little known,—particularly to its Conchology, Entomology, &amp; Geology (of course, of parts which I then knew), sending copious specimens to England—where they will be found some day! (I may mention, to you, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">discovered Helix Dunniae</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">H. Bushyi</hi>,—and gave specimens to Mr. Alexander Bushy, of N.S.W., who touched at the Bay of Islands on his voyage to England,—and who there ———.) <hi rend="italic">Afterwards </hi>I took up <hi rend="italic">Botany</hi>, in<hi rend="italic"> </hi>great measure owing to my dear friends Allan Cunningham, and Sir W. Hooker.</p>
         <p>Should you care to have a copy of the little <hi rend="italic">brochure</hi>, on<hi rend="italic"> Ferns </hi>(now antiquated), I will send you one with pleasure.—</p>
         <p>                                                                     I am</p>
         <p>                                                                             My dear Sir</p>
         <p>                                                                             Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                                                                                     W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. I could <hi rend="italic">lend </hi>you vol. II. of the “Tasm. Jl. of Nat. Science,” which contains the bigger paper, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. the “Journey” &amp;c., you saw,—if such would be of any service: sending it to &amp; fro, by <hi rend="italic">Registered</hi> post.—I should not like to lose it.            W.C.</p>
