         <p rend="end">Auckland<lb/>Sept 2/67</p>
         <p>Hon. Walter Mantell<lb/>&amp;c               &amp;c</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have your note of this mg., wishing me to inform you, of “Mr Donaldson’s efforts at Napier, their utility.”—</p>
         <p>Unfortunately, I cannot say much, if anything, in his favor.</p>
         <p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. from his antecedents: I should infer he would never be <hi rend="italic">stable</hi>. </p>
         <p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. from what I have heard Karaitiana and other Natives say, I was of opinion, they did not value his exertions too highly.—</p>
         <p>3<hi rend="sup">rd.</hi> I look upon his plan (as far as he has told me of it, &amp; let it be known through the Papers—in which he is a terrible scribbler)—as a highly questionable one—as to its usefulnes, or even being attainable.</p>
         <p>4. I know nothing of <hi rend="italic">his peculiar fitness </hi>for the office of teaching Maories; am rather inclined to doubt it.</p>
         <p>5. He is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> thoroughly sober: but <hi rend="italic">you </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">know</hi> what the Maories say of a man who <hi rend="italic">was </hi>t’other way; and who seeks to get a living by living in their <hi rend="italic">pas</hi> to teach them: they cannot (or rarely) appreciate a good motive. D’s. <hi rend="italic">seeking</hi> to do them good (in his way) actually operates against him.— As to, “whether the Provl. Authors. will join the Genl. Govt. in aiding &amp;c.”—</p>
         <p>I don’t think they would:—</p>
         <p>1. Because D. sent in a petition for aid, 6 months ago, which led to a debate &amp; was refused.– –<lb/>  α. Bec. did not believe in its practicality<lb/>  β. Bec. so much<hi rend="italic">set aside </hi>for <hi rend="italic">Maori </hi>Teaching already in the Prov:—Grey gave 3, or 4000 ac. of the <hi rend="italic">best land</hi> of Prov., &amp; the Natives gave same amount—a property worth ₤10,000.— <lb/>  γ. S. Williams at Te Aute has had, from ₤7000 yearly granted for Schools, ₤1000. or more; &amp;<hi rend="italic">has not a single scholar</hi>!! (This I had from <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Natives just before I left.)<lb/>  δ. Bec. Donaldson’s plan runs counter to the Bp’s.—whose aim is &amp; has been to draw away the N. youth from their<hi rend="italic">pas</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">quasi </hi>College.—</p>
         <p>I think I have said enough: you will see I have written <hi rend="italic">confidentially </hi>to you.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Ormond </hi>is a Mr. of Provl. Council, &amp; of Exec. Cl. also; he could give you (perhaps) more information.</p>
         <p>                     In haste</p>
         <p>             Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>                             Wm. Colenso.</p>
