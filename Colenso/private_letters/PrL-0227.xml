         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Decr. 6, 1867.</p>
         <p>To</p>
         <p>His Excellency</p>
         <p>Sir George Grey, KCB.</p>
         <p>&amp;c  &amp;c  &amp;c</p>
         <p>Kawau, N.Z.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir George Grey</p>
         <p>For some time past we—Napier folk—have been daily on the lookout, hoping to see <hi rend="italic">your </hi>Steamer coming into our Bay, but on Saturday evening last a Steamer was seen steering N. also under sail, which is believed to be yours. Such being the case I fear we shall not now have the pleasure of seeing you <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, if (as we hear) your intention is to leave for England in January via Panama. I should much like to see Your Excellency again in Napier,—and, above all, I regret deeply your having to leave at such a critical period in our history as the arrival of H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh among us. I would, dear Sir George Grey, that (<hi rend="italic">at least</hi>) you had been requested to remain to receive the coming Prince, &amp; to accompany him to visit some of the principal Chiefs and Tribes of New Zealanders, as from such a course much good might reasonably be expected. I confess I feel some difficulty in attempting to convey to your Excellency a scanty outline of my thoughts on this subject.</p>
         <p>I did hope to see you at Wellington in the past spring, and had I gained what I through Dr. Hector sought—permission to visit the Genl. Assembly Library <hi rend="italic">during the Session</hi>—I should have done so. (I have since however obtained permission to use it during the <hi rend="italic">recess.</hi>) I wished to talk with you about the Maori-Eng. Lexicon on which I am engaged; and could I have supposed you would so very shortly and suddenly leave us, I should ere this have done so. I will not however trouble you now, and by letter too, as your time must be very precious indeed. If, however, you have any Maori Mss. lying <hi rend="italic">together</hi>, (which you do not intend to use shortly nor to take with you,) and you would kindly grant me the loan of them during your absence, you would in so doing both confer a favour and help in a great work:—you may rely on my taking the utmost care of them.—And as I remember all your kind expressions respecting it, and believe that you would like to see it finished, I would just ask you dear Sir George Grey, (if I <hi rend="italic">may </hi>do so—under all the circumstances,) to intimate such a desire to Mr. Stafford, or to some one of the Ministry,—as I think such would be beneficial both to the Work &amp; to myself.<note xml:id="ftn2-150" place="foot" n="150"> Grey replied (from Kawau, 15 February 1868), “I will write to Mr. Stafford expressing a strong wish to have the pleasure of seeing the Maori-English Lexicon completed. Such a work will hereafter be of the greatest possible historical interest. I will also speak to Mr. Williamson….”</note> For I have recently received an Official letter from Mr. Rolleston—in which I am informed, “that some doubt exists of the continuation of the Vote beyond the present financial year”. I hope, however, to be able to complete it whether I continue to have Government <hi rend="italic">pecuniary</hi> assistance or not:—hitherto, I am sorry to say, I have had <hi rend="italic">no other</hi>; even the privilege of franking and receiving on P.S. (which your Excellency had kindly granted to me last year) has been taken from me,—so that many of my Mss., &amp;c., now out among several distant Natives cannot readily be returned.—</p>
         <p>I have lately opened a box of Maori <hi rend="italic">Mss.</hi>—vocabularies, travelling Journals, and my old <hi rend="italic">Ms. </hi>Dictionaries of the N. dialects (Ngapuhi and Rarawa,)—which I had packed up in 1842–3! and am almost stunned with the overpowering world of thoughts—rushing &amp; sweeping over the N.Z. history of the last 30–35 years—which these silent yet powerful witnesses evoke!</p>
         <p>I am daily working hard at the Lexn. <hi rend="italic">con amore</hi>, and I find it <hi rend="italic">hard </hi>work, harder than I anticipated. I hope, however, to accomplish it; and that you, dear Sir George Grey—whether among us or in England,—will, some 4 or 5 years hence, hear of the same.</p>
         <p>It has just occurred to me to ask you to say a word to Mr. Williamson, Superintendent, (as I suppose you will be sure to see <hi rend="italic">him </hi>again,) in favour of his helping me—I mean, his encouraging Paul Tuhaere, the Chief in his Executive, (to whom I am about to write,)—or any other person, to do so. I trust in mentioning this I am not exceeding.—</p>
         <p>And—as I cannot now reasonably expect to have the privilege or either writing to you again, or seeing you, ere you leave N. Zealand and us,—permit me, dear Sir George Grey, heartily to wish you a safe and prosperous voyage back to the Old Country,—and (if such be your intention) an equally safe &amp; prosperous return to us at no very distant period:—I venture to think and say, N. Zealand ought not to lose you.—</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>dear Sir George Grey,</p>
         <p>with every respect,</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi> As I believed you would be very sure to receive a copy of my little <hi rend="italic">brochure on </hi>the Botany of the N. Island from Dr. Hector, I did not send you one of the <hi rend="underline italic">very few</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>copies lately to hand. I would that my <hi rend="italic">second, on the Maories</hi>, had been printed, as I should have much liked for <hi rend="italic">you </hi>to have seen what I have said respecting them. W.C.</p>
