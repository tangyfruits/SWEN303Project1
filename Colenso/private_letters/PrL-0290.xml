         <p>Dear Sir Donald McLean</p>
         <p>Your kind note of enquiry <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Lexicon is to hand, and I regret to have to reply in the negative.—</p>
         <p>However I will try hard to get a sufficient portion ready &amp; send after you.—</p>
         <p>I have not been well lately, now 4 days laid up Influenza, but am getting better. I heard continually from Dr. H. of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> getting round, and was much gratified in hearing it.—I should have called last week but I knew you were (as usual) besieged—&amp; your time far too valuable. Wishing you a pleasant voyage.</p>
         <p>     I am</p>
         <p>             Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>2 June 1875</p>
         <p>P.S. This—unfortunately—is my <hi rend="italic">most busy </hi>time of the year as Inspr. of Schools—not merely through midwinter vacation at hand, but having my Annual Report to draw up—and a whole lot of Tabular Statistical Information for P. Council. W.C.</p>
      </body>
