         <p rend="end">Napier, Feby. 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1898.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>Thanks—many &amp; real! for your letter of 30/I: one of the best from you for some time (head &amp; thoughts, perhaps, free from worry, work, and care). It is not yet come to <hi rend="italic">time </hi>to write to you, but now (past xii &amp; waiting for dinner!) I will try to fill up the void. Several items in your last that interest me. (1) Pharazyn’s statement before Court—<hi rend="underline italic">true</hi>, &amp; yet not half total!! The Maoris are being <hi rend="italic">utterly ruined</hi> thro’ <hi rend="italic">Ld. Court</hi>, which should have been their protection: I am tempted strongly to go to Wgn. &amp; see Seddon about them—but while “the Spt. is willing, flesh <hi rend="underline italic">is weak</hi>”.—–</p>
         <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">re </hi>your remark, on my having—part—(?99/100ths) for printing sheets “A”, Mao. Lex—is just:—but I surely told you, <hi rend="underline italic">long ago</hi>, of the arranget. between Seddon &amp; self—viz. “Govt. to pay ₤20. toward it—and I the <hi rend="italic">remainder</hi>”: now, <hi rend="italic">after </hi>that, I further arrgd. w. or through printer for (500?) copies: adding, I did not know how many (if any) the Govt. would require: and now—the <hi rend="italic">rub</hi> (I suppose)—will they, have they, any? How many? and “to be sold by them”, in <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi>? then, there is my letter (<hi rend="italic">temp.</hi> Bal. &amp; Stout) for <hi rend="italic">pay </hi>for <hi rend="italic">that, &amp; all past items of work, from ’70 downwards</hi>—that <hi rend="underline italic">beginning</hi>, A., being expressly ordered by them)—₤<hi rend="italic">300</hi>—including <hi rend="italic">outlays</hi>: but, put off— “till the <hi rend="italic">whole </hi>finished”, &amp;c &amp;c, &amp; <hi rend="italic">never paid</hi>. I suppose the job in <hi rend="italic">binders </hi>hands now—I <hi rend="italic">expressly </hi>desired—<hi rend="underline italic">not</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">wired</hi>—better bound <hi rend="italic">stationers’ </hi>fashion w. bands, &amp;c.—–</p>
         <p>3) your small &amp; imperfect spn. of a plant <hi rend="italic">wonderfully </hi>excited me! at first sight I guessed it! Though I had not seen a spn. for <hi rend="italic">over</hi> 50 yrs. &amp; then only <hi rend="italic">once</hi>; and that <hi rend="italic">inside Wgn. harbour</hi>! well do I recollect it. I think it was in ’45 or ’46: we were scrambling along the rocks &amp; beaches under Cliffs a few miles in from where lighthouse is now, (there being neither road nor pathway then.) to Waiwhetu: well, I saw a plant above me on the cliff, &amp; I climbed up to it, like yours <hi rend="italic">not </hi>in fl., &amp; sent it w. others to Kew. (See “Hd. Bk.”, p.14 <hi rend="italic">Lepidium incisum</hi>). A few years ago Kirk bothered me about its <hi rend="italic">habitat</hi>. I told him—adding, <hi rend="underline italic">he</hi> would <hi rend="italic">never find it there</hi>: true enough: but he did subsy. meet with it in S. Island. Now, for all this story, do you keep a sharp look-out, on <hi rend="italic">yonder </hi>beach, &amp; some day (D.V.) send me a good spn. w. seeds.—</p>
         <p>4.) Two nights ago I was <hi rend="italic">intruded </hi>on after candle light, by a settler from Ormondville (named Chadwick?) who knows a little of Botany—especially <hi rend="italic">smaller </hi>crypts.—respecting similar minute plants as those written for by Mrs. Tindell!! he produced able letters from Home, mentioning her name (extolling), and to <hi rend="italic">see me </hi>for spns. &amp; information. Well: spns. <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>: talk, plenty,—strange, he has been residing 3 yrs at O., often heard of me, but <hi rend="italic">never of my accident</hi>!—he is an <hi rend="italic">educated</hi> man—such as I rarely meet with, &amp; deeply devoted to Botl. science <hi rend="italic">free from gain</hi>—the very <hi rend="italic">opposite </hi>of Kirk.—</p>
         <p>5.) a note of 4 lines from some <hi rend="italic">unknown</hi>, named Wm. Leydell with a parcel of (<hi rend="underline italic">bits</hi> of) spns. to be named! these however nicely preserved: <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>, <hi rend="underline italic">NO!</hi> but I gave way, &amp; spent 2 days over them, wrote List—no reply yet—in Bush.</p>
         <p>(I.45, p.m.)</p>
         <p>6.) Yesty. I wrote my answer to Thornton, Te Aute Coll., accepting w. thanks their choice, &amp;c.—again adding, I <hi rend="italic">did </hi>not, <hi rend="italic">do </hi>not—see how I can possibly be of service to them. [Because, I must be in <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi> to fancied &amp; flash high school teaching for Maoris, rather common technical work—<hi rend="italic">such </hi>of <hi rend="italic">service </hi>to them on leaving school—in their homes and <hi rend="italic">pas</hi>.]</p>
         <p>7.) During <hi rend="italic">all Jany. </hi>no proof of my pamphlet, after first sheet in first week, so on 31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. I went forth to war! told Peter, would <hi rend="italic">not </hi>shake hands—I had come to stop ptg., &amp; to pay for what had been done, &amp; take away copy. P. explained: my <hi rend="italic">own people</hi>, cause No. 1 Bp. D. &amp; Tom Tanner, <hi rend="underline italic">must</hi> have the little Diocesan Synod book ptd. to <hi rend="italic">take w. them</hi> to Xt.Ch.: cause, No.2. <hi rend="italic">Ram Fair. </hi>Catalogues, &amp;c &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">he had seen </hi>his error, &amp;c.—Freeman called down—ordered to get on w. my p., &amp; since that—on to p.52, and a lot of proof for revise in pp., with the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>of the “copy” sent down this morning:—it has been a <hi rend="italic">heavy </hi>job for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and now has <hi rend="italic">soon </hi>to be paid for.—</p>
         <p>8.) Welch being <hi rend="italic">weak</hi>, and having <hi rend="italic">too much </hi>to do, (<hi rend="italic">Dean </hi>gone to Genl. Synod), I again went to St. Aug’s. on Sunday 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> ulto., and got on <hi rend="italic">better </hi>than before: W. at Cathedral last Sunday; Wood at Aug’s:—Dean has sent me 2 papers—their proceedings &amp;c. at their “Ch. Congress”, several plans for amending (?) services, &amp;c.—some visionary <hi rend="italic">in nubibus</hi>!—<hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, here, far more suitable, and <hi rend="italic">needed</hi>. I sent you a “Herald” of 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., containing a nice &amp; proper judgment of Ch. on <hi rend="italic">one </hi>in London: I also sent 2 copies of the same paper to the Dean, &amp; to Eccles. Last night a post-card from Tamumu death of John Mackenzie, 79: an <hi rend="italic">old &amp; valued </hi>acq., can <hi rend="italic">not </hi>go to funeral tomorrow: S.W. Hardy, also, last wk. died <hi rend="italic">very </hi>suddenly—<hi rend="italic">another old</hi> acquaintance: he formerly kept the Govt. School at E. Clive. Ormond kindly called a few days ago, &amp; spent an hour very pleasantly—talkg. of <hi rend="italic">old times</hi>. 3 good useful men—<hi rend="italic">out </hi>of E. Board. Ormond—Capt. Russell—&amp; Carlile—3 <hi rend="italic">new </hi>ones—<hi rend="underline italic">in</hi>—Knight (Dannevirke), Gilberd, &amp; Lernon, a Watchmaker:— “The <hi rend="italic">old</hi> was better”. Dr. S, Grant, Morrison, &amp; others, gone to Assembly at Auckland. Last wk. a long letter from Rev. R. Fraser [<hi rend="underline italic">here</hi>, II.20, p.m. overcome w. sleep, went into my old corner, sofa: at II.40,—Bob. knocked: “Come in!” just awake,—a big packed <hi rend="italic">revise</hi>: so I got up, read twice over (III.45,)—then ½ dozen trots outside, usual course from porch to little gate, first for this day, weather very hot, thermr. in parlour 78°—and now, IV.30, I resume] Mr. Fraser is—<hi rend="underline italic">at last</hi>—much better but feeling <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> (from rain, snow and “slush”) no sun seen, but <hi rend="italic">not </hi>feeling the cold, though he wrote, Xmas. Gives a saddening account of Ch. at Home: <hi rend="italic">pleasure, pleasure, </hi>Sabbath. I must write to him by this Mail. A yg. man from Havelock, name Watt, came to pay me years rent of Sn. leased to <hi rend="italic">Elders</hi>—₤2.10.0: I asked, “Who was the Minr. there last Sunday?” “Mr. Shepherd, he is become a <hi rend="italic">new </hi>man now since his operation”. A scheme on foot to erect a “Memorial—to those drowned last April, all to subscribe!” Much sparring in papers over “Junior Club”, (Hill’s hatching—self, wife, eldest son, ditto daughter, <hi rend="underline italic">chief officers</hi>—a-la- “Genl. Booth!) Come to grief!—<hi rend="italic">last </hi>My. was <hi rend="italic">the day</hi> for annl. mtg. of our Institute—forgotten, I suppose.</p>
         <p>Here I must close: writing every night if possible till X, or so—readg. till XI—bed by XII. rise VI.30, genl. health good. Go to town seldom, too expensive. Baddeley has sold hotel—so <hi rend="italic">no rooms</hi> there for me! </p>
         <p>         Kind regards to you &amp; all yours</p>
         <p>                         Believe me yours faithy</p>
         <p>                                                                         W. Colenso.</p>
