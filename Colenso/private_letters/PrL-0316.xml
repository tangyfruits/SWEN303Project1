         <p rend="end">Napier, New Zealand,<lb/>March 8 1876</p>
         <p>My dear Nephew and Niece,</p>
         <p>I hope you are both quite well,—ditto ditto all the young ’uns. I was only this evening looking at the sun setting—so much earlier than of late—when I said, to my servant, Well, there is one good thing which I always think on with pleasure every year about this season, viz, that in our losing the sun and summer, they at home are getting it—and <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> days. But you will not have much <hi rend="italic">real</hi> summer until this reaches you! then your May (Hawthorn) will be in flower—and the children happy in the joyous returning season of warmth and sunshine and calm fine weather.</p>
         <p>Now I have two of your letters unanswered before me on my writing table! one of Sept. 19, and one of Decr. 13—to hand by last mail.—I have also to thank you for <hi rend="italic">seeds</hi>, by both letters: of flowers (Abyssinian Primrose, &amp;c., ) and of Savoy and Turnip. These latter are in the ground, with good hopes of their growing and turning to good account: of which more anon. I have a few seeds of some of our <hi rend="italic">minor</hi> plants for you, and I hope to get you some more next month, when I go over the hills and far away a-visiting the Country Schools; and, also, some of the Blue Gum (Eucalyptus) when ripe! which grow in the garden—some 50 feet high! Willie knows them well—having climbed them.—I am pleased to hear <hi rend="italic">you </hi>are Willie’s Banker; be sure you don’t allow him to draw all out too readily; of course I know, from him and from you all, that he is saving for a yacht,—all right! if he can do so—and if the said yacht is a sea-worthy one,—<hi rend="italic">and if he will not be</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">too venturous</hi>. I have promised W. an extra mite towards it (or her) to go hence per next mail.—You speak of <hi rend="italic">Ferns</hi>, I have a splendid fellow (<hi rend="italic">Cyathea medullaris</hi>) growing here in my garden just in front of the window, whence I see it every day: it is now—that is the long fronds—some 10–12 feet, growing in such lovely living elegant filigree-like arches, —more like a waving feathery palm than a fern! And then it is so surrounded by trees that it cannot well receive injury, blow high or blow low! But after all, in their native haunts in the forests is the place to see them in glory and beauty. I am glad that you have met with some of my works on N.Z.,—or on some of its productions. I gave up writing such for the Lexicon job—a <hi rend="italic">tough</hi> one and a <hi rend="italic">bitter</hi> one to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as it has turned out (see my Parly. letter) but never mind.—</p>
         <p>I sometimes think on you when I look at some of the many signboards which we now have stuck up at the Railway Stations, (I suppose a similar plan is carried out in England)—but it is the very neat clever artistic mode in which these are done and put out of hand that makes me think of you! For several years we had no good sign painter, nor imitation wood and marble painter, now we have both: the many and varied colours and tints which are used in these decorations please me much. I send you an Illustrated Australian Paper by this Mail. I do send w. generally every Mail, but Willie comes in for it—as his paper. I had from <hi rend="italic">two</hi> correspondents in England, the Xmas. No. of the Graphic and Illustrated News sent—but none came to hand! the old shameful story I fear—of being overweight and so seized at the London Post Off. I suppose Young Luff’s <hi rend="italic">log</hi> duly reached you—you don’t mention it. Yesterday till a late hour I was writing a long article on the <hi rend="italic">Crozet</hi> Island for our paper<note xml:id="ftn2-259" place="foot" n="259"> Copies of <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> for 1876 are missing from Papers Past. The Strathmore, en voyage from London to New Zealand, was wrecked on Crozet Island in July, 1875, and her survivors rescued in late February 1876. Their ordeal preoccupied the NZ press for several weeks.</note>—if printed in time I will send you a copy. This day a barque (the “Inverness”) has left us loaded with wool for Engld. and taking nearly 20 passengers. I looked at her with regret!—</p>
         <p>Talking with a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> newspaper runner last evening, outside the house, when he came w. the Evg. paper, I found that he was one of a family of nine! (the 3rd!!) they arrd. w. their parents two years ago, and the father died last autumn from fever—leaving the poor Mother w. 9 in a strange land. He got a bucket full of peaches, for his brothers and sisters, and as many as he could <hi rend="italic">well stow away</hi>. Peaches have been plentiful this season (they generally are) the heavy rains of January did not do them any injury, although the Apricots, Gooseberries, and early plums were destroyed.—Many bucketfulls have been given away here from this garden this season, and <hi rend="italic">more</hi> have rotted on the ground.</p>
         <p>If you can manage it: without <hi rend="italic">great</hi> trouble, I should like for you to send me a case (100 tin boxes, perhaps in a case) of the New Sardines,—or Pilchards put up Sardine fashion: I see there is a store at Mevagissey, and I believe one also at Newlyn near you. The <hi rend="italic">cost</hi> I will <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> remit with thanks, indeed I would send the amount now If I knew how much. If you send any—they should be “halve” (the <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> size boxes or tins), and of the <hi rend="italic">Best</hi> quality. It is a curious thing that some 25 years ago, or more, when I first saw Sardines here—I said they were much as young Pilchards, and I remember writing to my father about such becoming manufactured at Newlyn, and St. Ives. Moreover, if you send any make haste in doing so that they may find me here.</p>
         <p>I was much pleased to find from Willie’s last letter—that you were all together at Xmas. and were a merry party,—and—thought of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! My only fear has been for W., whether he could stand the cold of your severe winter; although I do believe that he had more of cold to suffer and endure on board of the “Merope” on his voyage to N.Z.</p>
         <p>The map of Cornwall you sent me (from W.) arrived all right! I thank you both for it.</p>
         <p>And now my dear nephew and niece I must close. Kiss the little dears for me: and accept my kind regards, and Believe me to be</p>
         <p>Your affect. Uncle,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Memo</hi>. of 4 small packets of seeds of N.Z. plants, enclosed in this letter.</p>
         <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Veronica Lavandiana</hi>, a pretty shrub, which does well in cultivation: 2–3 feet high. (Grows in the garden here)</p>
         <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Linum Monogynum</hi>:—a true Linum (or Flax), a shrubby plant, perennial, of neat growth, bearing largish white flowers ;—(grows on our hill-pathway from town.)</p>
         <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Angelica rosæfolia</hi>,—a shrubby plant having aromatic leaves; grows with preceding. (N.B. Both 2 and 3 like dry soils.)</p>
         <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Wahlenbergia gracilis</hi>, a pretty little blue flowered herb,<lb/>—but perennial. Sometimes called the “N.Z. Bluebell.” Grows with two last.</p>
         <p>W.Colenso.</p>
         <p>(Willie knows them all)</p>
