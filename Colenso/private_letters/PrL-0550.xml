         <p rend="end">Napier Nov 14/83</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>As your weekly mail hence leaves us tomorrow I <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
            <hi rend="underline"> </hi>write to you.</p>
         <p>I returned from the “Bush” on Wednesday 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> (night),and though I found your <hi rend="italic">prized</hi> letter &amp; “tin” here (with others) awaiting me, I could not possibly write to you by next mg mail.</p>
         <p>I had my usual “<hi rend="italic">luck</hi>” of <hi rend="italic">wet</hi>; I got there in driving rain w. S. wind, ri­ding, too, 6 miles from station in open express; &amp; out of 8 days there only 2 were really fine; however, I both endured &amp; worked, &amp; I got a few things I was in quest of; notably a new <hi rend="italic">Fagus</hi>, which I had detected in leaf only last year.</p>
         <p>Returning, I had to <hi rend="italic">work hard</hi>, to prepare, &amp; be ready for Monday nt, as I saw <hi rend="italic">all</hi> depended on me:—I did so; getting ready some of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> spns, &amp; worked <hi rend="italic">all</hi> day on Sunday too, from mg till nt,—also on Monday; but to little purpose; the rain poured here (just as in the Bush) and so it kept on all Monday; so that I only sent down one lot of dried plants (own &amp; others,)—&amp; went thither myself in the evening,very unwillingly. At first, we were only 3 (Dr Sp, Sturm, &amp; myself), near 8, a few others came in. Mr B, of Bank of N.Z. (your namesake) bringing his wife, Mrs May &amp; 2 other ladies—however we spent a tolerably pleasant evening, till 9-30, as I had lots of <hi rend="italic">pretty</hi> things to show. <hi rend="italic">To me</hi>, it was doubly melancholy, as, I could not help foreboding, it was propably my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> night!!!. (and so in conclusion, I gave them to understand.) You will see a brief (tho correct) report of our meeting in the D.T.</p>
         <p>I would rather than a £5 note, that the day had been fine, as I hoped &amp; worked for a large (last) meeting. I had cleaned &amp; labelled &amp; put up in fresh spirits, nearly 30 bottles &amp; tubes of animals &amp; plants, but at the last moment, I left the box (or two boxes) behind, which as it turned out was alright.</p>
         <p>Now to your kind, welcome, letter of the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. I would that I had a few correspondents <hi rend="italic">like you</hi>, such would cheer me up wonderfully. I am much <hi rend="italic">pleased</hi> in finding you do approve of my <hi rend="italic">rejected</hi> papers; two-three others have also done so; (as Mr Tanner, H.Nairn of Wairoa, Mr Oli­ver, &amp; Sturm), others <hi rend="italic">may</hi> yet do so; only a few have written to subscribe for the printing of the <hi rend="italic">rejected</hi> Ruahine papers, but among them, 1 from Wgn, &amp; 1 from Xchurch.</p>
         <p>You, my dear botanical friend and man of nature,—<hi rend="italic">you</hi> will understand me, when I say, I am at <hi rend="italic">home</hi> up in the woods; not so, here. Your tin with bottle and <hi rend="italic">Orchid</hi> in spirit pleased me much;<note xml:id="ftn3-206" place="foot" n="206">
               <hi rend="italic">Corysanthes papillosa</hi> Col.</note> if possible let me have more <hi rend="italic">flowers</hi>, fresh, put into damp soft &amp; clean Moss, in a box, match box will do—never mind leaves or roots. It <hi rend="italic">may</hi> prove to be a new spn. We have 4 or 5, <hi rend="italic">Corysanthes</hi>—curiously enough, the one I had so long sought, &amp; only got by going to the Bush in Sept, is very near to yours, but much smaller.<note xml:id="ftn3-207" place="foot" n="207">
               <hi rend="italic">Corysanthes hypogæa</hi> Col.</note> I should like also, to have a few spns of the wee little slender thing put up with it,—we have it here (from Petane), but yours <hi rend="italic">may </hi>prove to be distinct—it is smaller. The Fungus, in letter, is, I think, a <hi rend="italic">Rhizomorph</hi>; I should like to see more of it by &amp; by. I found it, in large broad masses beyond Tangoio, &amp; under bark in 1854. I fear it was overlooked by Hooker (with several other things of ours.) Am glad to hear of your dear little son being well. with very kind regards to Mrs Balfour &amp; to yourself</p>
         <p>Believe me Yours sincerely W. Colenso.</p>
