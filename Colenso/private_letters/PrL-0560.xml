         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour<lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Last week I received your letter of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst, &amp; sent off at once the latest Mudies Catalogue I had, to be in time for your mail; I had not time just then to write,—although I wished to do so. I have lots of other Catalogues, Booksellers, both new &amp; second hand, but I fear such would be of little use, unless you had one agent in London on whom you could depend; as it would never do for you to cull a book or two, &amp; then have to pay for separate parcels; besides (as I have often pro­ved) not unfrequently <hi rend="italic">the book</hi> selected has been sold. We have never or­dered from Mudie, and I think the Athenæum folks order from Smith &amp; Co, (I have none of their catalogues) which <hi rend="italic">might suit you better</hi>. I see in the paper that the Petane folks are about to borrow Smiths Cats, from the Ath­enæum, for that purpose.</p>
         <p>You can have 20 or 30 Catalogues from me,—if you have any means of send­ing for them; indeed I would post them, but I do not think they are worth the postage—that is, for any usefulness to you.</p>
         <p>I returned from Bush on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, &amp; I hope to go thither again <hi rend="italic">early next week</hi>, &amp;, if the weather keeps fine, I shall not return to N for some time The forest is <hi rend="italic">my home</hi>—there I have pleasant company.</p>
         <p>Hamilton, their new secretary was here last week about the books, papers, &amp;c, so now, I suppose, you may expect a <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> copy of my report, statement, lists, &amp;c. ere long; but I know <hi rend="italic">little</hi> of their doings.­ I find you are busy as you <hi rend="italic">always</hi> are like a good master and overseer—­hope this may find you and yours well &amp; hearty. I am tolerably so; I gained a few novelties again while in the Bush this last time (as I ge­nerally do), both Botanl. &amp; Zoological.­</p>
         <p>I shall send with this—or before I leave—some fruit of the Nikau Palm which you can sow—&amp;, I trust <hi rend="italic">reap</hi>—(not to cut down, but to obtain their benefits.)</p>
         <p>With kind regards    Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Wednesday mng. 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I had finished my letter to you last night, when P.D. arrived (8.15)—and ¼ hour <hi rend="italic">after</hi>—my man from P.O. with letters, the returned Catalogue from you. But why send it back? I do not need it. I can send a few Nikau seeds, &amp; 2 Karakas, &amp; hope they may grow. P.D. re­mained till 10.30. He is getting very stout.</p>
