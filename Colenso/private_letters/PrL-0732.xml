         <p>“Grow also in Grace,”—and learn to feel the life of Christ to be the true one. <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> is everywhere, the just kind loving <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> and Father that Jesus spoke of, and notwithstanding countless oppositions He prevails.—</p>
         <p>With this I send you a little book, written by an English poetess: it is but a little one! but it is from <hi rend="italic">my own old library</hi>, one, that I have not infrequently derived mental pleasure from: and in it I put a small photo. of myself that may serve—in days to come—to bring to your remembrance an old man who highly respected you. I could send you instead a volume of more celebrated English poets—Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, Morris,—but I have thought, that a volume by a talented English Lady would be the more acceptable, or, at all events, more properly presentable to a young English lady.—And with the book a small chq., which may enable you to purchase better and more suitable books, or anything else that is good and useful.——</p>
         <p>With kind regards, and respects, and best wishes,—</p>
         <p>Believe me to be,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
