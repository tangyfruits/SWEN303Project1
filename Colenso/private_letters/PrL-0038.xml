         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I hope this will find you returned safely from Auckland to the bosom of your family, and with a lighter heart than when you went away. I have scarce a moment to spare, but I would not allow the opportunity to pass without writing a line. You are often in my thoughts, and I pray God to direct and bless you in all your matters: Cheer up, never despair! great afflictions have often befell many of the Lord’s chosen ones even when living close to Him—Yet He has ever proved His promises—who knows but that it may be yet with you as with Job, whose end, even in a worldly sense, after losing all, was better than the beginning.—</p>
         <p>Keep by Your Heavenly Father: go not to the right nor left of the <hi rend="italic">one narrow</hi> path: a <hi rend="italic">good name</hi> is better than riches. Listen not, my dear friend, to any devices of prudence, or expediency, (<hi rend="italic">falsely so called</hi>) which do not accord with the golden rule—the Word of God.—This only will give peace at the last. </p>
         <p>I would write more, but time is precious. With kind regards to Mrs. Mair and family.</p>
         <p>               Believe me</p>
         <p>                               Yours very sincerely,</p>
         <p>                                               W. Colenso.</p>
