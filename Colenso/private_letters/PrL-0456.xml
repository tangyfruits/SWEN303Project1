         <p>My dear Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>I hope you are quite well. I should like to write you a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> note, but as I fear you are very busy (Eng. Mail week) I refrain.—</p>
         <p>Just 5 words, however, I must jot down—to accompany enclosed clipping:—from it you will find we have 5 new members (&amp; 4 a little before), and our Council has decided, on my proposal, &amp;c., that I <hi rend="italic">purchase</hi> from your store the extra copies required for our new Members:—&amp; so I have written to Mr. Gore for <hi rend="italic">6 Copies</hi>, vol. xiii., please let me have them. I may also add that I quite expect I shall have to apply for <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, as I believe there will be several <hi rend="italic">other</hi> new members yet: you will see they are nearly all <hi rend="italic">our own</hi> “boys”, and (may I write it) my own writings in “Trans.”, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> our old Maoris have drawn them out.—</p>
         <p>We had a very good meeting last night—good attendance of both sexes, &amp; long at it.</p>
         <p>Do you purpose moving this way? I have a lot of nice spns. of <hi rend="italic">Bryozoa</hi>, &amp;c., I should much like you to see. Are you too busy to look at them (&amp; name &amp; return) if I send them down? I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours ever truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
