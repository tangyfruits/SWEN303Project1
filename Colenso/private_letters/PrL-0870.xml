         <p rend="end">Napier Friday nt., June 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.<lb/>1893</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>Having reached the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>nt. of this mo. I am writing to you—lest you should say— “a whole mo. &amp; not a line!” as usual I have had <hi rend="italic">you</hi> very much in mind, since I last wrote. My last was from Dvk. near end of May: I was detained there (partly weather partly being unwell—severe cold for 4 days caught in Ch. on Sy. mg. 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst.) until the 9<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. when I made my<hi rend="italic"> escape</hi>! <hi rend="italic">fortunately</hi>, for the snow fell pretty heavily on the next day in the Bush Dist.—even <hi rend="italic">here </hi>for ½ hour—true feather-snow! On arriving here I found yours of the 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. (w. <hi rend="italic">many others</hi>—a fortnight’s accumulation!!) have been very busy ever since—mainly writing—ansg. letters (and still a <hi rend="italic">lot</hi>—ever growing!) among other wtgs. 2 papers for Instit.—such having been promised &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">expected</hi>—forty. <hi rend="italic">ready</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I have been <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, on the whole, &amp; am very well <hi rend="italic">today</hi>—have gone out but little only 2ce. in town—(during 5 <hi rend="italic">months</hi>!) one of those times <hi rend="italic">today </hi>when I went so far E. as to see <hi rend="italic">your old premises </hi>(having heard of them from “Bob.”) &amp; was surprised to see the alteration—shall I say, Renovation? the ptg. off. a Restaurt. w. proper big letters &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">below</hi>—but (oh! the fun of the thing!) T. “Printing Off.” <hi rend="italic">still remg. above</hi>: &amp; “J. Sirus Taylor”, <hi rend="italic">2</hi> neat &amp; clean looking shops next—altogether wearing a spruce appce. As I suppd. your F. wd. <hi rend="italic">not </hi>be there, I did not cross over to see.—</p>
         <p>And what shall I attempt—<hi rend="italic">re </hi>town <hi rend="italic">news</hi>? Of Sup. Ct. doings you must already <hi rend="italic">know</hi>. How the Jury could let that <hi rend="italic">fellow </hi>Rees off so <hi rend="italic">easily</hi>, is a mystery to me: I quite expect R. will do much mischief yet.—I see, in Wdv. p.—his dear friend Haggen is wkg. for him, again. A great no. of “slips” all round my hill propy. have come down—w. the fences!! owing to <hi rend="italic">continual </hi>wet: 2 men (w. “Bob.”) steadily at it—for a whole month &amp; more—very <hi rend="italic">expensive</hi>—cannot be avoided. Tuke has had a <hi rend="italic">good </hi>social reception at ’Pukurau, maugre the <hi rend="italic">heavy rain </hi>that nt.; T. has had a <hi rend="italic">severe </hi>beginnings, “snow 2ft. deep—in drifts,” on his <hi rend="italic">first </hi>Sunday out—a ride from W—u to Ay. Clinton, thence Takapau—then bk. for S. 7 p.m. but have not heard from him since 7<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—Robertshawe taken w. Lumbago <hi rend="italic">severely </hi>on 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., confined to room—3–4 days, so I saw him not after 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. in Ch., he <hi rend="italic">did </hi>manage to take S. on 11<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—but <hi rend="italic">very feeble</hi>.—I fear he is still <hi rend="italic">ailing</hi>: Dr. Macallan wrote to me about him—since. Saw Revds. Paterson, Sidey, &amp; Fraser, in town today, all well, but <hi rend="italic">P’s. </hi>girl ill w. measles—like <hi rend="italic">most </hi>other children, T. &amp; cy., &amp; I suppose, <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>. Bp. called <hi rend="italic">last wk.</hi> (My. 22) wished me to help &amp; take Meeanee, 25<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, 7. p.m.—but how? if I went <hi rend="italic">must </hi>detain trap to bring me back: <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">If </hi>driver <hi rend="italic">would </hi>wait in wet &amp; cold!—So some Lay. R. had it: the Bp. taking Taradale mg. &amp; evg. &amp; P.tapu, aftn.! (I think he must have had enough of it on that day!) Canon Fox wished me to be w. them (Augustine’s) on Tuesday nt., 27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., anny.—it was a bad time of wind &amp; rain, but I went: a <hi rend="italic">very small Congn.</hi>, Hobbs preached: Bp. &amp; Dean also present, but ’mong Congn.—Cathed. Anny. last night, but I did not stir out. I got back <hi rend="italic">w. difficulty </hi>from Augustine’s on Tuesday.</p>
         <p>—I see Costall <hi rend="italic">is </hi>in D’s. old place: this I suppose is right. Stout, too, in H. again! this too, I hope, is right—but I don’t like his <hi rend="italic">unnatural </hi>fads! Sir W. Fox <hi rend="italic">dead. </hi>Grey (they say) unwell. What a sad thrilling affair that of the “Victoria”! when will (so-called) Xn. nations leave off war?</p>
         <p>I recollect your <hi rend="italic">not </hi>noticing 2–3 (or more) matters I wrote to you about, (<hi rend="italic">designedly omitted—permit me </hi>to say) <lb/>1. I asked, If you had got, or had<hi rend="italic">seen</hi>, Atkinson’s Critique on T.?—as if <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, I would have lent you mine. 2. my remark on the <hi rend="italic">bad </hi>ptg. of Williams’ Mao. Dy.—and this I find (apparently) <hi rend="italic">increased</hi>, through carelessness of Binder—in putting sheets togr. after folding &amp; lapping a <hi rend="italic">pale </hi>page on to a <hi rend="italic">dark</hi> one! I have had <hi rend="italic">plenty </hi>of that kind of wk., &amp; so I understand it; and it can easily be remedied. Here I stop.</p>
         <p>I have again been asked, to take up Ts. Dy.! one gentleman (of rank and honours &amp; learning) who wrote to <hi rend="italic">me </hi>about it,) laughs heartily at <hi rend="italic">that </hi>lot of puffs from <hi rend="italic">high </hi>&amp; <hi rend="underline italic">low</hi> in praise of T’s. book. I saw “Stanislaus” in town—he wished to stop &amp; talk: I sd. “too gt. hurry”, St. rejoined, “hear 1 thing—the <hi rend="italic">bond </hi>is paid”. I suppose, vol. XXV. will soon appear: I have recd. your <hi rend="italic">kind </hi>remembrance—copy of yr. own papers—<hi rend="italic">no time yet </hi>to look into them: lots books to hand—Rl. Sy. Linn. Sy. London (<hi rend="italic">ordered</hi>)—thumping vols from Genoa—<hi rend="italic">all unopened</hi>—here <hi rend="italic">in a pile</hi>!—</p>
         <p>Your last (4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>) much shorter than usual—a good sign, <hi rend="underline italic">If busy in P.O.</hi>—I <hi rend="italic">note </hi>your “important” P.S.—on <hi rend="italic">a scrap</hi>, you say—<hi rend="italic">re </hi>my going to Engd. “You thought such was impossible—from what I had <hi rend="italic">told </hi>you <hi rend="italic">re </hi>certain matters, &amp;c <hi rend="italic">there</hi>”.—What I had said to you—had reference <hi rend="italic">only </hi>to my <hi rend="italic">eldest </hi>son—who <hi rend="underline italic">alone</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, (&amp; <hi rend="italic">not residing</hi> in West of Engd.,) was, of all my large family &amp; connections, <hi rend="italic">against me</hi>!! filially of course! and I always largely supporting him!!!—“Tell it not in <hi rend="italic">Gath</hi>”, &amp;c.—–</p>
         <p>I hope you are busy—<hi rend="italic">i.e. profitably </hi>employed.—–</p>
         <p>I think I sent you a copy of my letter in “Herald” re “P.Progress”;<note xml:id="ftn3-647" place="foot" n="647"> Translations into Maori. <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 14 June 1893.</note> I did, I know, to Sir George.—–</p>
         <p>Rev. ___ Jones, Bapt. Mr., has sold off &amp; left Napier. Rev. ___ Douglas is now living here <hi rend="italic">in </hi>N., his sister being married. A Rev. A. Clark, from Hawera, W. Coast, is to succeed Tuke at <hi rend="italic">Taradale</hi>. F. Tiffen’s house in Cl. Sq., next to Infants’ School, is for sale. Measles very rife everywhere but <hi rend="italic">few</hi>, if <hi rend="italic">any </hi>, deaths.—</p>
         <p>I send you a heterogenous lot! <hi rend="italic">none </hi>to be returned.</p>
         <p>Kind regards—to Mrs. Harding, &amp; to yourself, &amp; much (old man’s) love to bairnies. Hope you are all enjoying health.—So good night!</p>
         <p>Ever yours sincerely—</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I had forgotten to mention, that yesty., a tall big elderly man, large staring eyes &amp; yellow countenance, altogether strange-looking, sat opposite to <hi rend="italic">me </hi>at the long narrow Ordinary Dinner table—at 2 meals he never spoke: today I heard it was Pope the Maori School Inspr.!——–</p>
         <p>In “Herald” of yesty—Dinwiddie &amp; Co. had, as usual,— “with this morning’s Herald we issue lithogl. plan of lands to be sold by Lyndon” &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">No plan ever comes to the </hi>Cy. w. the “Herald”, so I wrote <hi rend="italic">D. </hi>a post card <hi rend="italic">re </hi>same, saying, it is a fraud on the propr., &amp; injury to auctionr. &amp; themselves in so <hi rend="italic">acting</hi>—at same time I <hi rend="italic">know </hi>the cause (P.O.) for D. had told me; but it should be altered, &amp; can easily be managed: I suppose I shall get it!</p>
         <p>I send you w. this copy of “Standard” contg. Orthogl. list of Geographl. proper names, also, a long Editl. on same. I set it aside for you a week ago, knowing how much it would interest you, but I did intend to read your own paper, again, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>—&amp;c—–but I will no longer detain it. When you have done with it <hi rend="italic">please return it to me</hi>. W.C.</p>
