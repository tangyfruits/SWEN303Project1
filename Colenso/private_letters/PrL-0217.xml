         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I called at your office this morning, hoping to see you—I wished just to tell you (in confidence) what I heard from Tareha on Saturday last.—</p>
         <p>I fell in with him at the Spit—on my way to Petane to vote for Parsons.—I asked him when the <hi rend="italic">hui </hi>was to take place at the Wairoa, &amp; if he &amp; other Heretaunga Chiefs were going? He said, He supposed they should go <hi rend="italic">with </hi>you—but that they would rather be <hi rend="italic">specially </hi>invited by the Wairoa folks—adding, “Kei te mohio ano koe ki a matau tikanga.”—</p>
         <p>Of course I don’t know when you may be going thither, but it does seem to me (if time would now permit) that it might be advisable to bring this so-called <hi rend="italic">special </hi>invitation about.—</p>
         <p>There <hi rend="italic">appears </hi>to be some amount of dissatisfaction about Tareha; &amp; I don’t think he would have spoken so very freely had he not just had a glass somewhere.</p>
         <p>Pray excuse this: it may be wholly unimportant.</p>
         <p>     I am</p>
         <p>             my dear Sir</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                             Wm Colenso.</p>
