         <p rend="end">NAPIER <lb/>WEDNESDAY NIGHT<lb/>SEPT 15/86</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour<lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I am still here, detained like some of the old sailing craft by head winds; I was to have left for the Bush last week, but the weather was so altered—cold and wet—that I put it off till this week (tomorrow Thursday), but the weather being much the same (though today it has altered for the better) that, on Tuesday night I wrote I intend deferring my visit thither till Tuesday next. I had also received letters from the Bush, informing me of hail, rain, snow, &amp; cold up there—and the woods are not pleasant in wet and cold weather.</p>
         <p>Last Saturday, Hamilton, knowing I was <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, came to see me about Mondays Society Meeting, when I agreed to read one of my (3) Botanl. papers, consequently I went thither on My. night in the rain and wind. Very few were present (only 8 I think, members) which was not to be wondered at, considering the state of the weather, &amp;c. However we had a very fair meeting, as to interesting matters, &amp; did not break up till X. I caught cold <hi rend="italic">there</hi> (not in going in the rain, nor in returning, but) in sitting so long a time in the large cold room, thinly clad, too, for I was obliged to take off my wet cloak, &amp; this has made me uncomfortable &amp; brought on Rheumatism. You will see in “Herald” (also “E. News”) a fair <hi rend="italic">short</hi> account of our meeting; among the new Fungi are 1 or 2 from Glenross, though imperfect—of which more anon. Heath (Master of High School) was rather severe in some of his questions respecting them, viz, of what good (monetarily)—as medicine—as food,—&amp;c, &amp;c. I pointed out the (already) great commercial value of <hi rend="italic">Hirneola Solytricha</hi>, which <hi rend="italic">a few years ago was of no account</hi>, &amp; now worth (as per Customs) £20,000 a year,—and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> yet be with some others; on his reiterating his questions, in another form—I replied, winding up by saying—it was the failing of this age or generation <hi rend="italic">only to care for</hi> the almighty dollar &amp;c,—which I regretted to see,—(I had p 34 of my pamphlet “3 Literary Papers” in mind, I suppose you had a copy, just look there). I returned to my abode here, cold and wet and not comfortable. On my coming in, lighting my candle &amp;c, lo! on the table were some letters my man had brought up from P.O. &amp; among them a very good, and most welcome one from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—which I was glad to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>, and when I read (especially your nice fitting extract from an old letter of 120 years ago) I <hi rend="italic">just cheered</hi>—insomuch that I gave your letter a Hieland welcome. I thank you heartily for it, also for the the <hi rend="italic">Hepatica</hi> enclosed. I have today been overhauling the <hi rend="italic">fine tangled lot</hi>, &amp; if you can send me some more from same tree, by &amp; by, do so, as perhaps in a month or so they will be bearing fruit, &amp; then I shall be able to say more about them.</p>
         <p>I do not think I shall be inclined to rear, or keep, any more living Lizards. I have really not the time to spare to attend to them, besides, mine, (in fact) have died from starvation, and to me it is distressing <hi rend="italic">so</hi> to keep a poor animal. My fine spotted mother died, a short time ago, &amp; (strange to say) its pretty little bairney has not yet eaten anything (though 3–4 weeks old) &amp; must follow its dam. I have given it flies but they are too large, &amp; are not the proper food,—I have no little ones—<hi rend="italic">with willing hearts and sharp eyes and willing hands—</hi>to aid, and assist.</p>
         <p>When you next write, tell me where the <hi rend="italic">Madotheca</hi> grew, on cliff side, or on tree.</p>
         <p>This month has been a rather trying one for me—in many ways. I may mention to you a disagreeable letter from the Govt <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Mao. Lex. they decline (or ignore) my proposals made to them, which they had sought, &amp; they will not pay me anything for my heavy work of last (part of this) year, neither for outlay to Maoris, &amp; others. <hi rend="italic">Kindly</hi> informing me—that in their opinion I have had a large amount of public money, for which the Colony has had no eqivilent return, yet still wishing ?? for the speedy publication of the work—offering me clerical assistance (which they already have seen is of no present use to me) &amp; reminding me, that the offer is still open for me to go on (as I did last summer) unto the end—when they will bring before the House the work, &amp; be prepared to support Equitable remuneration, &amp;c, &amp;c. However they have got my reply “short and sweet”. I hope they will not bother me again, it is the old old story.</p>
         <p>But I must close. Try to make out my meanings. My head is hot, confused. I purpose being absent (say) until 6–7 October, so if you write, address to me at Norsewood, and so save the double postage.</p>
         <p>             With very kind regards</p>
         <p>                             Believe me, yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
