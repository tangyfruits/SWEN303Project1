      <p rend="end">Penzance<lb/>April 23rd. 1834,</p>
      <p>Respected Sir,</p>
      <p>When in October last I left my native town for London, next to the regret of leaving family and friends, I think, was that of leaving the Institution of which I was a member.</p>
      <p>Having accepted the situation of Missionary Printer to the C.M.S. in N.Z. the Institution immediate1y occurred to my recollection, and my spare time I said should be devoted to furthering the interests of it. Specimens of the Botany, Geology, Ornithology, Entomology, Conchology and Icthyology of that interesting portion of the Globe it was my intention to transmit at every opportunity to the Institution.</p>
      <p>Judge than, Sir, of my surprise at being last night refused admittance, although I stated that I had been a member— that ’twas only in consequence of my leaving for London, that I had not continued as such.</p>
      <p>I gave my name, but ’twould not avail, because I, who was only home for a fortnight, had no Ticket. Had I known that such a strict rule prevailed I could have provided one. Whether the doorkeeper over-stretched his official authority or not, I cannot tell.</p>
      <p>Still, Sir, my leisure time, when in that distant land, should God spare me health and strength, shall be partly devoted to the enrichment (if possible) of the “Penzance Institution.”</p>
      <p>I am, Sir,</p>
      <p>Yours most obediently,</p>
      <p>W.C.</p>
