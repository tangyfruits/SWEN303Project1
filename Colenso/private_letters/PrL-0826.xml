         <p>Dear Mr Yates</p>
         <p>I duly received your note of the 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. with its accompanying specimen of blight—this time in good preservation. Being <hi rend="italic">doubly </hi>busy (it being Easter season &amp; having to go to Woodville on 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., with outgoing Eng. &amp; Amer. Mails shortly leaving, and, as I said before, no books of reference nor microscope at hand,) I despatched your box with a note to my good friend Mr. Maskell at Wellington, who is well-known as an expert in <hi rend="italic">these </hi>objects. I received his kind reply last night and I lose no time in making an extract for you.—He says—</p>
         <p>“The blight is an Aphidian insect of the family <hi rend="italic">Aphids</hi>. It appears to be so close to the European <hi rend="italic">A. cardui, </hi>Linn., = <hi rend="italic">A. chrysanthemi, </hi>Koch, that I would put it in that species. The slight differences in colour from the type are not of any importance.</p>
         <p>“This insect is common on Chrysanthemum near Wellington.</p>
         <p>“I think you should advise your friend to give his plants <hi rend="italic">copious drenchings of soap-suds</hi>, and he will do well to add to them some tobacco-water, any common tobacco will answer.”—</p>
         <p>I returned from Woodville on Monday afternoon, after 3–4 days of wet &amp; cold there: the same here. However I am keeping pretty well; but owing to weakness, &amp;c., in feet and ankles (dregs of Influenza!) I cannot venture into the woods close by nor walk far. Kind regards, Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
