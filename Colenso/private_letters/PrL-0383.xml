         <p>Mr Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have been going to write to you <hi rend="italic">often of late</hi>—in reply to yours of the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>—but have put it off, having had much to do.</p>
         <p>And now I am leaving today for 40 m Bush—to spend a few days in the sublime forests; to <hi rend="italic">recruit.</hi> I do not intend to return until say 3rd March.</p>
         <p>Enclosed is your chq. I must tell you <hi rend="italic">why.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The “Van Dieman” ship w. our books has arrived at Wellington, and I (in looking through the invoice—which I have lately sent to Kinross, to pass the case at Customs, when it arrives) I found that instead of Hookers Flora Hand Book of N.Z. Vols I <hi rend="italic">and </hi>II—there has been sent out parts (or Vols) II <hi rend="italic">only</hi>!!!. Vexed indeed I am but there is no help for it; as soon as I get the case here, I will write for Vols I &amp; have them out by mail.</p>
         <p>But I have now something better,—I find that the work instead of £2.2.0 (as I had supposed) will be only £1.1.0.</p>
         <p>Thanks for your specimens—of which more anon.</p>
         <p>I am obliged to write to England &amp; elsewhere at <hi rend="italic">this</hi> time, so am hurried a bit.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are all well</p>
         <p>     I am Yours truly</p>
         <p>             W. Colenso</p>
         <p>The Report of H.B.P.I. is in the printers hands.</p>
