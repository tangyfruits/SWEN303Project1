         <p>My dear Dr de Lisle</p>
         <p>Your esteemed note of 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst. has found me <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and I reply at once. I have been in the “Bush” nearly 3 weeks (leaving Napier soon after the election) and have received many notes and letters during my stay—but yours <hi rend="italic">surpasses them all</hi>, in your kind—your high spontaneous consideration of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! I don’t think I shall ever forget it.</p>
         <p>You give me good news—“glad tidings” <hi rend="italic">also </hi>in the house of de Lisle at this festive season in the birth of a fine son on Xmas. eve! Good” <hi rend="italic">bien bon</hi>! coming at such an auspicious moment we will take it as a good omen of the future: and most sincerely do I join you and Mrs. de Lisle in your true and proper rejoicing: may <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> bless &amp; keep the babe.</p>
         <p>You wish for two things: (1.) “a suitable and pretty Maori name” for your valuable Xmas. box: and (2) that I would consent “to stand Godfather at his Baptism.”—–</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">former </hi>I will do my best to carry out: the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi>, I fear, <hi rend="italic">is beyond my power</hi>, (unless Dr. de Lisle can insure me, <hi rend="italic">at least</hi>, 10–12 years of life!) as the <hi rend="italic">solemn charge to the Godparents </hi>given at the Baptism, and <hi rend="italic">binding them to act</hi>, precludes, I fear, this very old man from daring to take that duty on him.—</p>
         <p>But I will call on you early next week, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the name, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I purpose leaving tomorrow, and <hi rend="italic">may </hi>arrive at Napier on New Year’s-Eve. I travel now to keep my appointment with Mr. Welch for next Sunday; had I not made that appointment I would stay longer <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, being desirous of getting rid of the remainder of my old obstinate cold and cough: I am much better since I came hither, being a firm believer in the beneficial effects of mountain (or high altitude) air in chest complaints.</p>
         <p>Please make my respects to Mrs de Lisle: and with kindest regards to yourself (and kisses galore from you to your newborn son), Believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
