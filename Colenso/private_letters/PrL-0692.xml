         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>Tuesday Night, <lb/>Nov. 13/88.</p>
         <p>Mr. D.P. Balfour <lb/>Glenross.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Possibly—in the midst of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> busy harvest-time you may have had, now &amp; then, a wandering momentary <hi rend="italic">thought this way</hi>.—or in other words, expecting some reply to your letter of Octr. 27th—now before me. Notwithstanding your Direction outside—it was sent on to me at Dannevirke.—I went thither (or, to Waipawa, where I spent 2 nights on business) on the 24th., and on the evening of my arrival at D the rain <hi rend="italic">stormy</hi> S. wind began, &amp; continued (with very trifling intermission) during the whole of my stay—10 days. I got <hi rend="italic">there well</hi>—but the rain &amp; wind brought on a <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> return of my old Rheumatism—so that I could scarcely sit to write, or to a meal; indeed I told the landlady <hi rend="italic">on leaving</hi> (Monday 5th inst.)—that my breakfast that morning was the <hi rend="italic">only meal</hi> I had there eaten <hi rend="italic">without pain</hi>! I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to come back to <hi rend="italic">important business</hi>; also, for the meeting of H.B.P.I. held last night &amp; right glad am I <hi rend="italic">that it is over</hi>! for I have been working myself to death to serve it—Sundays &amp; weekdays (&amp; nights), whenever I could, without intermission, and <hi rend="italic">I only finished at 5 p.m. yesterday</hi>; I was so pushed<hi rend="italic"> </hi>(through losing so much time in October) that on my return from Bush I wrote to Hamilton—<hi rend="italic">not</hi> to call during that week.</p>
         <p>Last night was a good one, <hi rend="italic">I wished</hi> you were present as your name was several times mentioned by me, re your specimens during the year, and I showed your <hi rend="italic">last Xmas</hi> stick, the black-birch w Loranthus, which excited no small interest.</p>
         <p>In your letter was a bit of a <hi rend="italic">wee</hi> plant—a specimen of <hi rend="italic">Dicksonia</hi>, long known.—It is of no use writing to you <hi rend="italic">now </hi>about anything of Botany; nor would it be right for me to tempt you in the midst of your serious &amp; proper duties.</p>
         <p>P.D. kindly looked in on me yesterday, still unwell, though looking well, if not getting <hi rend="italic">too </hi>fat? I had not seen him for <hi rend="italic">months</hi>.</p>
         <p>I purpose leaving for Dannevirke <hi rend="italic">next week </hi>&amp; also to remain there till Christmas. I love the <hi rend="italic">quiet </hi>of the <hi rend="italic">woods </hi>but I do not intend to do much (or <hi rend="italic">attempt </hi>to do much) in Botany this time. <hi rend="italic">Perhaps I may relinquish it altogether.</hi> I assure you, <hi rend="italic">I have felt worn &amp; tired</hi>; last night when I steered my <hi rend="italic">lonely</hi> course this way from Athenæum, at 10.45, I got hither with difficulty—of weakness of legs &amp; body—&amp; much <hi rend="italic">sadness of spirit.</hi> Can <hi rend="italic">you</hi> possibly understand this?</p>
         <p>             With kind regards</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly, W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
