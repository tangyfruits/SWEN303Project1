         <p>Dear Dr. Hector</p>
         <p>I hope you are <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> well, and that this may find you so.—</p>
         <p>My holiday (?) only began last week,—and I have been hard at work ever since, “on t’other tack,”—&amp;, among other matters, for you.—I send you enclosed a fair &amp; condensed account of our “<hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi>”, for the vol. of last year.—</p>
         <p>While writing it out it has occurred to me,—that you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> replied to my queries, which I had sent you: no doubt owing to your illness and absence. One of them you will find mentioned in the concluding paragraph of my report of Proceedings herewith:—it embraces—Copper-plate portraits of S. Parkinson, of <hi rend="italic">Taiota </hi>(the Hero of Cape Kidnappers), of the North Island N.Z. Chief to whom Cook first gave the seeds of the “Maori Cabbage” &amp;c.—(as mentioned in one of my Papers, which you have,) a near ancestor of the celebrated Henare Matua, &amp;c. &amp;c.  Then,<hi rend="italic">another</hi> qu. was, Could I obtain a <hi rend="italic">set</hi> of the vols. of our <hi rend="italic">Transactions </hi>(I paying for them) for Penzance Town Library,—my native twon, in Cornwall? There were other queries too, which I do not at present remember.</p>
         <p>May I request an early answer to these queries?</p>
         <p>Do not forget, that I am all but <hi rend="italic">alone here</hi>,—and (though <hi rend="italic">not young</hi>,) may become disheartened if not occasionally aided by you &amp; others at a distance: I hope not.</p>
         <p>I have some Ferns still to examine, which may prove new,—some, at all events. My Books, re-ordered, are in the “Khedive,” among them, Beddome’s Indian Ferns, £12.12.0”!! &amp;c, &amp;c,—</p>
         <p>Let me have a line from you.</p>
         <p>Believe me, Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. You may have noticed that I still keep myself a mr. of the Wgn. P. Society—although <hi rend="italic">here</hi> I have to pay the subs. for each of 2 sons as well as myself!—I do so, fearing <hi rend="italic">this may </hi>collapse some day!               W.C.</p>
