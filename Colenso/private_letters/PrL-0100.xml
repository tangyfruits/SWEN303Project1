         <p>Dear Mr McLean</p>
         <p>I send you with as little delay as possible the “Form,” filled in to the best of my ability.– – – –</p>
         <p>I regret your not having received any Papers, especially as I myself am in the same predicament. I have received a lot of goods (from England &amp; Wellington), but the <hi rend="italic">odd one</hi> (a “<hi rend="underline italic">Parcel</hi>”—as per Bill of Lading,) has not come to hand—and this, doubtless, contains both Letters &amp; papers: should it yet be found, &amp; there are Papers within I will send them to you immediately.—</p>
         <p>We send you a basket of Lettuces (in their leaves to keep them fresh &amp; cool) &amp; would we had something better.—</p>
         <p>I write in haste</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
      </body>
