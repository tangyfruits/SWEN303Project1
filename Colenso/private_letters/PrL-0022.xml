         <p rend="end">Paihia, Jany. 9/41</p>
         <p>E.L. Godfrey Esq.<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>On returng. last night from a visit which I had been paying to the Natives, on the Coast, I found yours of the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ult. awaiting my arrival.—</p>
         <p>I am happy to find that in the execution of the “Gazette Extraordy.”, I have, in any measure, been enabled to give satisfaction.</p>
         <p>In ansr. to your request—to my becoming Interpreter to the Land Commission at Russell—I regret (when I consider the absolute need of some efficient and disinterested person to fill that important office) that it is utterly impossible for me to assist you, for, as I said before, my present duties are more than I can (without the most strenuous &amp; unremitting endeavors) possibly perform.</p>
         <p>You speak, my dr Sir, of “an ample remuneration, &amp;c”—allow me to say, (whilst I trust I can both discern &amp; appreciate the motive that prompted the generous offer,) that neither pecuniary remuneration nor worldly honor could possibly have influenced me, in my leaving the Land of my Fathers, my connexions, &amp; prospects, &amp; coming to this country, to fill the situation which I at present do, and I trust, that such never will. In the little that I have been, or may be, enabled to do for H.M. Govt., Remuneration, permit me to remark, (unless circumstances with regard to myself sadly alter) I never wish to hear mentioned.</p>
         <p>I trust, my dear Sir, that you will yet find a fit person to fill the office of Interpreter on this important occasion.—</p>
         <p>I have written to Col. Secy., in conseq. of a Letter wh. I have recd. from the Secy. of the Com. of Misss., on the subject of my doing any future printing for H.M. Govt., wh. I have reqd. him to make known to His Exy. &amp; the Land Commissr.</p>
         <p>I am, My dr Sir</p>
         <p>With every respect</p>
         <p>Very truly yrs</p>
         <p>W.C.</p>
