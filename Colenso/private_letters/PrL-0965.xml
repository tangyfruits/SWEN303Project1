         <p rend="end">Napier, May 13/96.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir James Hector</p>
         <p>I suppose you may have received a copy of our Institute “<hi rend="italic">Report</hi>” for ’96 (a poor thing!) and if you have had time to spare looked into it,—and found they had elected me President (though absent) for this year.—</p>
         <p>Well: our opening meeting was on Monday night last. And I write now to ask, If in vol. XXIX “Trans.” for next year, you would publish the address? My main reason for wishing it to be in the vol., is to place on record what I have said of Mantell, and of Huxley (as Members of the N.Z.I.) especially the <hi rend="underline italic">latter</hi>: there are also a few new local matters worthy of preservation, and more particularly, a long &amp; strong (?) call to the young folks to show themselves lovers of Nature, &amp;c.—Our papers wanted publish it piecemeal—or, in a Supplement, but I don’t like that.</p>
         <p>Of course much that I have said <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Huxley is from the R. Sy. papers—which you also have. I remember his ship, “Rattlesnake”, (w. Hobson), being in the Bay in ’36: and I have felt the more inclined to do him justice—to bring him forward—seeing so many of the “gude” Ch. folks against him: and in my doing this I have also the support of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> old friend Sir J.D. Hooker.</p>
         <p>I purpose leaving for Dannevirke on Friday next, absent in Bush <hi rend="italic">all coming May</hi>. If you are busy (as usual), a wire of word of consent will suffice.</p>
         <p>I hope you are keeping quite well. Are you never more to be seen this way? At <hi rend="italic">present</hi> I am pretty well, but too much of flying Rheumatism during last two months.</p>
         <p>   Kind regards, Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>                   W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Should you <hi rend="italic">wire</hi>—do so to me<hi rend="italic">at Dannevirke.</hi>
         </p>
