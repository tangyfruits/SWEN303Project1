         <p rend="end">Napier, November, 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
            <lb/>1867.</p>
         <p>Dr. Julius Haast, F.G.S.,<lb/>&amp;c  &amp;c  &amp;c<lb/>Provl. Geologist,<lb/>Canterbury.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I cannot tell how sufficiently to thank you for all your kind favours. Yours of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Octr. I received only a few days ago, (<hi rend="italic">We </hi>only get steamers from Wellington thrice a month,) with enclosed synopsis of 6 Lectures. I hope you intend to have them printed, if so, get me put down for ½ dozen copies. I had previously received your letter of July 27 (which crossed, at sea, mine to you of same date), and your very valuable Reports, with maps, Diagrams, and Alpine Views, all which has exceedingly interested me—although I have now but <hi rend="italic">little</hi> time to call my own,—as I dig hard daily by sunlight &amp; candle light at my <hi rend="italic">opus magnum</hi>—Lexicon: (would that in so doing I could please! nevertheless, I try to do my best, and am working <hi rend="italic">con amore</hi>.)</p>
         <p>I am glad to find Dr. Hector remembered you with a copy of my little Botanical <hi rend="italic">brochure</hi>: I would the one on the <hi rend="italic">Maories</hi> had also been printed, but I hear <hi rend="italic">it is to be</hi>. Dr. Hector was here last week and is gone to Taupo and Northwards Gold-hunting, &amp;c. He only spent a <hi rend="italic">short </hi>hour with me, his stay in Town being very brief, although he had come overland from Wellington. I hope you will make a <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> work of the <hi rend="italic">Moa</hi>:—how I shall feast myself when I get that grand dish of your cooking! The Photographs will do much for you. I anticipate great things, as I see you are deservedly fortunate,working hard,—and have many great advantages in your noble province. I hope you have some real lovers of Science among you;—this way I fear they are nearly as scarce as the <hi rend="italic">Moa</hi>.—</p>
         <p>When you receive your parcel of Hochstetter’s work, remember me with a Copy—and be sure to let me know <hi rend="italic">all </hi>expenses—I will remit immediately in one sum for all.—</p>
         <p>I note you say— “I see your great Maori Lexicon goes on famously.” Ah! Have you read what is recommended in the “Hansard”? (last number, or next to it). That some of the House tried hard to stop it, by knocking off the vote—although Mr. Stafford nobly took my part.—One said, it was anything but fortunate it had been given to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, who could not do it: that he had seen my writings for Dunedin Exhibition, which were, alas! such things, &amp;c.—And now I am officially informed, that my work is to be inspected and reported on, as to its substantial progress (as if it were a House or a Barn), and that great doubts exist as to any vote being taken for it after this financial year.—Scant courtesy, I think: yet so it is: Heigho! “<hi rend="italic">Geduld überwindet alles</hi>”<note xml:id="ftn2-146" place="foot" n="146"> Patience overcomes all.</note>—as they say in your Father-land.</p>
         <p>I have received Copies of Part II of Dr. Hooker’s Hand-Book, and am much disappointed, as I sent him some hundreds of specimens of microscopical Crypts., during the last 3–4 years, and at which I worked very hard, <hi rend="italic">none</hi> are inserted. Depend on it we shall find plenty more <hi rend="italic">species novæ</hi> yet.</p>
         <p>I have more than once thought whether you had not some intelligent Native with whom I might occasionally correspond <hi rend="italic">in re Lexicon</hi>. Since you have mentioned Rev. Mr. Stack’s name, perhaps you would not object asking him, If he knows of any one, and could give his name, address, &amp;c. I have several at the N.—</p>
         <p>I am writing largely by this Mail to Dr. Hooker &amp; others, so you must please excuse brevity.</p>
         <p>Ever my Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours most sincerely</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
