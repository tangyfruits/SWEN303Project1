         <p rend="end">NAPIER TUESDAY<lb/>Aug 3—1886</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour<lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>At last I proceed to answer your kind &amp; long letter of July 16th which I should have done long ago, but waited, thinking I might hear from you in reply to mine of (about) 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, which I supposed reached you shortly after you had written to me.—For among other things, I supposed, I had told you in it of <hi rend="italic">my paper I had written</hi> for our society respecting the birth here of 2 young green lizards—with all the accompanying circumstances—to that paper (not yet read) but <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be next Monday?—I may add, by way of supplementary, some portion of your observations on the same subject. Curiously enough my 2 specimens dropped dead (or nearly so)—are <hi rend="italic">in their </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">fetal</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> envelopes</hi>, &amp; really looked pretty when fresh—coiled up—somewhat resembling the seed of a broad Bean in size and shape.­</p>
         <p>The “small packet of Hepaticæ”, came alright &amp; has given me some work—I do not know if you were aware that a <hi rend="italic">very small very wee</hi> portion of the lot was <hi rend="italic">Hepatica</hi>—it was nearly all Moss, but I found 3 or 4 wee tiny plants. It was closely allied to <hi rend="italic">Ingermannia humillissima</hi>, in my Botanl. papers in Vol XVIII, just issued (hope you have received your copy)—but, while closely resembling it,—I have made another sp of it, by dint of microscopical research. I should like more specimens, if <hi rend="italic">handy.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I was in town this morning, (I only go thither now about once in 8, 9 days, and then on business) but I called on Dr Spencer, our President, &amp; he wishes to get a few plants (roots), and seed of the little common <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi>; formerly it grew here on the sides if this hill, plentifully, but I fear it has been killed—you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have it near you on some bank, or slope, away from feet of stock, and so I ask you to send the Dr a few roots (they are little bulbs, &amp; very deep in the ground). If you can do so—you may also send them to me for him,—I said that I would write to you this day about them.</p>
         <p>I hope you are all well at Glenross; our winter is passing awa’ though it was cold here <hi rend="italic">this mg.</hi> I am looking forward to flitting to the Bush at end of this month. Not a word yet from Gov re Mao Lex!.</p>
         <p>My old friend P.D. has been here spending 2 nights with me, since my last to you. I am writing this in haste, as I have plenty to do just now; the old old song; with kind regards</p>
         <p>Yours truly  W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I do not know the proper days for posting to you, &amp; P.D. could not satisfy me, but I hope this may be in good time. W.C. </p>
