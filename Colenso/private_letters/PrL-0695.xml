         <p rend="end">Saty. 3 p.m.</p>
         <p>Mr Harding</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Thanks for fresh proofs!! which I have <hi rend="italic">struggled</hi> to read &amp;c (<hi rend="italic">very unwell </hi>yesty aftn. evening and night,—obliged to return to bed this mg., &amp; rose at noon.)—</p>
         <p>Thanks also for kind remarks, both <hi rend="italic">on</hi> them &amp; <hi rend="italic">in note</hi> of yesterday.<lb/>1. You are right<hi rend="italic">re </hi>relegating Anion poetry to Appx. (To <hi rend="italic">insert this</hi> was my main reason for printing this paper.)<lb/>2. I shall also add another illustrative Note—which may amuse, &amp;<hi rend="italic">instruct</hi> (<hi rend="italic">?</hi>)<lb/>3.<hi rend="italic">Re </hi>your fable from Æsop—Ape &amp; Dolphin—I only have Æsop in Gk. There can be little doubt that Æsop (if he wrote that f.) had Anion in his mind’s eye, as he lived soon after Anion’s adventure.—<lb/>4. You still err (a little) in the matter of Kae:—K. was<hi rend="italic">not </hi>a Chief (or <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Chief), and as a <hi rend="italic">great tohunga</hi> would be but <hi rend="italic">little </hi>known to the people of Motutapu—all ceremonies performed secretly—even the food for K—his eating, sleeping, &amp;c, on such occasions would be <hi rend="italic">tapu</hi>, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>I had “2 minds” to insert a note, both in origl. Ms. &amp; for pamphlet, to explain that qu. of Tinirau’s sister.</p>
         <p>That also is a correct view which you quote from Grey’s Bk. There are several versions of <hi rend="italic">Kae</hi>, which agree in the main.</p>
         <p>When you send me 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi> proof let me know how you stand for “Copy,” as I must look it out.</p>
         <p>Hope you may make this out.</p>
         <p>Yours truly                          W. Colenso.</p>
