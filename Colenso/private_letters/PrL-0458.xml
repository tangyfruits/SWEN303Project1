         <p>Mr J .Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your kind note of yesterdays date has quite surprised me; I fear it is of little use my calling you (for once) “naughty boy”­ or even by returning to you what you have enclosed, viz. your £8 Chq. But, I must ask, were you under a vow? or, did you not quite be­lieve me all I had lately written to you about?—However I can assure you, that it was only after twice reading your note, and there reading those words— “I can well spare it” and, “can pay it without inconvenience”—that I was obliged to give way and so keep it.­</p>
         <p>For my part I have always believed in the truth of the poets saying (and more so of late years) “An honest man’s the noble work of God”;—And now I can cheerfully say that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I have proved to belong to that class,—or small band. Never leave it my young friend. Yesterday, not intending to write to you this week, I put up two papers for you—just to keep you going, as it were. No doubt you will receive them with this—if river passable.</p>
         <p>Now to your Natural History observation, which I am pleased in obtaining.—1. Referring to the Lizard in your former note: ­I know they will drop their tails when laid hold of, but I never knew of their doing so without it; hence they, when caught, must not be laid hold<hi rend="bold"> </hi>of by their tails, but by the body. (I generally lay hold by the neck.) I would that Mrs Drummond had caught that two-­headed lizard,—even had she only taken it up &amp; closely examined. it; I would give £2 for such a creature. At the same time I have heard a similar story from Maoris, 20 years ago, but I never be­lieved them—as such a thing is not in nature; I had supposed, from knowing that when their tails were broken off another grew out, &amp; sometimes by the side (as it were) of the stump, that the appearance of this, at a distance, gave rise to the story.­</p>
         <p>2. You are right with regard to the “Walking sticks” in the Bush. There are 6 or 7 different species of them already known &amp; described (one fully 10 inches), indeed last year I descri­bed a new species, obtained from Hampden Bush,—but my paper (owing to waiting the receipt of a letter from Dr Haast of Christchurch) was not in time for being printed with the rest. See a notice of its having been read here, at page 457 Vol XIII and of the insects being known at page 456,—I hope my paper may be printed in Vol XIV.</p>
         <p>3. You have pleased me much with your “Velvety black Spiders”; but alas, I have only the bare smell of your pipe. You should have caught some &amp; put them into a wide mouthed bottle into a lit­tle whiskey; keeping the bottle well corked,—a bit of bladder tied over the cork is best.</p>
         <p>And now that you are a member with myself of our Society, I am going to ask you to do this for <hi rend="italic">us</hi>;—put all &amp; every insect you find that is new or strange, however small, into a little whiskey; &amp; do the same with lizards in a larger bottle. When I go inland in the Spring, I will take in bottles of proper spirits for the purpose.</p>
         <p>J. Stewart of Takapau, is already doing something for us; so is Balfour of Mangawhare.—and many others; I daresay that those spiders were a kind of trap-door spiders, which live in the earth; there is a long account of them in one of the back Volumes of the “Transactions”; those were observed and taken down S.</p>
         <p>With thanks, kind regards to all, and best wishes­</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I may tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (for I know that you will feel with me) that my stupid folks have managed to kill my tame lizards for me, while away inland; first of all (on one journey) my two reared ones; and then (on another journey) my big one; Many people from a distance, as well as from town, came to see them.
