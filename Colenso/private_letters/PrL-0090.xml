         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Wednesday night, July 24th 1850:—</p>
         <p>To the Ẁaretokopounamu, to Puhara.</p>
         <p>O Sir, greeting to thee; here is thy letter come to me, and great is my grief at the erroneous talk in it; that is, at thy word, That I must pay for this Station. O Sir, at the first I declared, that I never would pay for this place; and, again, afterwards, often very often, even down to the present time I have reiterated the same words.—Because, I cannot pay for it; this Station being a gift to the Church; and a gift is not a thing to be paid for. If thou wert a man belonging to the faith, I would speak thus unto thee, look at what was commonly done in former times;—(see Galatians iii. 15, in which Paul says,)— “Friends, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.” Now, O friend, this was the practice in former times, and it is the same now. The covenant for this station was settled long ago, on the same day that it was written, otherwise I should never have been sent here by the Bishop.—So much for that. Here is another word to thee:—be not angry; be not surprised, at this my word; inasmuch as thou hast both mocked and vexed me. Behold, O Sir, I give up those places inland, at Patangata &amp; Ngawakatatara, I give them up entirely. It is I, Colenso, who say this to thee; doubtless thou dost well understand. Seek not far off for the reason; thou art the cause; that is— “a double tongue.” Behold, here is my messenger now going inland to carry this news. O Sir, great indeed is thy want of wisdom to write such words to me. </p>
         <p>That is all of mine to thee, <lb/>From me, from Colenso.</p>
      </body>
