         <p>Secretaries,<lb/>C.M. Society,<lb/>London.</p>
         <p>Rev. &amp; Dear Sirs</p>
         <p>Enclosed is the Original of a Memorandum respecting a large Church Bell the property of the C.M.S.—which for a long time has been in my possession.</p>
         <p>When obliged, in 1862, (sorely against my will;) to leave Waitangi, I wrote a note to the Rev.S. Williams, informing him of my being about to do so, and requesting him to take charge of this Bell, and of some Maori Books belonging both to the C.M.S. and to the B.&amp; N.B. Society, but, as I did not receive any reply from him, I brought away the Bell and Books to Napier in my last cartload of goods.—</p>
         <p>Subsequently I have been often asked—both by the former as well as by the present Minister of our Church in this small town, as well as by some of the Congregation, to lend this Bell—which I have at length consented to do on the conditions expressed in the Memorandum.</p>
         <p>I may add, that I have this day written to Rev. S. Williams enclosing the <hi rend="italic">Duplicate</hi> of the within Memorandum (keeping the <hi rend="italic">triplicate</hi>): and, that I have from time to time, as disposed of, accounted to the B.&amp;N. Bible Society for their Books abovementioned removed hither by me. Some of the Books of the C.M.S. (Maori Pentateuchs, &amp;c.,) are still in my charge.—</p>
         <p>And, further, that if the C.M.S. could conveniently <hi rend="italic">give </hi>the said Bell to the Church of St. John’s, Napier, it would be most thankfully received. As a Congregation we have had to purchase a site for our Church and Parsonage, to build enlarge &amp; endow, and to maintain our Minister, which <hi rend="italic">altogether </hi>falls rather heavily to our small number.</p>
         <p>                                             I am,</p>
         <p>                                                             Rev. &amp; Dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>                                                     Very truly yours,</p>
         <p>                                                             Wm. Colenso.</p>
