         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>As your mail day is tomorrow, I must write you a few lines, if only to thank you for your last kind note of the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>, &amp; accompanying little box of bones, &amp;c.—Again have I gone over the fragments, &amp; can only wish we had more; among them, however, was another tooth (a molar); how strange it is that there is not a single scrap of a jaw, or of the skull. I have written to Dr Hector <hi rend="italic">specially</hi> about them—but I know he is very busy just now (after his 3 weeks in Auckland) getting out the Vol of “Transactions”. Should you possibly find any more of those <hi rend="italic">fragments</hi> don’t fail to secure &amp; send them. Your small veg. specimen has also interested me largely; I have examined it some ½ doz times (with powerful single lenses) but cannot make much of it­ save, that it is a <hi rend="italic">Lichen</hi>; but of what Genus or family, I cannot say, for want of its fructification—it being barren.</p>
         <p>Perhaps you could (at your leasure) send me some more of it. I suppose it grew on the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> branches of a tree, &amp; <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, often, several of our Dendroid Lichens assume peculiar starved, or stunted, or dwarfed appearances, widely differing from the normal plant, &amp; puzzling, too.</p>
         <p>Have you any <hi rend="italic">wet moorland like spots</hi> on your run, or near you?. Such as those peaty bogs at home. If you have, just look about there, &amp; see if you can fall in with some specimens of <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi> (Mosses);—they are generally tolerably large &amp; grow thickly, in beds, &amp; are often of a dead whitish-brown colour. I have rarely seen them here (H.Bay), though I did in undisturbed wet open holes, or hollows, on Ruahine They are more common at the N. but not common even there like they are at home—all over England &amp; Scotland.</p>
         <p>By this last mail I have received a large registered parcel of over 60 sorts from home, of <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi>; all British, and the kind donor wishes us to return. Not, however, that I am indebted to him for these, as I had sent him in December, a larger lot of our <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ</hi>, which I had just then painfully collected in 70 mile bush in the wet weather,—these, of his, I hope to show at our meetings,—only <hi rend="italic">it is a</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">task</hi> to do so to <hi rend="italic">uninterested</hi> folk.—At present, I have nothing (in the way of paper from any one) to bring be­fore our meeting, and, as I was saying to Dr Spencer our V.P. yesterday, it is doubtful whether we shall have a meeting <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">May;</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">bide</hi> a <hi rend="italic">wee</hi>. I suppose you will see a letter of mine in “Herald” yesterday,—and I have just sent them another for tomorrow—if they will publish it.<note xml:id="ftn3-138" place="foot" n="138"> The fever scare. <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald </hi>11, 13 April 1882.</note> Our <hi rend="italic">political</hi> news will surprise you. Hope you are all pretty well. I <hi rend="italic">still</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> to get away to the Bush <hi rend="italic">next</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">week</hi>—my last chance for the season; sickness <hi rend="italic">there</hi> has delayed my movements, and with kind regards,</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W.Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. Have you a <hi rend="italic">large</hi> Hotel up your way?, that rooms could be found for so many <hi rend="italic">ladies</hi> and gentlemen; You quite surprise me.</p>
