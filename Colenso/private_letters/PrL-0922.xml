         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have this day received a letter from Mr. H. Suter (now there with you), and a casual remark he makes in it is the cause of my now writing. I have <hi rend="italic">long </hi>known him, and we often corresponded at the S., &amp; lately I received a note of enquiry from him, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>shells, &amp;c., and, in my reply I said, (something like this,)—“Is there a copy of “Index Kewensis” there in the Museum Library? I have recently received vol. III, and yesterday, in writing to Sir J. Hector, I put this same question, and now I put it to you. Indeed, in a letter of mine last year to Mr. Cheeseman I asked him, but I have had no reply to my letter.”  And I now<hi rend="italic">suppose</hi>, Mr. Suter mentioned that to you; and now <hi rend="italic">he says </hi>(in his letter just received)—Mr. Cheeseman did <hi rend="italic">not </hi>receive such a letter from me last year. And so I am <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, again, writing to you.—</p>
         <p>I have long been wondering why I got no answer from you, particularly as my letter was a <hi rend="italic">long </hi>&amp; friendly one; and <hi rend="italic">with </hi>it I sent you papers, and <hi rend="italic">in it </hi>had offered you others, &amp; spns.—and <hi rend="italic">now </hi>I find (by chance) <hi rend="italic">you never received my letter. </hi>However, I am <hi rend="italic">glad </hi>to know this: and having kept a copy (blurred) of mine to you, I copy it <hi rend="italic">verbatim.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">
               <note xml:id="ftn3-718" place="foot" n="718"> This explains why the copy at Auckland Museum is endorsed “Copy” yet is in Colenso’s hand.</note>
            </hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>I also wrote, some time after, to Mr. Fenton, who kindly replied: and in Septr. I wrote to Mr. Peacock; I will send you the copy of my letter to Mr. Peacock, as it will give you more recent information <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the Maori Lexicon: Mr. Peacock’s reply (<hi rend="italic">hurried</hi>, I think,) I don’t exactly like. Please <hi rend="italic">return</hi> the copy of my letter to Mr. P.—</p>
         <p>It is rather a curious coincidence my <hi rend="italic">recommending </hi>Mr. Suter to you!—–</p>
         <p>   Trusting you are quite well, &amp; with kind regards—</p>
         <p>                   Believe me, Yours faithy., W. Colenso.</p>
