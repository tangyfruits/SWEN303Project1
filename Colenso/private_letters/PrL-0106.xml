         <p rend="end">Wednesday, noon,</p>
         <p rend="end">March 26/51</p>
         <p>My dear Mr McLean</p>
         <p>Your very friendly note of Thursday last duly reached me—and I came to this place fully expecting to find you <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, or that you had preceded me—in both, however, I am disappointed.—</p>
         <p>At present I can only thank you for your kind wishes, &amp;c.—I fear, however, that the prospect of my <hi rend="italic">continuing </hi>in this country is daily getting fainter—a short time will, however, decide. I firmly believe that things are rapidly altering for the worse in the district (as well as in others),—and I cannot remain to see the utter spoliation of my flock without having it in my power to do them the <hi rend="italic">least </hi>service. Much however will depend on <hi rend="italic">yourself, </hi>while you retain your present situation.—</p>
         <p>Since we last met I have heard much—a tithe of which I cannot write.—But 2 things I may mention, as these <hi rend="underline italic">appear </hi>to be beyond question,—first, that you have in some measure departed from the original expressed intention, of taking only those lands which were waste, &amp; then from the <hi rend="italic">rightful </hi>owners only; and, of standing by the <hi rend="italic">poor </hi>Xn. man, to preserve him from being beaten and brow-beaten by the Heathen Chiefs—and, second, that you told Hupata (when defending his right to his own, &amp; declaring that he would not part with his land, he having several children)—that he, as being only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> had no right to stand against the wishes of the majority!—</p>
         <p>These things I have plainly and faithfully written—they have already wonderfully operated against you (they may, I allow, be false),—and, although I have done what I could to allay the angry feeling—I can not but express to you that I have some ugly doubts which I could wish to be fully &amp; for ever rid of.</p>
         <p>Were I not friendly, &amp; Xtianly attached to you I should not write as I now do. And I hope you will forgive my blunt and rude way of expressing myself. —  —  —  —  —  —  — —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">This</hi>, is one of those places I once thought of as a somewhat desirable place for a residence—it is isolated &amp; in many respects suitable.—</p>
         <p>Mrs Colenso will gladly do what she can for you. <hi rend="underline italic">Do call</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A Dieu my dear Mr McLean—my heart is full.—</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic"> Ever</hi>truly yours</p>
         <p> W Colenso.</p>
