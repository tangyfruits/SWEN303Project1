         <p rend="end">Napier, June 26, 1867.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I feel much obliged to you for your kind remembrance of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst.—it seems to take one back to old times! You express a hope that “I may be able to drop you a line”—and you may see that I again gladly hasten to do so.</p>
         <p>Of course I had heard through the Public Prints, of your long absence &amp; journey &amp; privations—and, I fear, sufferings from a <hi rend="italic">dislocated</hi> shoulder &amp;c, &amp;c,—and if I had known your exact whereabouts I should have written to you. I am truly glad you have returned to Wellgn.— “come <hi rend="italic">home</hi>” again—&amp; hope you have secured lots of specimens. My neighbor here, Mr. McLean, had kindly lent me your 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. Report on the Coal Deposits, in which I felt much interested. I have even been a heretic towards the so-called orthodox origin (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) of Coal,—and think (empirically?) that the very occasional presence of veg. remains prove (to me, at least,) the very opposite  x  x  x. I would you had told me something of what you have found in Botany—of<hi rend="italic">sp. nov.</hi>—during your long absence in those unknown regions—but of all this I hope to hear anon.—</p>
         <p>I have just read a copy of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. part of Dr. Hooker’s Flora Nov. Z. (HandBk., I mean,) and confess my disappointment—although I have not yet gone deeply into it. I had collected—largely &amp; diligently—of the <hi rend="italic">smaller </hi>Crypts., etc., during the last 4, 5, years, and sent them, but <hi rend="italic">none</hi> are noticed therein. I have however received from Dr. Hooker a kind of synopsis of many of them, written by Leighton (of Shrewsbury), just sufficient to show several of them to be new—some to N.Z.—some to science,—a few of the latter have been lately named by Nylander. In many instances, however, Leighton has merely given the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>—which I knew before.</p>
         <p>I am glad to find from yourself &amp; from Dr. Eccles, that he sent you my note of enquiry about the essay on the Maoris: but, I fear, you are mistaken in supposing it to have been printed, as Dr. E. says (to me) it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. (Several are, as I find from MacLean.) If you have the means and if it is worthy—or, if it is to be printed at all, pray do get it done.</p>
         <p>It is so long since I last heard from, or wrote to, you, that I scarcely know exactly when it was. I think it was during the last Session &amp; not far from this time. I know I was then suffering from a bad hand, which, after many weeks of misery, ended in total loss of right forefinger (anchylosis) now rigid. This threw me out considerably in all my little works and plans. I had to learn to write <hi rend="italic">sans</hi> forefinger, as well as thumb. And lately again I have not been very well—but hope to be better ere long.—</p>
         <p>I have been working <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> at Lexicon, and I find it harder work <hi rend="italic">every way </hi>than I had conceived it to be: still I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> (D.V.) accomplish it. [<hi rend="italic">Entre nous</hi>: I have had more or less of difficulty with the “<hi rend="italic">Department</hi>” about it:—difficulty in getting the salary (£100., net, per ann.)—which however I eventually got up to Decr. last: difficulty in pleasing, &amp;c., &amp;c., so that I have lately been <hi rend="italic">told</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">offy.</hi>, that no further vote will be taken until the Govt. is assured of its <hi rend="italic">substantial</hi> progress (!) and this the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>year!! This I have officially welcomed—only, I have said, let my examiner be some one who is a fair judge of <hi rend="italic">brain</hi> work, and neither a pol. nor ecclesl. foe. It may be better—<hi rend="underline italic">if I cannot please</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> the ever-changing powers</hi>, to have the Govt. aid withdrawn; but I shall strive hard to please, as I really wish to do the Work, and I cannot well do it without the allowance. As early as ’63, I saw &amp; pointed out, it would not be well to have it under a “<hi rend="italic">Department</hi>”. Can <hi rend="italic">you </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">quietly</hi> help me in any way in this matter? now that the Assembly is about to meet—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> if help should be needed.]<note xml:id="ftn2-139" place="foot" n="139"> This paragraph has PRIVATE written across it.</note>
         </p>
         <p>I am thinking of visiting Wellington in the spring, &amp; may, <hi rend="italic">during the Session</hi>, if I can have free admission to the Genl. Assembly Library. I think such was the rule, or privilege, formerly at Auckland to ex-members of the Ho. of Reps. (ask Domett).—Perhaps you would not object to asking Major Campbell some day when convenient,—whether such is the rule, or allowed, now. Please also remember me most kindly to him.—But I should seek it both as an ex-m., and as a person employed on a Literary Work for the Govt. under a resolution of the House. It would suit me better to be at Wellington <hi rend="italic">during</hi> the Session, as then some stranger natives may be also drawn to the Capital, of whom I could make many enquiries. If I visit you I shall expect to regularly ransack your museum—being free from <hi rend="italic">political </hi>Chains: as I scarcely saw anything last time.</p>
         <p>Dr. Eccles is on some Botanical work—but he has not told me clearly what.</p>
         <p>I send (to you) a packet of seeds for Kew, pray frank &amp; forward it for me. By Papers per last Eng. Mail (<hi rend="italic">Suez</hi>) I find Dr. Hooker has published a paper in the “Popular Science Review,” on “<hi rend="italic">The struggle for existence amongst plants</hi>,” particularly noticing our N.Z. Flora:—have you seen it?—</p>
         <p>Tell Gisborne, not to forget to forward me my <hi rend="italic">4</hi> Copies of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Part of HandBook: be sure to give him my best respects.—</p>
         <p>Remember me also very kindly to Mantell—I have to thank him (or you) for copies of Indices to Part I of HandBook—Maori &amp; Lat.—which were really wanted &amp; are very useful. I hope he likes his seat at the City <hi rend="italic">Board</hi>! albeit tough joints &amp; short commons! Always glad to hear from you. Believe me, my dear Sir, ever very truly yours</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso</p>
         <p>Slight earthq. this evening: Bar. 30.45 4 p.m.</p>
