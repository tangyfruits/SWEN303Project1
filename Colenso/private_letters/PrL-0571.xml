         <p rend="end">Napier Tuesday night <lb/>Aug 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1884</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I did not intend—, or rather I found I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not well write to you this week, &amp; so I posted a <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> paper to you—2 days ago with a slip in it; hoping for luck in my passing on a <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> paper, that it would make alright. Having so many parcels to make up (over 30 for England &amp; Europe alone) &amp; letters to write, &amp; the mail closing Thursday instead of Saturday, I have been regularly hard worked. Sundays, Mondays, night &amp; day!!! However this mor­ning, while at my writing, my man brought up from town your prized letter of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>—both welcome &amp; refreshing, &amp; so must e’en set aside my Home letters &amp; write to you. It has <hi rend="italic">again</hi> gratified me to find <hi rend="italic">you</hi> agreeing with me (which has also happened before), and, shall I say, liking the little book.—On this occasion <hi rend="italic">doubly</hi> so—because you are a member of the Inst &amp; now you may read and think why those papers were “so sat upon” by that ir­responsible Board of 3 at Head Quarters!. Then, as to your <hi rend="italic">experience</hi> of thrilling awe when on the mountain tops alone &amp; meeting those menancing masses of clouds!! <hi rend="italic">this is capital</hi>! Now, I well know, (if I had dared doubt before) of your sympathising with me generally. <hi rend="italic">Good</hi>. Yours is (at present) the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> letter re the book! from H.B. folks (save a short &amp; courteous one from my neighbour Mrs May, but <hi rend="italic">then</hi> she had not read it). H.S.Tiffin cros­sed the street in town to <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> me before others, how much he was pleased with it, so that he sat up all night to read. But on Sat night I received an excellent letter from Sir G. Grey, saying he had read it with great inter­est, highly approved of it in both literary &amp; scientific senses &amp;c, &amp;c, (almost too much praise) &amp; to send his remaining copies (4) on to him at Wel­lington, as he wished to distribute them to the Pub Libraries, &amp; to write my name in the one for Auckland, &amp;c. I had sent 2 copies on board of his steamer for him, when she called on her way S. Here is a man up to his neck in politics at this crisis, &amp; yet <hi rend="italic">finds</hi> time to write to me!!! With this, another copy will be sent to you; their price (stipulated in the advt) is 4/-.—Ought to be <hi rend="italic">more</hi>—as 4/- will not pay (that is Craig, who got over 50 subs must have 25% for mere selling). I had only intended to go so high as 60 pages for that 4/-, but as the work was proceeding I was determined it should be done well on our part. There are a few copies over, which will be 5/- to non-subscribers, but any original subscriber, is to have them at 4/-. Curiously enough Rev D Sidey sent in his name <hi rend="italic">2 days too late</hi> (&amp; the <hi rend="italic">Bp, only at the last moment.</hi>)</p>
         <p>I like your Fungus—think I know it, or its Genus; let your dear little son, (my boy) watch it, &amp; <hi rend="italic">send</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">me a few more as they ripen—</hi>these are young but good; My next letter shall be on this &amp; other Fungi</p>
         <p>With very kind regards to <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Bel. me</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. It has occurred to me to say,—&amp; do not be offended w. me,—that as you <hi rend="italic">may </hi>have forgotten Latin, through disuse, if you wish it, I will send translations of the new sentences.</p>
