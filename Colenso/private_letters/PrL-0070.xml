         <p>R.C. Gunn. Esq.,</p>
         <p>&amp;c, &amp;c,</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="underline">Launceston.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>An opportunity offering of sending Letters from this out-of-the-way place to the Capital (which is, indeed, a <hi rend="italic">rara avis</hi>!) I eagerly embrace it, to tell you how very much I am indebted to you: and to thank you for all your kindnesses. Your two kind Letters—the one, dated 6 Jany./45 (!!), the other, July 1/47—with the box of pamphlets, &amp;c, arrived here <hi rend="italic">together </hi>last month!!—The box, I believe, napped by the way both at Sydney and Wellington.—And even now I do not know whether you received a Letter from me containing a Bill of Ex. for ₤<hi rend="italic">10</hi>.—which (to ensure as far as possible its reaching you) I sent in Duplicate,—the origl. in January, &amp; the Duplicate in March of last year,—as you do not mention in your last of such having reached your hands.—</p>
         <p>I am greatly obliged to you for the many <hi rend="italic">Serial </hi>works with which you crammed the box; but, I fear, you have been depriving yourself to your own disadvantage. I have—even here—a tolerable share (comparatively speaking) of Botanical works, in D’Candolle’s Prodr.—Kunth’s Enumerat. Plant.—Brown’s Prodr. Flora Nov. Holl.—Forster’s Gen. Plant.—Don’s Gen. Syst. of Bot.—most of Lindley’s &amp; Hooker’s works,—Newman’s Brit. Ferns, and the different Bot. periodicals of the day, together with what may be the last ed. of the Encyclop. Brittanic. How I am to make a step towards the shadow of a return, I scarcely know at present. I shall, with pleasure, send you specimens of N.Z. plants, and some other things, but I shall first have, I fear, to test your patience largely. For, not to mention the <hi rend="italic">difficulty </hi>of our speedily corresponding, &amp;c., my time is so taken up that I am often at my wits’ end, and always in arrears. And then, living as I do (for the present) in a Raupo (<hi rend="italic">typha</hi>) house, which swarms with insects—such a devouring multitude!—I am necessitated to pack up every thing directly (after culling them for Hooker) as securely as possible, intending so to leave them until his work on the Flora of N.Z. shall be finished, when I hope once more “to break bulk”, put my Herbarium to rights, and remember my friends. By which time, too, it is possible, I shall be in a more permanent dwelling, where my treasures will be for a time rescued from the devastating multitude which now surrounds me.—</p>
         <p>I mentioned (I think) in my former Letter, the immense size of my parish—larger, in fact, than many English Counties—and the consequently scattered state of my charge, so that my time is in great measure, consumed in painful &amp; dangerous travelling. Last year, for instance, I was absent from home, journeying about, 205 days! One good, however—at least, for science—results therefrom; I am enabled to gather together much more of the flora of the Country for our friend, than he could ever possibly have received any other way—and thus I shall be able to do my share towards the making known the curious Botany of this hitherto little-known part of Colony. During the past year, in particular, I have made several pleasing discoveries. Among my novelties are some ferns,—<hi rend="italic">Lomaria, Gleichenia, Lindsæa, Adiantum, Dicksonia, Cyathea, Cheilanthes, ?Caterach, Grammatis, </hi>&amp;c: some Taxaceous and Labiate plants: several Orchideous and other Monocotyledons: and not a few <hi rend="italic">Compositæ, Umbelliferæ, Myrtaceæ, </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Aralaceæ</hi>: while the genera, <hi rend="italic">Coprosma, Veronica, Myosotis, Plantago, Epilobium, Pimelia, Loranthus, Dracophyllum, Cardamine, Clematis, Carmichælia, Fuchsia, Oxalis, Acæna, Rubus, Viola, Suttonia, Gaultheria, Olea, Elæocarpus, Ranunculus, </hi>and the very-Protean <hi rend="italic">Jungermannia </hi>will receive great additions; as well as the Orders <hi rend="italic">Gramineæ, Cyperaceæ, Musci, Lichenes, </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">Algæ. </hi>Among the many late novelties which highly delighted me—I may more particularly mention—a fine <hi rend="italic">Ranunculus</hi>, having leaves 5–7 in. broad! a glorious plant from the top of the mountn. range, bearing a profuse golden panicle of 20 or more large flowers; a species widely distinct &amp; far surpassing <hi rend="italic">R. nivicola</hi>—an enormous <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla</hi>, with flower-stalk 5 feet high, and leaves standing out all round like a coach-wheel of bayonets—a new &amp; elegant <hi rend="italic">Forstera</hi>—a minute <hi rend="italic">Astelia </hi>very diverse from <hi rend="italic">AA. pumila, alpina, </hi>and <hi rend="italic">linearis</hi>—several species of <hi rend="italic">Veronica</hi>, some highly curious—a 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> sp. of <hi rend="italic">Chrysobactron </hi>(young Hooker’s new genus)—3 species, or more, of <hi rend="italic">Arthropodium</hi>—a <hi rend="italic">Dacrydium</hi>, an elegant looking <hi rend="underline italic">tree</hi> in miniature, only 10–15 inches high and loaded with Cones—a second species of trailing moss-like growth—a <hi rend="italic">Phyloclades</hi>—several species of <hi rend="italic">Carmichælia</hi>, highly interesting; one, (elegant &amp; lissome!) a lovely drooping sp. full of leaf &amp; fragrant flower; another, growing like a <hi rend="italic">Juncus</hi>; another, a little stubborn thing, only an inch or so above the soil; another, with very long drooping filiform branches, &amp;c.,—a curious ?<hi rend="italic">Euphrasia</hi>, ditto <hi rend="italic">Ourisia</hi>—most elegant <hi rend="italic">Loranthi</hi>, 2 species, <hi rend="underline italic">now</hi> the glory of the mountain forests—2 or 3 sp. of <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi>—ditto <hi rend="italic">Pterostylis</hi>, 3 or 4 sp.—<hi rend="italic">Caladenia—Microtis—Cyrtostylis—Earina—</hi>a handsome <hi rend="italic">Myrtus</hi>—a little <hi rend="italic">Eryngo</hi>—a <hi rend="italic">Melicytus</hi>—some peculiar water-plants, one of which may prove a <hi rend="italic">Vallisneria</hi>—a climbing <hi rend="italic">Fuchsia</hi>—2 sp. of <hi rend="italic">Elæocarpi</hi>—an <hi rend="italic">Androstoma</hi>, &amp;c, &amp;c., and a lot of curious, and (to me) unique plants from the mountain summits, the affinities of which I can scarcely guess at. No doubt Hooker will do them all justice. I would they were all safe in his hands. I have—with incredible difficulty—got one box packed (since I wrote you last), and, when my Summer wanderings are over I hope to put up another which will certainly not yield the palm to any of those gone before.—</p>
         <p>I have not seen any very late serials: no. 18 of Flora Antarct.—no. 54 of Lond. Journ. Bot., part 14 of Icones Plant.—&amp; Part 3 of Sp. Filicum being my latest.—</p>
         <p>Of course I cannot enter the lists against Sir William, respecting the N.Z. Ferns, some of which he has (I dare to think,) lumped together <hi rend="italic">sans ceremonie</hi>. Black, Brown, and Blue, are, in common languages, widely different Colors, but it is easy enough to make them appear as one. <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllum Frankliniarum </hi>may be identical with <hi rend="italic">H. æruginosum</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">H. atrovirens</hi> may also be <hi rend="italic">H. crispatum</hi>; but neither <hi rend="italic">H. ærug.</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">H. crisp.</hi> were in my list of N.Z. Filices. Again, if my other <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllæ </hi>are identical with those known N.Z. ones under which Sir William has ranked them, all I can say is, that they possess characters differing from those of the species with which they are now classed. <hi rend="italic">H. villosum</hi>, I feel assured, will be altered upon reconsideration; if not, <hi rend="italic">HH. imbricatum </hi>and <hi rend="italic">revolutum</hi>; but, as you justly observe, the coming work of Hooker <hi rend="italic">fil</hi>., will clear up all.—</p>
         <p>You mention having lately discovered (among other things) a new <hi rend="italic">Fagus</hi>, at which I rejoice. I think there are several addl. species of that genus, yet to be brought to light from among the N.Z. ones. A monstrous ill-shapen Fungus, sometimes a yard broad! is found adhering under the upper branches of <hi rend="italic">F. fusca</hi> at the more N. parts of the Island. I sent one to Hooker some years ago; the Natives use it for tinder, for which purpose it is excellent.</p>
         <p>Had I the time &amp; opportunity I once had, when residing in the Bay of Islands (though then my hands were full), I could, I think, scribble you a few interesting things for your “Journal”. I had begun some papers, but, I suppose it is better to await Hooker’s forthcoming work, ere venture to say much more upon the Botany of N. Zealand. I hope, however, to send you a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> paper or two, soon.</p>
         <p>I have been a dabbler in Conchology from the beginning of my residence in this Country; but I, last year, wrote to some eminent conchologists in England, through Hooker, offering my many <hi rend="italic">species novæ</hi> for publication, &amp;c, and now I await his reply. I have, I doubt not, many novelties—although we have scarcely any beautiful or elegant species—which I should like to make known. Some, which I gave away a few years ago, have been, I find (from Dieffenbach’s work) surreptitiously published and that by those persons to whom I gave them! My shells, too, are like all my other Natural Treasures, obliged to be carefully packed up &amp; nailed down to keep them from their enemies; most of them I have not seen for years, yet I go on collecting &amp; adding to the stock.</p>
         <p>We are now, <hi rend="italic">all hands</hi>, laid up with <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>—some severely. This epidemic visits us annually about the close of the year, and is by no means a welcome Christmas guest. And now, my dear Sir, I must close,</p>
         <p>Believe me ever sincerely yours</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p> I perceive, Hooker has already rescued <hi rend="italic">Hymenoph. minim. </hi>from among <hi rend="italic">H. </hi>Tunbridgense! vol.i. Flora Antarctica.</p>
