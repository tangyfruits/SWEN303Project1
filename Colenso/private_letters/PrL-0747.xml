         <p rend="end">Woodville,<lb/>Saturday, Augt. 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.,<lb/>viii, p.m.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>I am <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, again for the Ch. duty tomorrow, and for the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>time; and being alone, with nothing to do—and feeling tired (fagged! w. doing nothing!!) I have thought I would endeavour to rouse myself a little to write <hi rend="italic">to you</hi>.—It is the last (I suppose) you will have from me written in the Bush District, as I purpose returning to Napier next week. Your kind &amp; ever-welcome letter of the 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. (St. Bartholemew’s Day—hope the Reformed Ch. in France <hi rend="italic">duly</hi> remembered it!) I received, &amp; thank you for it: and here I must say—Do not trouble yourself to write replies to <hi rend="italic">each </hi>of my scribbles as they are not worth it—and you have <hi rend="italic">much </hi>to do; &amp; <hi rend="italic">many </hi>better &amp; more valuable correspondents.—–</p>
         <p>Shortly after my last to you, I received a letter from the Bp.—informing me, that Rev. Mr. Long was <hi rend="italic">not </hi>coming to H. Bay (just as I had always supposed, &amp; had even told the Bp. so, when in Napier,)—but that he (the Bp.) had got a yg. man, lately arrived at Napier, a Mr. Clark, the son of a Clergyman in India &amp; known to the Bp., whom he should place here, &amp; for that purpose will be here, w. him, on Sunday 7<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. proxo.—and so my work (Mission) is at an end—<hi rend="italic">here</hi>: I confess I <hi rend="italic">feel </hi>it, for the Congns have gradually increased, and I shall <hi rend="italic">leave with </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">regret</hi>.—</p>
         <p>May a double portion of God’s blessing be with my successor!—our Railway carriages will only run 4 days in each week, between this &amp; Napier, &amp; only <hi rend="italic">once </hi>on each of those 4 days—viz. <hi rend="italic">My. </hi>from N. But they should use <hi rend="italic">wood </hi>for fuel, (as I pointed out to them several years ago,) especially as all along the line in the Bush is the very best of firewood (Matai, &amp;c.) in great plenty.—</p>
         <p>I fear you cannot find time to read our N. papers <hi rend="italic">re </hi>this great &amp; common <hi rend="italic">strike</hi>: there has been much of late that would interest you. I hope you and yours there at Wgn. may <hi rend="italic">not </hi>suffer in any way: yesty. C. Dolbel wrote a memo. to me to be sure to secure a small stock of Coal while there was any, so I wrote for 2 Tons: but at my place at N. I ought not to use much Coal, having plenty of good wood, but Anderson’s wife <hi rend="italic">will insist</hi> on it for <hi rend="underline italic">their use</hi>!! (We have already had <hi rend="italic">words </hi>over that!) In today’s “Herald” I notice the death in childbirth of Pirani’s eldest d. (married to a man named Gosnell at Wairoa,)—I confess, I was not so much surprised at seeing <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, as I was to hear of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>—her <hi rend="italic">mge.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Of course, you, <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, will have heard of F. Sutton’s “Petition” (a foolish thing) that has brought Dobson out, with 2 columns! letting the cat out of the bag, revealing <hi rend="italic">all</hi>!! Sutton must dislike it greatly. “Sturm’s Gulley” is to be devastated! all trees &amp; shrubs to be torn up, &amp;c.—the Contractors for Bk. water having got it for quarrying purposes.—I notice what you have said, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>my being too severe on teetotallers: perhaps I ought not to have sent <hi rend="underline italic">you </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">that paper</hi>—but, then, <hi rend="italic">you know </hi>the old &amp; common saying, “present co. always excepted:” &amp; <hi rend="italic">so </hi>here. I will not say anything more (in this note) respecting <hi rend="italic">them</hi>: but I will copy an advt. from the London “Standard” of June 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—which I <hi rend="italic">first </hi>saw during this week:—viz.—</p>
         <p>“To the Clergy.—God forbids us to kill. Is it right to eat meat when whole societies prove it unnecessary for food? Members of Royal Humane and Vegetarian Society entreat reply.” If oppory. offers I shall show <hi rend="italic">this </hi>to yr. uncle, &amp; his son Mr. Rechab. H.—This “<hi rend="italic">fad</hi>” is not a whit worse than the teetotal one—in my estimation: &amp; yet, no doubt, it has its supporters!! Howlett is out, again!—in “Pahiatua Star” (reprinted in “Bush Advoc.”)—and, <hi rend="italic">again</hi> yesty. another in “Wdv. Examr.”—I fancy, H. will get himself into trouble yet: I had a long &amp; good letter from Hill, last week, (the first for many a day!)—in which he speaks <hi rend="italic">very highly </hi>of their <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Socy. Meeting—held in his M. Room, &amp; that crowded: “Mrs. Hamilton was <hi rend="italic">present</hi>, &amp; could tell H. <hi rend="italic">all about it</hi>”! I hope to be at the next (on 8<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. proxo.)—but have <hi rend="italic">nothing </hi>to lay before it. When you have got your vol. (which, however, I hope you may already have) see, Capt. Mair’s Paper on the Moa—in which, after <hi rend="italic">much long &amp; zealous </hi>honest research, he supports <hi rend="italic">my view. </hi>I do <hi rend="italic">not like</hi> Maskell (<hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi>).</p>
         <p>I was much pleased, yesterday, on the big plain nr. wood, Dannevirke: 2 very yg. lambs had lost their dam, &amp; <hi rend="italic">they </hi>came up to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, crying &amp; follg. for some time; by-and-by I found their mother for them <hi rend="italic">down </hi>under a little hill. This missing Surveyor (Walton) has not yet been found, alive (?) nor dead: <hi rend="italic">strange stories </hi>are abroad respg. him: Time will show. Last week when here, I found in the “Wdv. Examr.”, That Mr. Saunders was to preach last Sy. on “<hi rend="underline italic">the Gorge Mystery</hi>;” and a long report of his S. is given in the “Examr.” of Wednesday last: to my astonishment, he took for his text, <hi rend="italic">Eph. </hi>v.32, “<hi rend="italic">This is a great mystery.</hi>”—–</p>
         <p>Weather very fine &amp; mild of late; Spring rapidly advancing. My old foe (Rheum.) much the same, &amp; sometimes <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>, in shoulder, obstinately fixed. But I hold on, &amp; fight my way.——I sent you a “Herald” contg. strictures on Berry: hope you got it. (6). Good night.</p>
         <p>31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. Sunday, ix p.m. Just back from Ch.—<hi rend="italic">very large &amp; very attent. Congn. this evg.</hi>—being <hi rend="italic">my </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">last</hi> (! distasteful word!) text, Phil. iv 6, 7. Mg. also, a <hi rend="italic">good </hi>Congn. for <hi rend="italic">country</hi>, about 50—text Luke x. 25: weather <hi rend="italic">very fine. </hi>I <hi rend="underline italic">feel</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">much</hi>, my dr. friend, in parting from this Ch. &amp; people—where I have now so steadily served, &amp; <hi rend="italic">seen </hi>the Congn. increasing, although my hands have been (as it were) tied, from <hi rend="italic">not knowing </hi>them &amp; having no <hi rend="italic">fixed </hi>residence among them, &amp;c—and believe <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> can </hi>enter into my feelings &amp; thoughts I write this <hi rend="italic">to you</hi>.—I took my leave of them affy. at close of Sermon—and I believe there is no small amount of <hi rend="italic">reciprocal</hi> feeling. I have, however, to return <hi rend="italic">hither</hi> for 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. proxo. (as arranged between Rev. R. Stewart &amp; myself) to give the promised Lecture—“in aid of Presbytn. Ch.”—when I <hi rend="italic">may </hi>stay a few days.</p>
         <p>There seems to have been <hi rend="italic">sad work </hi>at Gisborne (from Reports of Proceedgs. in Sup. Ct. there); <hi rend="italic">1000’ds of </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">₤</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">s. already consumed by “Trustees” in expenses—</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">Law, Commission</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">, </hi>Losses, &amp;c.—re Karaitiana’s Estates, Pakowhai, &amp; elsewhere! Ere long nothing will be left for the son! and the said case is to come on <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, in Sup. Ct. there, when auditors have gone over all!—– Brassey, is one of the latest Bankrupts of Napier: pity <hi rend="italic">he </hi>ever came <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. From Hill I learned, that Hamilton had <hi rend="italic">not </hi>written to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>—nor, as far as Hill knew, to any one in Napier.</p>
         <p>And now—Good bye! my next I suppose will be from N., whither I go on Thursday next: <hi rend="italic">glad </hi>to know your son is <hi rend="italic">improving</hi>—be patient, both Mrs. Harding &amp; yourself;—and “<hi rend="italic">Look up</hi>”.</p>
         <p>And w. <hi rend="italic">every good wish </hi>for you &amp; yours, Believe me ever, Yrs faithy.</p>
         <p>                                                             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Must add a <hi rend="italic">line</hi>—to thank <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for your keen &amp; truthful remark—“those travelling revivalists are the <hi rend="italic">worst type</hi> of religionists”—<hi rend="italic">true</hi>—–</p>
