         <p rend="end">Napier, Novr. 8/86.</p>
         <p>Mr. W.W. Yates,<lb/>Secretary<lb/>W.M.C. Horticl. Show, 1886.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>While at Norsewood (40 m. Bush) I received your note of 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. ulto. <hi rend="italic">re </hi>“exhibiting,” and should have answered at once but for a <hi rend="italic">severe </hi>attack of Lumbago, which “floored” me for several days; afterwards I thought I would do so on my return to Napier. I got back on Friday last, but was so unwell that I was obliged to go to bed &amp; send for Dr. Hitchings. I am now just down again, &amp; I lose no longer time in writing,—also, at same time thanking you for (neat) copy of your projected prizes, &amp;c &amp;c just to hand.——</p>
         <p>Unfortunately I cannot aid you in the way of exhibits, having nothing whatever that way—although I have, &amp; <hi rend="italic">do wish you every success. </hi>
         </p>
         <p>I enclose chq. for ₤1. 0. 0 towards expenses, or to be used as Commee. may direct.</p>
         <p>Please excuse scrawl, Having been greatly shaken of late.—I am</p>
         <p>Dr Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
