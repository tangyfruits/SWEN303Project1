         <p rend="end">Napier, Tuesday night<lb/>November 13<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. 1894.</p>
         <p>Dear Hans Mortensen,</p>
         <p>I was very pleased to receive your kind and welcome letter last week, it had <hi rend="italic">no date </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">inside</hi> but the post-office mark was the 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. I have been <hi rend="italic">very busy </hi>of <hi rend="italic">late</hi>, indeed I may truly say my being so busy has <hi rend="italic">only ended this day</hi>—this evening, the out-going mail to England closing. I was obliged to serve 2 Churches last Sunday; and I had been working hard in finishing my paper for our meeting held last night, and being also the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>meeting for this year I had mounted some of my new plants (from Dannevirke &amp; Woodville), also some of Mr Hill’s collecting from woods near East Cape, to show to the meeting.—</p>
         <p>I have been keeping very well—only in my returning from Woodville a fortnight ago, I caught a <hi rend="italic">severe cold</hi> and sore throat at Dannevirke, that laid me aside for several days—but I am happy to say, I am once more “<hi rend="italic">all right</hi>”—<hi rend="italic">for </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">a little longer</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I am glad, dear Hans, to find you and yours all well in health, and that you are a keeper at Home, looking after your land and garden, and enjoying the company of your own dear family growing up about you.—May our Heavenly Father ever keep, and bless you and yours; keep <hi rend="italic">fast hold</hi> of His gracious and loving promises to us, men, and be not drawn aside from the faith of your fathers, or any noisy and talkative party or people of the present time: every year seems to be bringing forth something new and strange in Religious matters, and <hi rend="italic">all under the appearance </hi>of the words and name of Jesus—but they are <hi rend="italic">not </hi>from Him:—but from “false prophets” or teachers “in sheep’s clothing,” as <hi rend="italic">He said </hi>(see Matthew, ch. VII. 13 to 23 verses.)</p>
         <p>You mention your proposed trip to the tops of Ruahine range about Christmas. Well, if you go, I hope you may enjoy your visit,—may be it will make you think you are got back to the mountains and snows of your <hi rend="italic">Fatherland</hi>.</p>
         <p>If I were young and active I should much like to go with you and Mr. Westall, but alas, that <hi rend="underline italic">cannot</hi> be, <hi rend="italic">I must be content</hi>. I thank you for your offer, to get me a few flowers or plants, but I cannot well direct you to any: you may meet with something <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, and if so, and you can <hi rend="italic">easily </hi>bring me a sprig, &amp; flower, &amp; fruit, anything to hand, do so—but <hi rend="italic">do not give yourself much trouble about it</hi>.</p>
         <p>Our year of 1894 is fast running out, and I hope to see you and Norsewood in the summer.—</p>
         <p>Remember me <hi rend="italic">most kindly </hi>to your dear Father-in-law, and to the Clemett family so <hi rend="italic">near you</hi>.</p>
         <p>And with kind regards to your good wife &amp; to yourself, Dear Hans, &amp; love to your children, I am Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
