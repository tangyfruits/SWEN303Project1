         <p rend="end">Napier, April 25<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>/98</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>—Don’t be alarmed! at my <hi rend="italic">again </hi>writing to you so soon after my last, on 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> &amp; 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. I purpose leaving tomorrow for inland,—Waipukurau until Friday or Saty., thence to Woodville (<hi rend="italic">weather permitting</hi>) for <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi>, May 1 (Harvest Thksg. Day) &amp; in a day or two returning to Dvk. for a <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> sojourn, &amp; back to Napier (D.V.)—</p>
         <p>But having got through a lot of letters &amp; notes, I thought I would write to you, to tell you a few items: Mr. James Anderson died this aftn. at 5; he had long been gradually sinking, &amp;, I hear, free from pain. Dr. Sidey, who had been <hi rend="italic">daily</hi> seeing him for some time past, (unfortunately) left N. for Gisborne last week, to preach there: the gude Sc. folks being so sadly divided respecting a Minister: Mr Paterson having lately been there <hi rend="italic">re </hi>same, but to no purpose.</p>
         <p>“<hi rend="italic">Basil</hi>”, also—the <hi rend="underline italic">old</hi> lay assistant, R.C. Meeanee Mission died on Saturday: these two of our oldest Settlers.—–</p>
         <p>The Dean is improving fast, I hope his hurt may not prove to be a serious one:—I see, in “D.T.” this evening, that he managed to marry a couple at the Cathedral this mg.—a son of Capt. Creagh to a daughter of Mrs. J. Williams— “Miss Lizzie”.</p>
         <p>I think I told you in my last of a <hi rend="italic">long </hi>letter I had received from Mrs. S. Featon of Gisborne, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>her “Album N.Z. Flora”, &amp; of my answer thereto—<hi rend="italic">equally long</hi>! (&amp; that I had sent her some Botanical plates (Lond.) for inspection—well, not having them returned, &amp; more than a month, I have just written to her about them:—but (that is prefatory!) I wished to <hi rend="italic">see </hi>a vol. of her work: Hill having got one (or more), and so lent me “<hi rend="italic">Part</hi> I”,—and to my surprise (&amp; pleasure <hi rend="italic">for your sake</hi>) I found therein a coloured drawing of <hi rend="italic">Lepidium incisum</hi>, p.22: and, in list of subscribers, “<hi rend="italic">Gen. Assembly Library</hi>”—so you may find it—and <hi rend="italic">feast</hi>!—<hi rend="italic">Kirk’s </hi>name is also in <hi rend="italic">that List</hi>, therefore he must have <hi rend="italic">known </hi>of <hi rend="italic">this plant</hi>: I notice also, that Featon gives correctly <hi rend="italic">my Carmichaelias</hi>—but there are errors in the work, and I do not like the <hi rend="italic">high </hi>colours, &amp;c.—and then the big heavy vol. is <hi rend="italic">shamefully </hi>bound—in leather, gilded, with <hi rend="italic">thick </hi>covers &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">nothing</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> to hold them</hi>! Hill’s book has covers broken off.</p>
         <p>I deem it <hi rend="italic">rather </hi>strange, that I have not yet heard from Govt. Ptg. Off., <hi rend="italic">re </hi>letter “A.”—neither from Seddon: hope there are <hi rend="italic">no more </hi>hindrances.</p>
         <p>Prebble, Sen., is still in the hospital; operation <hi rend="italic">not </hi>successful: and Rev. Mr. Cornford is <hi rend="italic">also there</hi>—&amp; “<hi rend="italic">very near death</hi>”. So Ansell Tiffen told me here this evening—he came up to tell me of Mr Anderson’s death, he having <hi rend="underline italic">frequently</hi> visited him of late.</p>
         <p>Goodbye—kindest regards:</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely,                                 W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>As <hi rend="italic">you know </hi>all <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Mao. Lexn. in past,—If <hi rend="italic">none have been struck off for Govt</hi>.—could you not suggest some fair &amp; feasible plan for me to act on, w. S.?</p>
