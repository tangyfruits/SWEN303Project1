         <p rend="end">Sunday night,<lb/>Jany. 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>./ 97.</p>
         <p>My dear Dr. de Lisle</p>
         <p>I was not a little upset yesterday in seeing in the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> of your severe accident:—it being under the heading of “Hastings” news. I did <hi rend="italic">not </hi>see it <hi rend="italic">early</hi>, so waited for the <hi rend="italic">Evg</hi>. paper, supposing that <hi rend="italic">there</hi> I should find the full account, but was disappointed,—and then began to hope that your own injuries were magnified: and further intended, that in my going to Cathedral <hi rend="italic">this mg.</hi> I would call and learn: but I did not go out, (I have not been down for <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">last</hi> week,)—and I shall send this by my man in the morning, that he may <hi rend="italic">enquire</hi>, and bring me back a reply.—I sincerely hope that <hi rend="italic">you have not </hi>any <hi rend="italic">broken </hi>bones. <hi rend="italic">One item</hi>—even in that sad local—that served to cheer me, was, that Mrs. de Lisle &amp; baby had received <hi rend="underline italic">no</hi> injury; I hope this is true—though I fear <hi rend="italic">somewhat</hi>.——</p>
         <p>I duly received your kind note, and will be <hi rend="italic">sure </hi>to call on you: some early morning when I go to town.—</p>
         <p>With kind regards and best wishes, and <hi rend="italic">good hopes</hi>.</p>
         <p>         Believe me,</p>
         <p>                         Yours faithy.</p>
         <p>                                         W. Colenso.</p>
