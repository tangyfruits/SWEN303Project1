         <p>(No. 7)                      WAITANGI, June 20th., 1854.</p>
         <p>Mrs. E. Colenso,</p>
         <p>Otahuhu, near Auckland.</p>
         <p>My dear Elizabeth,</p>
         <p>I wrote you a long letter on the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of March last, which I hope has long ago reached you. I have <hi rend="italic">no </hi>letters <hi rend="italic">from </hi>you to acknowledge; but as I promised in my last to send you some money on little <hi rend="italic">Wi’s</hi> account, and as I have very lately obtained through Mr. Alexander’s kindness (and without immediately paying him) a Bill on his Auckland agent for £20, and a vessel being about to sail immediately for Wellington, I hasten to send it. You will perceive that it is drawn in <hi rend="italic">duplicate</hi>, this I got done fearing any casualty; and I intend to send you the duplicate by some more direct opportunity, as I hear (from Mr. Alexander) of a vessel being daily expected from Auckland. I had the Bill drawn in your brother’s favour, as by so doing it cannot be of any service until he endorses it; so that if stolen &amp; presented it would not be honoured.</p>
         <p>At the date of my last, I think, we were suffering from a heavy waipuke, and we are now just rallying from another and a heavier one; or, rather, it would have been heavier had not Ngaruroro forced a mouth long before the flood was at its height, but not until the Boys’ House was under water. Such a mouth, wider than the entrance at Ahuriri, and directly opposite to Te Ikapakakahawai—or, where that spot was, for all that land is gone, with the pathways, the grassy knolls, &amp; your and the children’s Toetoe bush—all is washed away!! There are now but 3 toetoe bushes remaining between the head of the swamp water and Ngaruroro; and the river has made a new creek (where the children’s toetoe bush was) directly this way, which is now 40 feet long by measurement; so that, in a little while, it will be running in its <hi rend="italic">old</hi> channel again. This flood (i.e. the rain) began on the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. of May, and lasted a fortnight!! It is now fine but cold, with much snow on the hills. The little cutter “Kawai” was out in all that severe weather, 20 days from Wellington, 6 of which they had no fire, through midwinter!! escaped by miracle.</p>
         <p>Heretaunga has been in <hi rend="italic">great</hi> commotion since my last; such as you never witnessed. I think I must have told you of the death of the principal chief Ngatiupokoiri, Hori te Kaharoa at Omahu. Well, all hands went there to tangi; and Hori Niania &amp; Arapera te Ngira were detected together! (you know they had long been suspected). This made a greet stir which was increased by Arapera’s confessing that such had always been the case between them, and that Reko, the chief Te Moananui’s wife, was in a similar position! Te Moananui &amp; others endeavoured in vain to get Reko to confess:—at last she confessed to Hapuku, implicating also the great lady Te Hei, as being alike with them!—and all with Hori! Now the fire raged—all the principal chiefs being more or less concerned (and the Popish priest, Jesuit-like, at the back encouraging Puhara) a grand Committee was held at Te Aute, and again at Te Waipukurau; and a £1000 for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> offence was demanded, but for the <hi rend="italic">third</hi>, if true, (Te Hei and Hori both denying it) Hori should lose all his lands and be banished forever! Taare Hauaitu set on Wi Tipuna, and Wi Tipuna, Hori, to give nothing. On this the chiefs returned raging: went again &amp; again to Mr. Domett, the R.M. at Ahuriri, and at last it was arranged to be fully heard at Ahuriri. It was also privately determined that if no damages were given, Hori should be set on and killed! Hapuku called on me and said that he the principal promoter would <hi rend="italic">not </hi>attend the meeting. Things wore a most ugly appearance. Mr. Domett wrote to all the Magistrates and all the respectable settlers to attend; (I well remembering the sad affair at Waitangi, Bay of Islands, nearly 20 years ago, gave Mr. Domett all the information I could to put him on his guard) and the Magistrates wrote to me, requesting my attendance to assist them &amp;c. Well, Thursday, June 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. was to be the day of hearing and on Wednesday, 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. May, all Heretaunga went to Ahuriri—all, lords and commons, “rag, tag &amp; bobtail” such a turn-out! Throughout May the weather had been delightfully fine, and I knew that when rain should come it would be sufficient. Sure enough, on the very 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. it began, gradually. I suppose 200 horses crossed the Waitangi Creek on that day. Early on June 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. I walked to Ahuriri, and got there pretty dry. The whole of that day, till 6 or 7 p.m. we were hard at work; then we <hi rend="italic">all</hi> dined together, that is as many as could stow, 25 or so about half being chiefs; all very orderly even over their wine. About 10 p.m. we 1eft, i.e. Mr. Curling, a Magistrate from inland, &amp; myself, in rain &amp; wind &amp; darkness—to walk right over the hill or island to Mr. Domett’s house where we 2 slept. We got there partly crawling on our hands and knees! the worst was the descending the zig-zag narrow track down the face of the high &amp; steep cliff! What a wretched time those natives must have had! Next day we recommenced work and after another hard day &amp; <hi rend="italic">night</hi>, too, we decided as follows: Damages in Arapera’s case £100: in Reko’s £40: in Te Hei’s nothing (for the time) save a most severe lecture from the Bench to Reko, which I had to translate, and <hi rend="italic">did give</hi> (&amp; no mistake) also, a word of warning to Hori. The payment was immediately made: i.e. ₤90 in gold and a horse £50 = ₤140, which was paid over to Karaitiana (who personated Te Moananui who we had advised to stay away) and to Urupene, Ahapera’s husband. Late at night Mr. Curling and myself returned as before, in the howling, drenching storm to Mr. Domett’s. The next day the weather was worse! I sat on thorns (in the midst of great kindness) till 3 p.m., when, greatly against their wishes, I started on foot on my return to Waitangi in dreadful weather, It was dark before I got half-ways, and before I came to the Church I found the flood up on the bank! I waded to the river’s edge and spent nearly an hour in endeavouring to make old Matiaha hear, but in vain. At last I returned, headed the flood water, &amp; came on over the sea beach, intending to swim across with the key of the study in my mouth; but I found a white man sheltering in Pao Torotoro’s deserted hut, who agreed to put me across in a little dinghey he had there, which he partly did, in the pitchy darkness, and I, leaping out, waded to the study; soon after the whole garden was flooded.</p>
         <p>There is little good now among this people. There has been <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Service in the big Church here since Mr. S. Williams returned in April! From Noah I learn that one of Mr. S. Williams’ teachers at Otaki had been stealing from him and <hi rend="italic">forging</hi>! so that Mr. Williams put him into prison at Wellington; and, on his late return from this place, one of his own baggage bearers stole the “Sacrament money” collected here, on their way back to Otaki; this has made a great talk.. These things speak volumes to those who have ears to hear.</p>
         <p>The Magistrate wrote a severe letter to Matiu Meke for his conduct towards me; upon which Matiu attempted to justify it by saying—such was the nature of my letter! at the same time refusing to show it. By-and-bye this very letter was dropped by him in the road, and the chief Nopara and others got hold of it, and sent it to the Magistrate for him to see, saying— “ki a matou nei, kaore tahi ne hue a roto” (i.e. to us who have seen it, there is nothing whatever in it (to find fault with). As a matter of course, it was now seen by all—native and white, and I too wished to see it (having quite forgotten it); and a return letter has also been written by the Magistrate to Te Waipukurau, saying (I quote the concluding sentence, as I have subsequently seen it and copied it)</p>
         <p>“kahore he hoe o taua tuhi a Neho, ki taku titiro, ki ta nga tangata katoa hoki, ahakoa pakeha, ahakoa Maorj” (i.e. There is nothing wrong in that writing by Colenso, in my estimation, also in that of all other men, whether whites or natives). Matiu had the impudence to attend the big enquiry at Ahuriri. He, however, with Micah, his friend, (and Wi Tipuna’s brother) had to leave the room. Noah, on the contrary, was spoken well of.</p>
         <p>I fear (I may rather say, I know) that Mr. S. Williams has been encouraging Matiu Meke, not, I would still believe, maliciously, but through his receiving and believing <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Matiu says, as well as all that Wi Tipuna and that party say. But it will all come out one day. Of Hamuera and Ripeka I know nothing. Perhaps I should tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that the Bench of Magistrates gave me their public thanks at Ahuriri, in which all the settlers present joined &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I have suffered a good deal lately from ear and toothache, and rheumatism, owing to my getting so very wet and cold, but am better now. A fortnight ago Roka accidentally burnt my bag of clothes which she had to wash, which I could badly spare; some too, I had but lately mended. I fear one or two of my best and new shirts were in the lot—their first washing.</p>
         <p>The goods which I sent to Wellington were sacrificed! I almost wished they had been burnt in the fire. The great floor-cloth cost £9, sold for £3. Black dress coats cost £5 each, sold for £1.10.0. Books sold for 1/- per vol. which cost 10/-. The <hi rend="italic">sable</hi> Victorine sold for a guinea less than it cost in London. But enough of this.</p>
         <p>I think continually upon you <hi rend="italic">all—</hi>all 4. The 3 dear children are ever present. I hope soon to hear from you, &amp; Fanny and Latty. I often dream of you all. My best love to <hi rend="italic">them all</hi> in the most loving way. I hope soon to write to them; I should Long ago have done so, but have tied my hands. Tell Latty I have a little <hi rend="italic">bat</hi> here, living with me in the study and at liberty. All day he hangs by his hind legs, but is pretty brisk every night, flying &amp; crawling about. I hope you either see (at times) or keep a motherly look-out after Wi. Poor little dear! who now takes care of him? in the wet, and mud, and cold. I hope God’s holy angels will, if no human being cares for the dear child.</p>
         <p>Our town’s name is Port Napier. I must conclude and hasten this off. The leaves of the trees which, when you left were scarcely budding forth, are now fallen and falling, making the garden and me melancholy. But I have often a ray shed down, especially on Sundays, when reading God’s Holy Word. May God bless you, Elizabeth, and <hi rend="italic">counsel</hi> you, and soften your heart to receive <hi rend="italic">His </hi>counsel. This is my constant prayer,</p>
         <p>                     From yours truly,</p>
         <p>                             William.</p>
