         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I wish to write you a few lines by this Mail, to tell you how deeply I sympathize w. you—at Otago—at your being so greatly disappointed (&amp; injured) by the non-appearance of Sir G. Grey among you. It has grieved me very much. I have seen an account of your opening, and am glad to find the “Ramsay”, with all the foreign exhibits, has arrived.</p>
         <p>I am hard at work for you, &amp; <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> to send you my Mss. by next Steamer.</p>
         <p>I have received a Copy of Dr. Hooker’s “Hand Book”—part i. I am glad to find <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have sent so many new &amp; choice things from your Southern Lands.—I always told Hooker there was a great plenty yet to come from N.Z. I am glad to find he has at last done justice to some of my <hi rend="italic">old</hi> sp.—particularly to the <hi rend="italic">Phormium </hi>&amp;<hi rend="italic"> Coriaria</hi>:—though I think my own naming for the <hi rend="italic">Phormium</hi> should have stood. I find you also speak of a <hi rend="italic">3</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">rd</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. </hi>sp. I hope you have received a Copy: if not, &amp; you wish it,—I will gladly send you mine by Post.—I have not had time to go much into it. I wish I could have had it 4 or 6 months back. Mr. Francis has kindly sent me a copy of his “Chatham Islands’ plants” by Mueller—I am very glad to see it; but I do not agree in much that M. has done. Hooker, too, has <hi rend="italic">lumped</hi> both sp., &amp; even old genera, together in his new work.—</p>
         <p>As before, wishing you <hi rend="italic">every success</hi>—I am</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. Kind regards to your good colleague, Mr. Wm. Mason.</p>
         <p>You tell me—<hi rend="italic">Mr. Taylor</hi> wrote the essay on Zoology: I hope he will have satisfied you. If I had had my choice, it would have been the one I should have chosen.</p>
         <p>I am glad to find Seemann is publishing the Feejee Islands Flora: our Eng. Mail has not yet turned up. W.C.</p>
