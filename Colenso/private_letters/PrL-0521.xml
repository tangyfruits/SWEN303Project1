         <p rend="end">Napier, Octr. 31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>., 1882</p>
         <p>Dear Dr. Buller,</p>
         <p>A short time ago I received a copy of your “Address in the Nat. Land Court, as Counsel for Ngatiapa,” (very well got up in a neat pamphlet,) and as <hi rend="italic">I suppose</hi> it was a kind remembrance from you—I now beg to thank you for it. I had been thinking much of you of late,—though dreadfully busy, in hopes of getting away to the forests a fortnight back, (now that our Ordinary Institute meetings are over for this year,) but, just as I was about to start, attacked with Lumbago! I hope, however, to leave on the 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. proxo. What caused me to think more than usual of you, was, (1.) I had recd. from the mountainous interior a very elegant specimen of a small dark Petrel, alive, that was new to me, and I could not reconcile it with any of your <hi rend="italic">very brief</hi> descriptions in your late “Manual”: I kept it 2 days under a wire Dish-Cover, when I killed it w. chloroform, and sent it to Col. Musm. to Dr. Hector, as I was sending him by that Mail our <hi rend="italic">read papers</hi>,—and was not sure of your being then at Wellington. Its habits were <hi rend="italic">nocturnal</hi>: as still as a mouse in the day, but restless at night; it almost destroyed its pretty little beak by incessantly probing the wires of its prison, though I had covered it well up w. black cloth.—(2.) In looking into your “Manual” (a borrowed copy), I found you had wholly omitted my pretty little <hi rend="italic">Coot</hi>: also, all reference to my early living specimen of the <hi rend="italic">small Bittern</hi>, &amp;c., &amp;c.—(3.) And now, in looking into a <hi rend="italic">late </hi>no. of “Nature” (serial), I find, that a couple of living specimens of our little green Parrokeet have been recently placed in the Zool. Gardens, under the new (?) gen. name of <hi rend="italic">Cyanoramphus</hi>.—–</p>
         <p>             I hope you are well, and w. kind regards, &amp; thanks,</p>
         <p>             Believe me,</p>
         <p>                                     Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
