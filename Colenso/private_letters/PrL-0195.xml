         <p>His Honor D. Maclean, Esq.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I find the “Rangatira” is to leave this port for Napier on Monday next, and I hasten to give you some information which I have lately (by “Queen”) received from Napier. </p>
         <p>I have had 2 letters of warning, written by a <hi rend="italic">friendly</hi> pair of Natives living between Havelock and Waipawa, (whose names and village I must not divulge,)—from which I quote verbatim:—(the first is written to the boy, Willie,)—</p>
         <p>. . . “ka nui te pouri o toku ngakau ki a korua ko tou papa, nui noa atu te aroha, na, he korero tenei, naku ki a korua, he whakaaro roa, kia tupato ki nga mahi o te ao, ara a te hauhau, ka tata tonu nga mahi a te arero kai taewa o te maori te kino ki te ao koia ahau ka tuhi atu ai kia rongo korua, kia noho tupato kei wareware te ngakau ki te mahara.” (the second, to me, is much the same, he adds,)—“E hoa, e Neho, ko tena korero i tuhia atu na, he mea tuhi tahae na mana, kia rongo korua, E hoa, ko ta mana nei mahara, me i kona (Napier) ano koe, kua tae atu mana ki kona, &amp;c.—kei korerotia e korua taua kino ti te tangata, &amp;c. &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>These letters were written on the 24th August, and fortunately forwarded on by Bourke to me.—</p>
         <p>Curiously enough, a Native Chief (at present here from the North,) shewed me the other day—on finding I had known his relatives and friends at the Bay of Islands—a long and <hi rend="italic">good</hi> letter he had written to the Govt. here, warning them not to be careless, and not to trust too much to their <hi rend="italic">best</hi> Maori friends. I have not told any one here of my letters from Napier, save Ormond,—and I only hope, I may not only be in time, but that you (we) may not have any disturbance from that quarter.—</p>
         <p>I hope you are quite well. Ormond will give you all pol. news.</p>
         <p>     Believe me,</p>
         <p>       Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>             Wm. Colenso.</p>
