         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Ahuriri,<lb/>May 5, 1857.</p>
         <p>To His Honor,<lb/>  The Superintendent<lb/>  of Wellington.</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>I have the honor to address you on the subject of the route through the “Forty mile Bush” (the forest bounded by the Ruamahanga and Manawatu Rivers), in compliance with your Honor’s request, made to me at Napier on the 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. ult.</p>
         <p>I confess, Sir, that I feel not a little diffident in writing what I know about it; seeing that the Chief Surveyor has already not only both gone over the present Maori track and chained it, but has also drawn up a professional Report of the same, which he has further illustrated by </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">[second page missing]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Geographical</hi>:—</p>
         <p>Commencing then at Te Kotukutuku, on the Ruamahanga river, the course immediately from that stream is up a long hill, which ascent, at first, is very precipitous and also wet (from water oozing from its cliffy side), so that it is a difficult matter for a Native carrying a load to get up; having gained the summit, the descent is much more gradual, but over broken ground for several miles, until you near the Mangatainoka River; occasionally intersected by several small streams and watercourses, and many deep muddy patches, (caused by the loose springy nature of the soil, the immense quantity of decaying vegetable matter, and the constant humidity of the range). From the River Mangatainoka to Te Hawera<note xml:id="ftn2-43" place="foot" n="43"> Bagnall &amp; Petersen place Te Hawera: “Modern Hamua, on the Woodville-Masterton highway, north of Eketahuna. The name ‘Hawera’ is still preserved in the district.”</note> (a little open space of fern land, the only one in the whole forest, and where was formerly a village,) distant about four miles, the course is tolerably level; which is also the case, with but little interruption, until you reach a very swampy spot, about six miles further on, and where you have to ascend some way on a steep hill’s side, named, Pahiatua. Thence the country is again tolerably level (for a N.Z. forest), with occasional watercourses, deep swampy spots, and dark lagoon-like holes, until you again cross the River Mangatainoka. Whence, to the River Manawatu, a distance of about four miles, the ground is very much more broken and difficult, with several steep terraces and swampy hollows.</p>
         <p>The surface soil is (as might be expected) universally composed of decaying vegetable matter, intermixed, in the low levels, with alluvial deposits, and which is of unequal depths, varying from 3–4 inches to a foot and upwards.—The sub soil appears to be in a few places of loam, but generally of clay with small broken pebbles intermixed. I have never noticed any stone on the whole route, save the pebbles and shingle in the beds of some of the streams.—And, from the indurated clay slightly schistose in the cliffs of the Ruamahanga appearing again in a ford of the Mangatainoka River near Te Hawera, and again in the cliffy sides of the River Manawatu, I have little doubt but that the same stratum underlies the whole forest at no great depth.—</p>
         <p>I have already mentioned the numerous small streams and watercourses which intersect the track <hi rend="italic">in </hi>the forest; besides which there are two principal ones, the Rivers Makakahi and Mangatainoka; the latter being, at one of its fords, the widest mountain stream between Napier and Wellington. (This River the Chief Surveyor states in his Report to be 100 yards wide.) These two Rivers have to be crossed five times during the route; and at no present fording-place do they possess high banks, except at two of the fords, where they have a tolerably high bank on one side only; but which, from the inclination of the stream and the nature of the soil, falls away with every fresh. I believe, also, that, on close examination, those high banks (3–4 feet) on the one side will be found to be of a saucer-like formation, viz.—higher on the immediate edge of the stream.—</p>
         <p>—This saucer-like form is easily accounted for: in time of floods, the bushes on the immediate bank (always very dense until torn away) collect a vast quantity of vegetable matter, which, while forced inwards by the strength of the waters, cannot proceed far into the forest. On the slow subsiding of the muddy water, the mud and smaller light forest residuum (i.e. leaves and twigs) are there detained, and, in the course of a few years, a very considerable deposit is there accumulated. (This has actually been the case—though on a much smaller scale—here, at Waitangi, where I reside—the soil near the face of the lower side of the field in front of my house has been raised more than a foot since the erection of the close (paled) fence in 1845, the lower bar of which was originally about ten inches from the ground, and is now, in some places, from 3 to six feet below it, owing to the deposit of fine mud there stopped by the fence in the time of inundations; this has given that part of the field a similar saucer-like form.) And this, where the high and raised bank holds, is the cause of those disagreeable muddy back-water spots, so commonly to be met with a little beyong the higher banks of those and similar Rivers.—</p>
         <p>In addition to the above, the two wide Rivers, Ruamahanga and Manawatu, (navigable, at all times for canoes, or even boats,) bound the “Bush” on its N. and S. sides, and must also be crossed.—</p>
         <p>The currents in all the Bush streams are slow, owing, chiefly, to their very slight fall.—</p>
         <p>In several places in the forest around Te Hawera, particularly in the low lands on its N. side, are many dark lagoons, or deep putrid pools, of irregular shape and size; some of which are destitute of vegetation on their banks, while others possess the usual dense swamp jungle.—</p>
         <p>Those deep pools and holes contain the waters left by the floods when the Rivers overflow their banks, a case of very common occurrence especially in the winter and the spring. It is also very probable that their bottoms are lower than the beds of the adjacent Rivers.— </p>
         <p>In the time of great floods the forest is impassable, the waters rising and spreading over the whole low country for several miles, which waters very slowly drain off.—</p>
         <p>I have even known the open ground at Te Hawera to be three feet under water, almost choking the Fern and Grass with the thick muddy deposit it left, and which I have had to work my way through.</p>
         <p>Such floods are a great cause of the unusually open state of the forest in the low levels—i.e. with regard to its possessing but little underwood; hence the “good travelling” which the fortunate traveller there meets with in <hi rend="italic">dry </hi>seasons.—</p>
         <p>It is surprising how very rapidly those mountain streams increase, and that, too, from other cause than rain. They often do so after a warm wind has blown strongly for a day or two; such not only melts the snows on the summits in the early spring, but also, (I feel assured,) farther on in the summer, conveys masses of vapour thither from the sea, which is there condensed and quickly precipitated on the lower lands—a fact, I believe, also witnessed by Humboldt on the higher table lands of the Cordillera.—</p>
         <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Botanical</hi>:—</p>
         <p>Under this head I am fortunate in being able to refer your Honor to the Flora N.Z. lately published for corroborative testimony (if needed); the name of Te Hawera forests being often mentioned in its pages as the recorded habitat of many plants; particularly of those species which require either a low watery situation, or constant humidity to develop them.—</p>
         <p>Such as, of terrestrial <hi rend="italic">Ferns</hi> (only found in very low wet woods), <hi rend="italic">Lomaria fluviatalis, L. nigra, L. procera, L.pumila, Hymenophyllum formosum </hi>(its only known N.Z. habitat); of the genus <hi rend="italic">Hydrocotyle</hi>, several species; several genera of large terrestrial <hi rend="italic">Musci</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi>;<hi rend="italic"> </hi>and of fresh-water <hi rend="italic">Algæ</hi>; together with a very large majority of the Natural Order <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ</hi>; many specimens of which have been declared by Dr. Hooker to be even finer than those obtained by him in the ever-dripping forests of Fuegia and Cape Horn.—</p>
         <p>In travelling through those low levels around Te Hawera (especially on its N. side), I have often noticed the self-recorded high-water mark of the preceding winter’s inundations remaining distinctly traced on the pendant Mosses which draperied the trunks of the larger trees;—and which sometimnes had risen to the height of three and four feet, or even more.—</p>
         <p>Of the larger trees, which are numerous on the lower grounds, <hi rend="italic">Nesodaphne</hi> (Tawa), <hi rend="italic">Podocarpus </hi>(Kahikatea, or “Swamp Pine”), and <hi rend="italic">Plagianthus, </hi>are by far the most common. The Tawa has been spoken of as being “an indication of good soil”; of this, however, I am not quite so sure, as I am of both it and its neighbours indicating a wet one.—</p>
         <p>On the S. side of Te Hawera (especially between the Rivers Makakahi and Mangatainoka), there are some very fine specimens of <hi rend="italic">Podocarpus </hi>(Totara), <hi rend="italic">Dacrydium </hi>(Rimu), and <hi rend="italic">Metrosideros </hi>(Rata), to be met with; but they are generally isolated.—</p>
         <p>Those forests abound in <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi>, many of which are of monstrous size and are rapidly developed after rains or floods; to this circumstance may in great measure be attributed the unhealthiness of those parts: [<hi rend="italic">Vide</hi>, Statistics.] as, unlike other plants, <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi>, instead of purifying the air by drawing-off its carbonic acid and restoring oxygen, vitiate it, by exhaling carbonic acid and absorbing oxygen.</p>
         <p>I have little doubt but that the present track, in a great degree, owes its firmness to the interlacing roots of the living trees through which it winds: now only let the trees be felled on both sides of the same, and the roots consequently decay (which, from their chiefly belonging to the most quickly perishable of all our N.Z. woods, would very soon be the case,) and the path on the lower grounds would soon become a muddy drain instead of a travellable track.—</p>
         <p>I have often noticed the very peculiar effect caused by the falling of some tree in low dense forests, and by the consequent admission of a little more light and air; namely, that vegetation invariably perishes all around. Now this, I apprehend, will be sure to follow upon the opening of an avenue-like road in such a forest as this, which may be almost deemed primæval; and which, for some considerable time, will both obstruct and endanger the road from falling and fallen timber; the sooner, perhaps, from the fact of its trees being only lateral rooted.—</p>
         <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Statistical</hi>:—</p>
         <p>The Ngatitutaiaroa tribe of Natives, who, for several years (i.e. from 1846,) dwelt at Te Hawera, lived, before that time, at a village called Ihuraua—a place about 14 miles distant in a N.E. direction through the forests from Te Hawera, but situate on very much higher ground.—</p>
         <p>This truly isolated little party (many of whom had never before seen a white man,) proposed to me, on our second meeting, in 1846, to remove their dwelling to Te Hawera, if I would regularly visit them (in common with the other Native villages of the District), as, by their so doing, they would save me several additional miles of heavy forest travelling up and down on the same line. So that, instead of returning to Hawke’s Bay from the village near the head of the Wairarapa calley (Te Kaikokirikiri) via Whareama and the Coast, as hitherto, I should henceforth travel towards Te Hawera and Ngaawapurua over pretty nearly the present track; which, at first, was particularly heavy owing to the (then) trackless state of the forest, as well as the open Fern Lands at the head of the Wairarapa valley; a journey which (from Te Hawera to Te Kaikokirikiri) invariably took, at first, in fine weather and no floods, three long and toilsome days.</p>
         <p>On their removal to Te Hawera, in 1846, I noted down the names and number of the tribe; which amounted to,<lb/>  men 25: wom. 20: childn. 6 = 51.<lb/>The whole party settled quietly down; built their huts, and also a little rustic chapel; cultivated different spots of the forests around; and, in the course of two or three years, had all professed the Christian Faith. They rarely visited, and when they did only went to the nearest villages—Mataikona (E. Coast), Te Kaikokirikiri (Wairarapa), and Ngaawapurua (Manawatu).</p>
         <p>This little simple and wholly isolated party had a large share of my attention; as, at first, I had sanguine hopes, of their becoming an increasingly pleasing community.—</p>
         <p>From several of the Native Xn. teachers of this District (whom I often sent to visit them), they had also much attention: Te Hawera village was altogether No. 1, in our estimation.—</p>
         <p>At that early time (1846) I knew nothing of the truly deadly nature of the site they had chosen. The Lands thereabouts were their own, and I could not but suppose that they were the best judges in such matters.—</p>
         <p>Finding, however, that several deaths had invariably occurred between every interval of my visiting: that their disorders were constantly of one, or two, types,—Fever, both intermittent and Rheumatic, and Pulmonary Consumption: that the living were greatly altered in appearance, although largely possessed of good food, both animal and vegetable: and, that the floors of their huts were always more or less damp; and, also, having, by this time, both noticed and experienced what I have already written, I began to suspect the true cause of their ailments, and earnestly urged their speedy removal to some better (higher and more open) Site; this, however, I could not now effect. They would not (or, rather, could not,) believe their daily lessening numbers was caused by the unhealthiness of the spot; but (wholly in accordance with N.Z. ideas) by the malediction and enchantments of their old enemies because they had received the Xn. Faith: which Faith, however, they would never abandon, and consequently (reasoning as New Zealanders) the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>little Chapel of their Tribe, and their dead relations who lay buried around it.—The end is soon told: up to May, 1851, the number of deaths of this small party (including their principal man then lately deceased), amounted to<lb/>
            <hi rend="italic"> men</hi>, 14: <hi rend="italic">wom. </hi>14: <hi rend="italic">childn.</hi> 4 = 32<lb/>and the sorrowing remnant were then, at length, yielding to my advice, (or, more properly speaking, commands,) and were about to depart for the open country in the lower Manawatu. In March, 1852, (when I last went that way,) one of the tribe had come from their new place of abode to meet me at Te Hawera; who informed me, that, before that they had left the place, another male had died, making a gross total of 33 (thirty three) out of 51 (fifty one) in the space of 5 (five years)! several of whom were young, both of males and females.</p>
         <p>The number of births during the same period was only six, of which, four had also subsequently died.—</p>
         <p>The resting-place of a number of these dead, is strikingly indicated in the Chief Surveyor’s Sketch Survey, as “<hi rend="italic">Graves</hi>”—in the little Fern oasis of Te Hawera.—</p>
         <p>The rude little chapel of this people, being the last house built, had been erected on much higher grounds, at some little distance from their huts (and close to the present “graves”). There, although at least three feet higher, the ground had also been flooded.—</p>
         <p>In time of floods the inhabitants used to escape to a high terrace on the edges of the forest a little beyond their chapel; where, indeed, they were safe, but quite cut off from all human aid.—</p>
         <p>With hopes of alleviating their sad situation some of the party made a cultivation and erected houses on the river’s bank at Pahiatua; from this, however, they were also driven by the floods, when they made another attempt upon a steep hill not far off.</p>
         <p>At this last mentioned place my (then) principal N. Teacher from Ahuriri found a few of them with their chief, on a visit he made to Te Hawera, when, and only with great difficulty, he got so far as this place, but could not go any further; and, although they had all previously known the day of his coming, and he also, on his arrival, induced a young man to go from Pahiatua as a messenger to them, yet those at Te Hawera could not come to him, neither did the messenger come back, owing to the great depth and extent of the inundation in the forest: after waiting several days the N. Teacher returned to Ahuriri.—</p>
         <p>All Natives whom I, at different times, sent to visit Te Hawera, always travelled thither with some fear as to their being shut in by floods. I have known some of the Natives of the place, who had been out visiting, to make ineffectual attempts to return to their home, and to come back to their entertainers and there uneasily remain more than a month through the untravellable state of the low forest.</p>
         <p>The Natives of Te Hawera could never succeed in raising Pumpkins and Melons, nor even Maize. On one occasion I did however obtain a small unripe Pumpkin from the old Chief, which had been grown there, and which he had saved for me.—</p>
         <p>I learned, from the Natives, that in none of the many streams of this forest are any of those justly-prized edible fishes, (called by them, Inanga, Kokopu, and Paneroro,) so common in the other waters, to be found. Although such abound both in the Manawatu and Ruamahanga rivers.</p>
         <p>In this writing for your Honor’s information, I have, on the one hand, nothing hypothetical to advance, nor, on the other, any favorite scheme of my own, to seek to influence your Honor in its favor. I had simply a few facts to relate, and which I trust, I have unassumingly done. As a Landowner (to some little extent) here at Napier, I can only wish to see a <hi rend="italic">good </hi>Road of Communication between it and Wellington quickly opened up; but I have no hesitation in stating (as my opinion), that such cannot be by the <hi rend="italic">present </hi>route through the “Forty mile Bush.” At the same time I am far from denying the possibility of such being yet found between Wairarapa and Manawatu;—perhaps, by keeping upon a higher level, a mile or two W. of, and parallel with the present track, and so reaching the Manawatu river a little lower down; but, from the dense nature of those almost impenetrable forests, as well as their extent, such a road must ever prove to be a serious undertaking.—</p>
         <p>I have the honor to be, Sir,</p>
         <p>Your very obedient servant,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
