         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Octr. 23/48.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have to acknowledge no less than 5 Letters &amp; Invoices from you, dated respy.—July 5 &amp; Octr 14/47, and Jany 21, Jan 31 &amp; Feby 19/48—as well as the goods sent pr. Victoria &amp; Elora which almost came to hand together—and all safely.—I cannot tell you how very much I am indebted to you; for being so kindly mindful of me &amp; my wishes; not forgettg <hi rend="italic">party.</hi> to mention the several little parcels from highly valued friends wh. from time to time I have been gratified with the receipt of thro yr. kind agency. I should have written to you before but I lacked both time &amp; oppory: this Letter &amp; enclosures I now take myself to Wellington, in my usual spring jy. down the Coast. The goods pr. Elora arrived here about 3 weeks ago; &amp; the Case pr. Victoria (wh. had slumbered at Wellington) a short time before them.—</p>
         <p>First howr. let me reply to yr. Letters, <hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi>,—The 2 Cases wh. you shipped for me from CMS.—contg. Stationery &amp; slates—came duly to hand. The orig. Bill of charges for loss of anchor &amp;c of Madras, I cannot (I regret to say) send you, but perhaps Archd. W. can—I paid him my share, wh. he had paid (with his own) at Well. for me; and I also pd. my agents there (Messrs B. &amp; H.) anor. demand upon some other article wh. came thro them by the same ship, so that in neither case did I obtain the orig. Bill.—I believe I have recd. the Cask pr. L. Campbell wh. was supposed to have been lost! &amp; in a sad condition: that is, a cask of sundries (without letter) evidently from my old friend Mr. B. has reached me, &amp; wh. has been for a long while knocking about upon the N.Z. shores; but whether it is <hi rend="italic">that cask</hi> or not I cannot say—the contents, old clothes, old books, &amp; remnants of calico &amp;c, value 40/-. It came to me from Mr. Hamlin, to him from the Archdn. but I cannot satisfactorily trace it further. From Mr. Oct. Brown I have very lately recd. a kind Xn. Line., in wh. he advises me of his having sent an order to his London agents to pay you the money due—&amp; which I suppose you have recd. ere this—&amp; the goods are now on their way hither.—In yr. long &amp; kind line. of 29 Jany. you mention “having put 2 or 3 Scripture Prints into one of the cases” no such things however have been found. The little order generally pleased us—but there was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> “<hi rend="italic">Ball of Twist</hi>,” com. fine skain silk instead—the pair of stays is of <hi rend="italic">Dark</hi>, instead of white Jean as ordered.—The Calico is very much too fine, &amp; the Towellg. not at all liked as it shrinks &amp; gets hard—the Lamp chimnies being larger than the size ordered are useless, wh. I regret almost more than any thing. The 2 parcels of Books for Archd. WW &amp; Mr Baker are still here, &amp; are likely I fear to remain some time—as we have <hi rend="italic">very rarely </hi>any natives going that way, and no one wd. go purposely for less than ₤1. I perceive you have not charged yr. commiss. upon the 2 last orders; pray do not defraud yourselves of your doubly honest due.</p>
         <p>I now send you a rather long &amp; heterogenous order wh. I will thank you to get executed with as little delay as possible. To accomplish which I enclose the first of 2 Setts of Bills on the Socy., one for ₤50 &amp; one for ₤40, being all the Bill money I have at present by me;—adding thereto an order of my own in a note to the Secs. for ₤50., wh. I have little doubt they will considg. my sit. immy. pay: I send this open that you may see it; of course you will seal it for me ere you deliver it. But, shod. any demur be made on their part, you may either omit those goods marked xx in the margin of the order, or send them all &amp; credit me for a few months. I also enclose a Letter (unsealed) addressed to the Secy. of RTS. wh. I wish you to read &amp; deliver. For, although I have no influence in that quarter that I am aware of, they <hi rend="italic">may</hi> do something for me in the shape of Type, or Paper, wh. may lessen yr. outlay upon that head. If my good friend Mr Coates were now alive, I think I shod. not fail in my applicn. The Type (on the <hi rend="italic">separate </hi>order) must be Scotch, &amp; wh. you will obtain from Edinburgh (or Glasgow); as the Eng. I am sorry to say, (particularly Watts’) is not to be compared to it. Be sure that it <hi rend="underline italic">is accordg. to order</hi>; wh., in no one case during many years, has ever yet occurred. Among other things, you will find, that I have ordered <hi rend="italic">4 Black Frock Coats </hi>for myself; as there are now a variety of woollen stuffs manufactured of which I do not even know the name, it would I think be a good plan to have each Coat made of a difft. material—bearing in mind, that durability &amp; not fineness is the main thing required: send with each the name of the fabric, &amp; some pieces (or a half yard or so) of each stuff—always useful in the “bush” where rents are so common, and do the same with the <hi rend="italic">Tweed Trowsers</hi>, &amp;c.—Another article to wh. I wod. call yr partr. attention is the Fur cloak for myself—and which, after all, I think had better be made of some light strong fabric <hi rend="italic">lined</hi> with fur throughout. I cannot bear <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> upon my shoulders &amp; yet I require warmth. To tell you the truth I have a very great mind to have a kind of loose Pelisse instead of a Claok.—<hi rend="italic">But I leave this with you</hi>. Let the wine be <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">good</hi>. The B. wines had better be specified as such, as the duties here (on wines espy.) are <hi rend="italic">very heavy</hi>. Don’t forget the <hi rend="italic">Nuts</hi>.—As we have no fruit <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, we have long been on the tip-toe of expect. concg. them. Let the parcels be made up &amp; directed as requested—there are sevl. things in this order for different individuals, &amp; there wod. have been more had Dean’s Catalogue had Prices annexed to his articles instead of Blank ₤ s d. wh. always looks suspicious. The <hi rend="italic">Pict. Times</hi> I must give up: as I have no time to look at it &amp; cannot afford to pay so much yearly for old newspaper cuts: so, don’t send any more volumes after this current year.</p>
         <p>It wod. be worth tryg. by way of expert.—the packg. the goods in good strong outfit chests with lock &amp;c., the lids to be screwed down with 2 good screws &amp; well corded. Care being taken by the operator not to put the screw into his mouth, so as to cause it to rust within the wood. If the chests were made of coarse Cedar or mahogy. or any coarse dark wood they might be better still: at present all cases are a <hi rend="italic">complete waste</hi>, &amp; the expenses here increasingly <hi rend="italic">great</hi>. When you write pray inform me as to <hi rend="italic">Drawbacks</hi>, whether any cost upon them—for <hi rend="italic">what amount</hi> allowed—&amp; whether for <hi rend="italic">sundry</hi> articles <hi rend="italic">together</hi> such as soap glass wine &amp; paper. I have recently made up a Case of Dried plants &amp;c for Sir WJ Hooker, in which I have put a small parcel for my father under cover to you—wh. please receive &amp; forward.—And, should you receive the ₤50 from CMS. on my a/c, please advise the payment of ₤10. to my father, thro one of the Penz. Banks, at an early date; &amp; when about to send off give them timely notice, always pressing to have their enclosures at least <hi rend="italic">a week</hi> before you dispatch yr. goods. The Magic <hi rend="italic">Lantern</hi>, &amp;c, I must defer for the present. I will thank you to enquire the price per 100, or per 1000, of <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> those beautiful <hi rend="italic">colored</hi> cuts, &amp;c, which are done by Baxter the patentee—say of 12mo. size; and whether he provides the subject, if so at what extra charge;—I want, to begin with, a vivid little picture, <hi rend="italic">the burning of Ridley &amp; Latimer</hi>, &amp; another to illustrate the <hi rend="italic">martyrdom of Polycarp</hi>, the figures shod. be few, (not too small nor too crowded, to suit the comprehension of the N.Zr. There is a book published by the U.S. Exploring Expedition under the auspices of the US Government by Blanchard &amp; Lee, Philadelphia,—on ethnography &amp; philology; if you could pick it up any where for me (2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> hand wod. do) I shod. be obliged—it is a ponderous 4to. &amp;, I suppose, published at a high price. Let the silver pencil case be a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> one; &amp; the engravg. <hi rend="italic">well executed</hi>.</p>
         <p>You may add to a consid. extent and at any time upon such articles as Navy Blue Print, unbleached Calico, Red Cott. Hdkfs., do Cravats, striped shirts &amp; moleskin Trowsers; always bearing in mind that the articles are good. And <hi rend="italic">every autumn </hi>upon the arr. of the new fruit, send me, 50lbs <hi rend="italic">best</hi> currants, 2 14-pound boxes of Bloom R., 56 pounds of Valencia Raisins, 1 bush. walnuts, &amp; 1 bush. almonds &amp; Barcelona nuts, wh. might all I think go into <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Cask or Case. If you cod. ascertain whether Newfound. Cod would keep well in comg. hither, I shod. much like to get a hundred-weight. And if any more Blue Books are published respectg New Zealand, be sure to procure me a copy. I should like to get a Copy of every one wh. has been pubd., if I cod. get them cheap.</p>
         <p rend="end">Palliser Bay, Novr. 11/48</p>
         <p>There have been several shocks of earthquake here during the month all the Brick buildgs &amp; chimnies in Wellg. have suffered severely, but only 3 lives have been lost. Many however of the settlers have left; I must now conclude—</p>
