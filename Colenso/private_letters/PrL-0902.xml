         </p>
         <p>having been extra long sojourning there—partly owing to my own illness, &amp; partly to my remaining to see the end of funeral of a yg. fellow who was also ill in the same hotel with myself: indeed, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> were 4 down together—and I am the only one that recovered: it was a serious time, and I still feel the <hi rend="italic">weakening</hi> effects arising from my attack w. med. &amp; <hi rend="italic">low </hi>diet:—however I am pretty well.</p>
         <p>I had very nearly troubled, or surprized you w. a letter while there <hi rend="italic">re </hi>a living <hi rend="italic">taniwha</hi>! I closely examined the young man who saw it, and fired at it to save his dog swimming after a duck shot in the lagoon: but as it occurred in the shooting season of <hi rend="italic">93’</hi>—and had not been seen since—I dropped enquiry. I may however mention, that the young fellow’s story was a very coherent one, he, too, being respectable quiet &amp; of good report. He had told me the tale <hi rend="italic">last year</hi> at the time, and now the shootg. season coming on it was revived, to warn sportsmen concerning that spot. It is a lagoon, or deep swamp surrounded by high cliffy banks, with an outlet to R. Manawatu and not far from the bridge over that stream, road leading to the Weber District.</p>
         <p>Another party of two out riding, had also on a former occasion seen a beast there in the water swimming which they thought looked like a young colt, or some such animal.</p>
         <p>My informant was sure he wounded the creature about the angle of its mouth: it retreated to the <hi rend="italic">raupo</hi> on receiving the shot, and the dog returned in fear <hi rend="italic">sans</hi> duck! its head big, dark grey, about 18 in long.—</p>
         <p>The story was now well received, and Rev.E. Robertshawe (stout &amp; strong), Hill Inspr. Schools, and Bamford solicitor there, went thither to the said haunt next mg., in search—and they had a time of it!!!—nearly came to grief in descending cliffs, and got back <hi rend="underline italic">late</hi>—they won’t go again. We had much talk pro &amp; con. over the matter: I, of course, got laughed at for my unbelief: however, <hi rend="italic">Tempus revelat</hi>! I fancy <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will laugh over this.——</p>
         <p>           Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>                   W. Colenso</p>
         <p>I offd. the yg. man ₤5. for the creature—in any form.</p>
