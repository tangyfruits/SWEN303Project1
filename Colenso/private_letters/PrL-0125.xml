         <p>Secretaries,</p>
         <p>C. M. House</p>
         <p>Salisbury Sq.,</p>
         <p>London.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>1. I little thought when I wrote you my last Letter (dated the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> ulto.), that I should have so soon to write to you again, and that, too, concerning more trouble and disaster.—</p>
         <p>2. But so it is:—a few days only after the date of my last I was attacked with severe Rheumatism in my left face, ear, &amp; teeth, which continued, spite of all my applications local and internal, upwards of 3 weeks, causing me to spend a doubly melancholy Christmas and New Year’s day.—</p>
         <p>3. Nor was this all, for on Saturday the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. instant, about 3 pm, having less pain than heretofore, I was in my little detached Study in the end of my garden writing. As I wrote I thought I smelt something burning, but, as the Natives are almost always setting fire to the bush on all sides, I took little notice of it. The smell however becoming stronger, I dropped my pen &amp; went into the garden; here I saw smoke coming from the direction of the dwelling house, toward which I immediately went. On my way thither I heard Mrs. Colenso (who was running toward the Study by another path,) screaming out that the house was on fire! And, almost immediately, on clearing the trees I saw, that the fire had already got possession of the roof, <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>and, <hi rend="italic">that there was no hope</hi>!! I sickened at the sight; but rushing in, we, aided by two native girls, did, what we could. In a few moments some Natives from the neighbouring Village, (all who were there,) who had seen the fire perhaps before ourselves, had also joined us. But, owing to the extreme dryness of the materials, and the very high W. wind which unfortunately blew, (the fire, also, originating at the extreme W. end of the building,) we had scarcely 5 clear minutes for saving any portion of the property within.—And what we saved is scarcely worthy of mention in comparison with what has been destroyed. We only saved:— <hi rend="italic">from the dwelling house</hi>,—Mrs. Colenso’s workbox &amp; desk, a barrel organ, a <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of a Table, 1 little worktable, a few chairs, an old Sofa, the <hi rend="italic">loose</hi> bedding which was in use upon two bedsteads, our cloaks, the drawers of 2 chests of drawers, with most of the Clothes which happened to be in them, 2 footstools, a hearth rug, Fender &amp; fire irons:—<hi rend="italic">from the Surgery</hi>;—(of Medicines in use &amp; on the shelves—out of nearly 200 bottles and Jars, only,) scales and weights, 1 Bott. of Laudanum; 1 ditto Carb. Ammonia, 1 pot of opium, and a bottle of Sulpur—and a box of sundry medicines not in use:—<hi rend="italic">from the Carpenters Shop</hi>;—a very few tools which happened to be in the Tool Chest, (&amp; <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, unfortunately, of the most useful ones) a Vice, 2 saddles, and a box containing a few Medicines.—The fire burnt so rapidly, being heightened considerably by the violent wind which blew, which so filled the rooms &amp; neighbouring air with the densest smoke and burning heat; that <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>we were obliged &amp; quickly to abandon all hopes of saving any thing more. In less than 30 minutes all the buildings were down, although the fire burnt strongly until the next day, and, in some spots, till Monday Morning.</p>
         <p>4. Having saved what little we could from the Dwelling house, we hastened to the Study, for the safety of which we now had considerable fears. I have already stated, that this little building was at the end of the garden, between which &amp; the dwelling house were a number of Apple and other fruit trees, interspersed with living screens of bamboos, willow, elder &amp; acacia trees, some of which were upwards 20 feet high; (without these living screens we should not have had any fruit during the whole of our residence here, owing to the nearness of the place to the sea, and the violent winds which often prevail.) With a heavy heart and faltering step I tottered into the study—for it contained <hi rend="underline italic">much</hi> besides books &amp; papers, (there being all my dry and Natural Specimens. Printing Press, Type &amp;c., &amp;c.,) and I feared the worst. In my extremity I momentarily knelt and implored the Almighty to spare <hi rend="italic">this</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Zoar</hi>—this little one—already, as it were, beyond all human aid. By this time the <hi rend="underline italic">few</hi> Natives, mostly women, who thronged the door, were very clamorous, shouting the utter impossibility of saving the study, and entering, demanded what they should carry out. The danger was indeed most imminent: the flames and heat borne by the wind being so great that we could hardly stand at the study door, and the immense flakes <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>of fiery material which flew about falling every where and setting fire to the dry grass, &amp;c., on all sides, fearfully increased the danger. While Mrs. Colenso was getting every blanket &amp; woollen rag, even to the saved Hearth Rug, dipped in the neighboring Creek, wherewith to cover the thatched roof, the Natives were busy in lopping off branches from some of the trees for the same purpose, while I (being obliged to make a <hi rend="italic">hurried</hi> selection,) brought out my desk, boxes of Mss., Register Books &amp; Communion Plate,—a few extra Medicines, &amp; a copy of Encyclopædia Britannica,—while some kindly officious native upsetting my Type, left it to save the <hi rend="italic">Cases</hi>! At this moment the cry was raised of the Study roof being on fire! I rushed out, and, Oh! My <hi rend="smallcaps">God!</hi> It was indeed the case!! On fire in <hi rend="italic">two</hi> places; up above our reach burning rapidly away. That moment I shall <hi rend="italic">never</hi> forget. With my heart sunk below Zero, and eyes full of tears, I silently cried to <hi rend="smallcaps">God, </hi>and with the energy of despair, threw up a wet blanket towards the flaming roof. The wind returned it upon me. I threw it up again; it was again blown back. The natives, said, ’twas useless; the fire increased so fast.—I again threw it up ; and oh! as if spread out by angels’ hands, the wet blanket opened fully and covered the large patch of flame, which it kept under until a boy had mounted by the chimney, (our ladder and all our timbers &amp; poles being then, burning.) <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>The second patch which was still blazing away, I now succeeded in putting out with a garden rake. We now covered the roof with the wet woollen articles, and leafy boughs, and, although we experienced much anxiety, even until after midnight, this building <hi rend="italic">was</hi> preserved. Blessed be the name of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord!</hi> The fences were now burning rapidly communicating the fire by cross lines to every dry thing which would burn, of which, alas! at this (our driest) season there was no lack. Seeing no other way of stopping the fire we broke down some of the fences, in which work, including that of extinguishing, I was, although worn out and in pain, employed till near midnight—the natives having left us before Sunset.</p>
         <p>5. The few articles which we had saved we conveyed into the end of the weather-board store, (a building roughly boarded, not lined nor even planed,) in which we also took up our abode. Here we spent a melancholy Sunday; not having saved so much as a single cup or plate, knife or spoon, a bit of salt, or any article of food.</p>
         <p>6. Early on Monday morning I dispatched a Native to the Europeans living at Ahuriri (6 miles off), from whom we got a little salt, and a <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of a steel wheat mill (they not having any flour); and having in the meanwhile, got out some Earthenware and Ironmongery, and some little stoves, (which being <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>supernumerary were fortunately apart in the weather-boarded store,) in the course of a day or two we got into a kind of homely “bush” housekeeping, feeling our inconveniences, but thankful that they were no worse—that <hi rend="smallcaps">God </hi>had in mercy remembered us in our low Estate.—</p>
         <p>7. By this unfortunate fire I (as well as the Society) am a <hi rend="italic">great</hi> loser. All the many Household and domestic articles of Furniture of nearly 20 years gathering are gone! besides many stores,—such as,—Tea, Coffee, Sugar, Salt, Arrowroot, Sago, Flour, Oatmeal, Rice, Biscuit, Wine, Hams, Bacon, Pork, dried fish, preserved meats, &amp;c., in tins, Oil, Turpentine, Candles, pieces of Calico, Sheeting, Print, &amp;c., &amp;c., as well as all kinds of Wearing Apparel; about 100 vols. of Books, Silver Watch, ditto spoons, Clock, 2 steel wheat mills, new Harness, all my <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> Natural Collections in Spirits &amp; Acid, &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">many</hi> Medicines, Carpenter’s, Sawyer’s, &amp; Mason’s tools, a quantity of sawn &amp; seasoned timber—many fruit trees, including upwards of 200 fine 2-year old grafts and plants:—altogether (and <hi rend="italic">exclusive</hi> of the value of my Natural Collections, fruit trees, &amp; plants,) my loss is, to say the least of it, above <hi rend="italic">£300</hi>. Your loss, in addition to that of the premises, is that of the Medicines, the Pulpit &amp; Desk Cloths, a few stores, such as, a bell or two, Slates &amp; slate pencils, the oars and Sail of the Station boat, some extra window sashes <hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>unglazed),—but several of the foregoing you have not yet fully paid for.</p>
         <p>8. In addition to the dwelling house and portion of the Garden destroyed—there has been also burnt, the little barn behind with its contents, and all the small outhouses and offices, and a great deal of the house field and garden fences. The fire burnt with great fury, insomuch that all glass, and every brass article has been remelted, including even heavy bells of 12–14 lbs weight. I believe that there is nothing whatever, which can be of any Service hereafter, save the bricks in the 2 chimnies, which are still standing.—</p>
         <p>9. Another article of loss (though not ours) is a lot of new American Muskets, (18 or 20,) which some years ago I recovered from these Natives ( including Wiremu Tipuna) which they had plundered from the U.S. brig “Falco.” The powder (3 or 4 casks) which I had also got back from them was in the bee-house in the garden, whence Noah Huke, in the early part of the fire, courageously carried it in his arms to a more distant spot, burying it in the earth.—</p>
         <p> 10. But “deep calleth unto deep” as the Psalmist saith, and this I had yet more fully to prove. Before however I relate this, I would necessarily digress a little:—About 4 days before the<hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>calamitous fire, Mr. McLean, (the Government Land Agent &amp; Paymaster, &amp; principal Magistrate for this district,) had arrived at Ahuriri, whither nearly all the Natives at the time of the fire were; that day being the day in which the remainder of the purchase money of Ahuriri was paid. On the day preceding the fire, I had received a vague kind of intimation, from Micah Iwikatea, the N. Teacher at Patangata, to the effect, that his eldest brother, Wiremu Tipuna, had, at the instigation of Te Hapuka, the Popish Priest, and others, been induced to go to Mr. McLean and to prefer a charge against <hi rend="underline italic">me</hi> for assault!! This, however, knowing how Natives magnify things, I took little notice of. On the Sunday (the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>) I heard, that W. Tipuna had gone again to the Magistrate; and, on the next day (Monday), I was informed, that he had “<hi rend="italic">sworn</hi>” to his statements, &amp;c.;—and, at night, Micah (who had also been to Ahuriri) returned to fetch me to attend the Magistrate Court! I told Micah, that I was quite willing to do so, but, that I required to be summoned thither, either by a proper Officer, or in writing. Early on Tuesday morning Micah again returned to me, bringing a note from Mr. McLean requesting my attendance thither on that day. I was unwell in bed, (or, rather, in a blanket,) when he came, suffering much from Influenza, which was now very prevalent &amp; unusually severe. I, however, made an effort, got up, &amp; went with <hi rend="bold">[9] </hi>him to Ahuriri, Noah Huke, the N. Teacher at the Station accompanying us. There I received much <hi rend="italic">private</hi> kindness from Mr. McLean, who told me, that the Europeans were so much grieved at the case against me having been so pressed upon his notice, (<hi rend="italic">at such a time</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">too</hi>), contrary to their repeated requests to the plaintiff, and his friends the Heathen Chiefs, that they had all left the place, being not willing to remain to hear anything of it. (I had myself met several strolling away in different directions.) And, that even his brother Magistrate (Mr. Alexander) had gone away, declaring, that he could not sit to hear it. And, that Tareha, and all the Christian &amp; friendly Chiefs had strictly forbidden any of their people from attending. The Court being opened, Wiremu Tipuna (concerning whom his brother Micah had, on my way hither, told me, that he, (Micah) had trembled yesterday from head to foot, and became sick at hearing him take his oath &amp; relate his statements,) soon appeared, with Te Hapuku, Puhara, Morena, Te Hei, and other minor Heathen Chiefs, and again related his charge; the truth of which I denied, stating fully the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> matter to the Magistrate, (often interrupted by Te Hapuka, Morena, &amp; others.) His statement, however being corroborated (in a way!) by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> witness, I was to my utter surprise fined <hi rend="italic">Three Pounds</hi>!!! Which I refused to pay, let the consequences be what they <hi rend="bold">[10] </hi>may. Recovering from my surprise, I talked seriously (for I was most indignant,) before the Court and in Native to the Magistrate, telling him, among many other things, that it was through my exertions that he then quietly sat there that day on Government Land as a Magistrate. At Evening I returned, with my faithful Christian friend Noah Huke, to the remnant of what was once my home, weary &amp; in pain in body &amp; mind; with feelings not unlike those of Elijah when he sat in the wilderness under the juniper tree.—</p>
         <p>11. During the remainder of this week my disorder raged so high—being more than once delirious—that I scarcely expected to recover. By Sunday (the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) through <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> goodness, the worst of the malady was passed, and now Mrs. Colenso &amp; the little child, who had hitherto escaped, were both badly afflicted with it. I scarcely knew what to do; but <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> has, in mercy, brought us through this trying time, this fiery trial.—</p>
         <p>12. On my way back from Ahuriri, and during my illness, I greatly wished to write a Letter to the Magistrate; respecting the untoward matters which had called me to Ahuriri; and more particularly to place on record the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> respecting the same, that the reason why I refused to pay the fine levied, might be fully known, but I was not <hi rend="bold">[11] </hi>able. However, on my getting better I did so; although not in so satisfactory a manner as I could wish:—a Copy of which I enclose for your information.<note xml:id="ftn2-4" place="foot" n="4"> WC: Enclosure, No. 1.</note>
         </p>
         <p>13. I am, my dear Sirs, <hi rend="italic">much</hi> poorer than I was when I last wrote,—with prospects much darker. I have been and <hi rend="italic">am</hi> sorely chastened— “in mind &amp; body” <hi rend="italic">and</hi> “estate”—all coming together; but my hope is, with Job’s, <hi rend="italic">stayed upon Him</hi>.—Though <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> slay yet will I trust.— “Righteous art thou, O <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>, and true are thy judgements.” I already see an alteration in the Natives towards me; it being one of their old superstitious notions, that a burnt house, or Canoe upset, is caused by the immediate operation of the anger of Te Atua, which, with Mr. McLeans decision, and my grievous Rheumatic pains (not to mention my suspension), all coming together, is quite enough not only to cause them, but also, older Christians to think so.—</p>
         <p>14. I suppose, that you will not sanction the rebuilding of another Mission house <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and I have a much less desire to remain. Still I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> do so, as I have no other home, until, at least, I hear from you in answer to my last Letter of Decr.13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I intend (D.V.) making the little Study my residence, being apprehensive of expending any more money upon the matter of House building here.</p>
         <p>15. And, that I may not omit taking <hi rend="bold">[12] </hi>every little ingredient of the cup, some of my friends (?) or, rather, of my co-workers in the Mission field, have been stirred up to write most bitterly of, and to, me. From Mr. Baker, in particular, I have had a most cutting Letter; in which he calls me, “<hi rend="italic">hypocrite</hi>”— “<hi rend="italic">apostate</hi>,”—and I can scarcely tell what. I venture to enclose a copy of my letter to him,<note xml:id="ftn2-5" place="foot" n="5"> WC: Enclosure, No.2.</note> from which you will gain something more of my situation, and of my thoughts respecting it. Of course, when I wrote my letter to him, it was not intended for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> reading; but, as several matters have happened <hi rend="italic">since</hi>, and as I wish you to know fully my situation, I now send you a Copy. A <hi rend="underline italic">key</hi> I think I have to Mr. Baker’s superlative anger, namely in my letter to him when residing at Auckland—unfortunately with him for leaving <hi rend="italic">Uawa</hi>—pointing out what good Mr. Hadfield did for his Natives, during the many years he was an invalid, by remaining near them—and telling him, that I could not reconcile his two statements, of his being near to death, and yet so exceeding anxious to be Ordained; neither could I see why he should prefer going to the Bay of Islands, to returning to Uawa; unless it were for the residing upon and farming his own land at Waikare:—this plain and faithful speaking of mine, has, I believe, caused him to be <hi rend="italic">so</hi> angry.       I cannot but think how very much my situation may be compared with that of Job’s. I told you, in my last, that I had “but<hi rend="underline italic">few</hi> friends in N. Zealand;”—in fact, as far as I at present know, Mr. Cole, the Colonial Chaplain at Wellington, a kind and good man, is the most deserving of that appellation.— <hi rend="bold">[13]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>16. Two whole months have now elapsed since Mr. Hamlin publicly made known the Bishop’s sentence respecting me, during which we have heard nothing concerning Mr. S. Williams; consequently, the Natives have become quite unsettled, caring less and less about Divine Service; notwithstanding, no one has yet joined the Papists. I have done all in my power by letter and word of mouth to strengthen the. N. Teachers &amp; their people. The N. Teachers have been twice to me respecting the marriages of several young persons, it is not, however, in my power to answer them satisfactorily. I have lately begged them <hi rend="italic">to wait for one more full month</hi>; when, if no one comes something must be done. One old dying woman, who had long expressed a desire to be Baptized, but who (from her ignorance, and from her living here close to us,) has been put off, is now at the point of death, &amp; much grieved (with her friends &amp; powerful relations,) at her dying unbaptized. The dead, too, are buried by the N. Teachers. We seem to be living in old times again, when our forefathers were laid under an interdict. Had I followed the <hi rend="underline italic">pernicious</hi> “advice” given, and left <hi rend="italic">Ahuriri</hi>, I am sure the Natives would have<hi rend="underline italic"> </hi>been ten times worse. Even my usual little Annual order to the College Press for <hi rend="italic">Calendars</hi> &amp;c., for 1853, for the N. Teachers, has been withheld, instead of (as I should have thought) hastening to forward them.—I hope sincerely that if Mr. S. Williams is indeed coming here, he will soon make his appearance. <hi rend="bold">[14]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>17. It is now, I believe, 7 weeks since the E.D. Commee. met (as usual) at Turanga. I have not, however, yet heard from the Secretary, nor received what is due to me of my last year’s stipend. I cannot account for this, being so very contrary to all past usage. I feel it the more now in my present situation.—I hope they have not taken upon themselves to withhold it.</p>
         <p>18. I have heard that many of the Settlers are expressing much concern upon my account;—some of them (now) thinking that I am hardly dealt with. Others, I hear, have spoken of making a Collection for me; others have proposed, to purchase and present me with a piece of Land on which I could settle, in order to keep me in the District; while I have had it intimated to me by those who are in authority, that, if I memorialize the Governor, they are pretty sure that I shall have a sufficiency of ground granted to me in consideration of what I have done for the Natives. To all, however, I would wish to be deaf, until I hear from you. I hope, my dear Sirs, when you write, whether to the Bishop, to your Secretary Mr. Vidal, or to the Central Commee., that you will write plainly &amp; particularly upon <hi rend="italic">every</hi> point, so that there shall be nothing ambiguous, or so as to enable anyone here to act differently to your wishes.—</p>
         <p>19. Among the books destroyed in the fire I mourn particularly, Leighton’s works, Bp. Hall’s ditto, Ch. Missy. Records &amp; Registers from the year 1843 <hi rend="bold">[15] </hi>inclusive (with the exception of those mentioned in the margin);<note xml:id="ftn2-6" place="foot" n="6"> WC: <hi rend="italic">Record</hi>, pts. 1 &amp; 2, for 1851; <hi rend="italic">Register </hi>pts. 1 &amp; 2, for 1851,<hi rend="italic"> ditto</hi>, pts. 1 &amp; 2 for 1849, <hi rend="italic">ditto </hi>pt 1 for 1846, <hi rend="italic">ditto </hi>pt 2 for 1848, <hi rend="italic">ditto </hi>pt 2 for1850.</note> and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Intelligences and several reports; Graham’s Domestic Medicine, ditto, on diseases of females; Life of Bickersteth (only <hi rend="italic">lately</hi> arrived); D’Aubigne’s Histy of the Reformation; Johnson’s Rambler, ditto Idler; Wilson’s Evidences of Christianity; Jowett’s minor works—such as, Script. Characters, on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Prayer, &amp;c., &amp;c.—Fortunately my <hi rend="italic">most valuable </hi>books were all in the Study. I must not omit to mention, a large box of useful Religious Tracts, in the English, French, Dutch, Spanish, German and Irish languages, the liberal Gifts of the R.T.S. Perhaps you may be able again to supply me with your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> publications; the few saved happened to be in the Study.—</p>
         <p>20. A Case of N. Testaments sent from the B. &amp; F.B. Society through you to me, has very lately arrived at Ahuriri; but hitherto, I have not found means to get it here. The Natives generally suffering much from Influenza, which still prevails; with their wheat, which is more than ripe, still uncut, and no one to cut it.</p>
         <p rend="end">February 7<hi rend="sup">,</hi> 1853.</p>
         <p>21. I must now close &amp; send off this packet, as the vessel has arrived and is about to sail. I <hi rend="italic">little thought</hi>, during my long &amp; arduous struggle uphill in this Country, that I should ever be in such a situation as the present.—I do not mean with reference to the <hi rend="italic">suspension</hi>, or the decision &amp; fine levied by the Magistrate for I always knew <hi rend="bold">[16] </hi>that those powers were, in some degree at least, adverse to me,) so much as to other matters. Mr. McLean has since returned in a very great hurry to the W. Coast, (being sent for by the Governor,) where, I hear, at Rangitikei, some serious disturbance have broken out among the natives, who, after plundering a white man’s house, fired <hi rend="italic">ball</hi> upon the Magistrates who came to assist! He has not yet pounced upon any of my few things, nor answered my Letter. I almost fear, that he came hither with special instructions how to act; and this I surmise from a few things I have heard &amp; noticed. Among others (Mr. McLean himself informed me,) that Te Hapuku had written repeatedly about it to Wellington both to him &amp; to the Governor, (some of the letters were, <hi rend="italic">I know</hi>, taken thither, if not written by, the P. Priest,) and I know, that the Government greatly wishes to reduce the Missionary influence as much as po<hi rend="italic">s</hi>sible—the Natives being publicly taught (in the Newspaper published in their language by the Government,) <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go to the Missionary concerning anything of a civil or Criminal nature. He also, informed me, (as I have already stated in par. 10.) that his brother Magistrate would not remain in Court to hear the Case:—why? unless he knew from Mr. McLean <hi rend="italic">how</hi> it had already been predetermined.<hi rend="italic"> I</hi> told Mr. McLean, that had I known it would so have terminated, I would not have come thither. Again: when at Wairarapa last year I was informed by our N. Teacher, that a Gentleman there, a Magistrate, had been telling <hi rend="bold">[17] </hi>some of their people, whom they had justly put out of School (for Crime), to appeal to the Government against both the Teachers and myself—that they were British subjects, and <hi rend="italic">we </hi>could not treat them as slaves,—that we had no power to exclude from Church or Communion, &amp;c.—Now, Mr. McLean only comes here once a Year; he knows nothing (individually) of these Natives, and, it is his sole aim to keep in with and please Te Hapuku &amp; his relations— the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> principal Chief who is determined to sell <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Land. My influence is now, however, <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>! Should any unfortunate outbreak ever take place, or a vessel founder off, or be wrecked on these shores, I would not now exert myself, as it would be useless, unless it should please the Governor <hi rend="italic">publicly</hi> to reverse the unhappy decision of Mr. McLean. The Magistrates settled here are powerless; they are just in the situation Mr. Busby was in the Bay of Islands— “a man-o’-war without guns.” The Natives have told me, that they will not listen to them; and they (the Magistrates) knowing their weakness, have told the Chiefs that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> must settle their own matters among themselves! In a recent case of theft, when some iron was stolen from one of the Magistrates, he sent after it, but could not get it back; <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> which I sent, got it back, and made the thief take it in person to him, with some baskets of potatoes as a compensation; upon which Mr. Alexander wrote me a note—which I may as well copy for your information.<note xml:id="ftn2-7" place="foot" n="7"> WC: Enclosure, No.3.</note>

         <p>22. I quite believe that these <hi rend="bold">[18] </hi>Natives, especially the Heathen, will become worse than they have ever yet been. They cannot bear that immense lifting-up which the Government gives them. The advance is unnatural: Nature, and <hi rend="italic">true</hi> Civilization advances by degrees. The evils arising therefrom are not, perhaps, so perceptible, nor so great <hi rend="italic">in &amp; near towns</hi>, where, in the bulk of the Settlers, they have both an example &amp; a counterpoise.—When I was at Ahuriri, (on the 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> ulto.) a poor Shepherd was fined £<hi rend="italic">4</hi>., besides expenses, for <hi rend="italic">playing</hi> with the loose heathen wife of the heathen Chief Morena; although it was very clear, that the woman was much more in fault than the man. Mr. McLean declared, that he would have the Native females paid as great decorum as the White ones. This is very good in theory and sounds well; but <hi rend="italic">it cannot be carried out</hi>, as the sequel will shew. I asked the Magistrate permission to speak, which being granted, I addressed both him and the Chiefs present, stating as my opinion, that in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> cases where Native women <hi rend="italic">stroll away to the Settlers huts</hi>, inviting, &amp;c., and mischief ensues, the fault should be laid at <hi rend="italic">her</hi> door, and no compensation given to her, or her people. This of course, was mocked at by the Heathen Chiefs, especially by Morena &amp; Hapuku. Now <hi rend="italic">I knew</hi> Morena’s plan which he had laid; having written to him, in August last, against it. And sure enough, as soon as Mr. McLean had left, he put it in practice, taking another woman to wife, <hi rend="italic">retaining the former</hi>. Now this <hi rend="bold">[19] </hi>second wife, although <hi rend="italic">unmarried according to British Law</hi>, cannot take another husband, neither would Morena allow her to do so; he has, therefore, committed <hi rend="italic">bigamy</hi>; which, however, though a grave offence with us, Mr. McLean cannot interfere with! This exclusive system cannot work well long. Especially now that these Natives have seen <hi rend="italic">me</hi> fined (whom they foolishly thought to be above Law,) they will be more zealous than ever in promoting schemes by which to get money.——Two days ago, I heard of gold having been found <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in Hawkes Bay near Table Cape! by a person who saw it. This will be a new source of much evil.—On the night of the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> inst., one of Hapuku’s wives (he has eight), destroyed herself, in a fit of shame and jealousy, by strangling. All these things, however varied, only point <hi rend="italic">one</hi> way.—</p>
         <p>23. I, yesterday, heard our N. Teacher, Noah Huke, give two very good and seasonable addresses; that, in the morning, from 1 Cor. xiii. 13; and that, in the evening, from Ps. xxxiv.ii. Unfortunately the Congregation, (although larger than it has been on any Sunday during the new year), scarcely amounted to 30 including Children. I have seen of late, more than ever, the great value of my Teacher’s School.</p>
         <p>24. I trust, my dear Sirs, that you will not (from what I have herein written &amp; enclosed) suppose, that it is my wish that you should in any way oppose either the Governor or the Bishop,—or <hi rend="bold">[20] </hi>your servant Mr. Baker.—Such is very far indeed from being my desire. I have merely stated some facts, (with a few remarks of my own,) that you may know the true state of the whole matter.—</p>
         <p>25. In conclusion I have a request to make, which I hope you will grant—especially as you will see how very much I have had of writing lately. Namely,<hi rend="italic"> to get a copy taken for my Father of my Letter to the Magistrate, and</hi>
            <hi rend="underline"> </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">sent to him at an early opportunity</hi>. In my Letter to him I have stated that I should make this request to you.—</p>
         <p>Hoping to hear fully from you soon—and craving an interest in your prayers, both for myself and <hi rend="italic">the Natives </hi>of this district—now more than ever needed.—I am,</p>
         <p>My Dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>Your obliged &amp; attached</p>
         <p>Though <hi rend="italic">unworthy</hi> Servant,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
