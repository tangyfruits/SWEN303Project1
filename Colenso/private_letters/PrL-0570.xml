         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>August 2/84</p>
         <p>My dear Sir G. Grey</p>
         <p>I came down to town this morning half expecting to have the pleasure of seeing you, and have heard you are not coming on shore.—</p>
         <p>I wish to hand you a copy of a little “Ruahine” book, to which you so liberally and promptly subscribed. I had corrected for press the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>page on Thursday night, and I begged of the Printer, as a favour, to let me have one copy early this morning <hi rend="italic">for you</hi>—should you arrive. I now send it, &amp; hope you may also approve of this one.—</p>
         <p>The remaining 5 copies for you I retain until I hear from you, or of your return to your quiet retreat at Kawau.—</p>
         <p>I write this in haste <hi rend="italic">here </hi>under much disadvantage, and hoping you are enjoying good health, I am—</p>
         <p>with every respect,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
