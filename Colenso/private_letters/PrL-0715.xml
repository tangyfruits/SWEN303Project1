         <p rend="end">Napier, April 30th, <lb/>1889.</p>
         <p>Mr. D.P. Balfour, <lb/>Glenross.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Your kind letter of 27th came to hand last night (brought up to me in bed!)—and having this day looked into contents of the accompanying little box, I write at once—though in no mood for letter-writing or for anything else—for delays are dangerous.</p>
         <p>1.) The little plant that gives you so much annoyance on your run—is a sp. of <hi rend="italic">Gnaphalium</hi> &amp; very like G. collinum—or one very near it: that sp., &amp; G. involucratum, are said by Hooker to have many varieties, and so cause much <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>!</p>
         <p>It grows plentifully on all the high &amp; dry &amp; stony grassy plains inland—in some spots forming mats or carpets some feet ac., and, curiously enough, I brought away in the Summer from beyond Dannevirke several specimens of it for Exam.—thinking it to be a distinct sp. from collinum—but I have not yet taken them up: I hope to do so, during winter, &amp; if I do, will let you know. It is a <hi rend="italic">perennial</hi>, &amp; therefore is likely to fight bravely for existence.</p>
         <p>2.) Carmichelia tips, these are common enough, with that shrub in particuilar, and these are either <hi rend="italic">Diseased</hi> tissue, or which is more likely are arising from the punctures of minute flying insects in depositing their eggs within.—Some, but larger ones, an Hoheria I brought away—7–9 years ago, watched them until the perfect insects were developed. There is a small thin leaved <hi rend="italic">Coprosma</hi>, that grows in wet &amp; low spots, whose leaves <hi rend="italic">at</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">tips</hi> are served in a similar way.</p>
         <p>Pleased to hear you could <hi rend="italic">again</hi> find <hi rend="italic">something</hi> good in the <hi rend="italic">Ruahine</hi> book; also, of your having received the little tract containing 3 letters: (You will see Mrs. Marshall’s reply in “D.T.” of last Saturday). You, my dear Sir, are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the only one who wishes me to write <hi rend="italic">more</hi> re Days gone by; but to do so, &amp; to publish the same, takes both time <hi rend="italic">and</hi> money, the former I could give bide a wee. Harding has nearly finished my new tract (Paper on “Tide lore”, &amp;c.) By mid. of May I hope it will be for sale—at <hi rend="italic">low</hi> price of 2/6.</p>
         <p>I have been a consid. loser by all I have pub. here, particularly by my “Jub. Paper”—rather <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi>—I am thinking of something of kind, when <hi rend="italic">next </hi>is issued—to let the world know I shall be ready to get out a vol. (100 papers at least) re Early Days &amp; adventures,—at a fixed sum to subscribers, but <hi rend="italic">first</hi> I must have 100 (or more) subscribers,—but of this anon. I fear shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be able to get away to Bush this Autumn! <hi rend="italic">I feel the need </hi>of it. Have not been well for some time—<hi rend="italic">very much</hi> of Rheumatism, Neuralgia, &amp;c. &amp;c.—so that my days have been &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">are</hi> imbittered—It was pain that drove me to bed last night at vii—have lost much time lately. Have been working (off &amp; on) at Hill’s last Tongariro plants, Some new ones. </p>
         <p>Glad to hear you are <hi rend="italic">all well.</hi> May such long continue at Glenross.</p>
         <p>Kind regards </p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
