         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>July 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. 1871</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I received your telegram of yesterday, which I acknowledged, and now send you, enclosed, a copy of the Note (top Essay) on the case of Karaka poisoning I had referred you to. I have copied it <hi rend="italic">in extensor</hi> as you will see. I felt pretty sure that you could not have those “<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>,” (the appendix to the essay which was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> printed,) but the fault (if any) arose from your telegram of 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. ulto having— “your <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> in Essay are hardly full enough.”</p>
         <p>By the bye, would not those “Notes” suit the pages of the present vol. of “Transactions”? I humbly think they would: they are interesting and elucidatory and not unscientific, and all more or less of a popular character; and could be very well made to refer to essay in 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. vol., to which indeed they belong.—</p>
         <p>If you agree, and will use them at once, let me know by telegram, and I will (once more!) copy them. I did so, you may remember, 2 years ago, for Dr. Hooker, (of Prof. Huxley), Dr. H. in reply said, he had read them and sent them to the Ethnological Sy.</p>
         <p>A little error of the telegraphist in your 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. tel. about the Karaka made me laugh; he commences,— “Am investigating Karaka <hi rend="italic">position</hi>” (? for poison).</p>
         <p>Believe me ever</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
