         <p rend="end">Napier Xmas Day 1883</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>Glenross</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,—If I am to write to you by this weeks mail, I must e’en do so <hi rend="italic">today.</hi> I returned on Friday last (21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>) to N, from the “Bush”, &amp; found your ever-welcome &amp; friendly letter awaiting me, with a lot of others. <hi rend="italic">Yours</hi> I read the same night; some of the English ones I did not. I was glad to find you had <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> your main shearing, &amp; were, all hands, so well &amp; hearty. How you managed to get through I cannot understand—that is, if you had anything of the wet weather we had a little further S.</p>
         <p>I had my usual luck (!) of rain &amp; high winds, only 1 really fine day!! that was Saturday 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,—still, I did my best—fighting for it, &amp; getting wet, &amp;c, &amp;c. I got 2–3 additional Orchids, which I hope are new,—<hi rend="italic">one</hi> in particular, greatly pleases me, from the fact of my not having seen one for more than 40 years. It is a <hi rend="italic">Caladenia</hi>,<note xml:id="ftn3-218" place="foot" n="218">
               <hi rend="italic">Caladenia variegata</hi> Col.</note> &amp; a rare beauty, though, apparantly, closely allied to N.S.W. species. I came upon it unawares in a thick wood; many were growing erect (8–10in) from a rotting Moss covered log—<hi rend="italic">Fagus.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">C.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">minor</hi> is pretty common in the Bay of Islands, on the open clayey fern hills, &amp; is much smaller than this spn. Then I have also, a <hi rend="italic">Microtis</hi>, &amp; a <hi rend="italic">Thelymitra</hi> (or 2?)<note xml:id="ftn3-219" place="foot" n="219"> Probably <hi rend="italic">Thelymitra nemoralis</hi> Col. and <hi rend="italic">T. purpureofusca</hi> Col.</note>—but I was too early for th­em—as, owing to the wetness &amp; coldness of the season, everything was late! Frost, one night. Strawberries only just colouring; fire in my room, &amp; wearing my cloak, &amp;c, indoors!.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, however, today (&amp; yesterday) it is just a little too hot; Therm at 75, &amp; close &amp; sultry,with a little rain this afternoon.</p>
         <p>I regret your “Divots” not blossoming this year; are they in a natural position? i.e. sheltered from high winds, &amp; not too much exposed to sun? I won’t attempt to tell you how pleased I was, in finding I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of­fended your National feelings with my “Tract No 1”; thanks, many, for all you have so kindly said. You will see, in the “Herald” of yesterday, Mr D.T. out again in <hi rend="italic">his way</hi>—<hi rend="italic">against</hi> the band in our Bot Garden on Sun­day last!. People say in town yesterday, there was <hi rend="italic">too</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">much</hi> of <hi rend="italic">self glorification</hi>, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I have had but little doubts as to Mr T &amp; his small party, so strenous­ly striving to get some <hi rend="italic">old</hi> &amp; ⅔rd worn out Minister from the S to fill his place,—fearing a new &amp; better informed one from Home. How­ever, this will cure itself—<hi rend="italic">in time.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Most gladly do I send you a copy of the <hi rend="italic">pamphlet</hi> for your Station Lib adding thereto (with your permission) a copy of “Tract No 1”. I can give you ½ doz of these, should you wish for them. D &amp; Co did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> serve me well (fairly) in their sale. I had paid them over £20 for printing, &amp;c, &amp; they were to sell them for me, at so much a copy, but to <hi rend="italic">please</hi> cer­tain folk, they soon put them away from the counter, on a back shelf; so, I cleared them <hi rend="italic">all</hi> off.</p>
         <p>I have had a great call for them of late,—½ doz copies will be sent on Thursday to one gentleman here in town. And as I am on this subject of my tracts &amp; pamphlets, I may ask,—did I ever send you one on <hi rend="italic">Kereopa</hi>?<note xml:id="ftn3-220" place="foot" n="220"> Colenso W 1871. <hi rend="italic">Fiat Justitia; being a few thoughts respecting the Maori prisoner Kereopa now in Napier gaol....</hi> Dinwiddie, Morrison &amp; Co, Napier. (First published in <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi>.) 23p.</note> let me know.</p>
         <p>(remainder of letter dated Xmas Day 1883). </p>
         <p>Private</p>
         <p>And now my <hi rend="italic">working month</hi> for our Society is at hand,—to get out Report A/c, order books, hold 2 Councils (or more), and give notice of my <hi rend="italic">resig­nation</hi>. It grieves me to do <hi rend="italic">this</hi>—more than words can express—but I see no help for it. By dint of hard work—constant—I managed to steer our ship through 1883. I cannot attempt to do so any longer, un­less things greatly alter, of which I see no present likelihood. Our Society is, perhaps, the worst off in Napier, for want of confederation—clanship, or <hi rend="italic">Esprit de corps.</hi> Were but some of our <hi rend="italic">Country</hi> members re­siding here, including yourself, John Stewart, Hy Nairne, Tanner, &amp; a few others, we might do.</p>
         <p>Just before I went inland, I sent Dr Hector our <hi rend="italic">only</hi> paper for 1883; adding, that <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was a mere chance, through our last meeting having been postponed for a month, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Now I must close, though “I have not half said my say”. I hope you are all <hi rend="italic">well</hi> &amp; enjoying yourselves; and with my very kindest regards to you &amp; to yours all,—I heartily wish you a <hi rend="italic">Happy New Year</hi>, with many returns of the same.</p>
         <p>Believe me to be</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p>Keep your eye open for Orchid <hi rend="italic">flower.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>P.S. A small case of Books for our Instit to hand yesterday, shipped at London 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Oct</p>
