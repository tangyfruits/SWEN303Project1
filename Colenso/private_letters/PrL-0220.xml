         <p rend="end">Napier July 27 1867</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Since my last hence to you, I have received 2 letters from you—one, of 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. inst., with <hi rend="italic">six </hi>copies of my Botanical Essay in sheets—for which welcome sight I thank you much. But, please, inform me, when you next write—whether <hi rend="italic">I am to expect any more copies</hi>,—as, until I know, I cannot give away one. I ask this, because you do not tell me any thing about it in your letter: you say, indeed, “you had recommended that a certain number should be circulated without delay, &amp; the remainder reserved until the rest of the essays are printed, when they will be issued in one volume.”—But, to whom? Dr. Eccles, in an official letter of May 15/66, says— “Dr. Hector did not mention that you wished more than <hi rend="italic">50</hi> copies of ea. of your essays, <hi rend="italic">to which you</hi> (in common with each of the essayists) <hi rend="italic">are entitled</hi>—of his own essay.”—</p>
         <p>I also wish very much to get copies of <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>the other essays when printed, particularly of Munro’s. Please, my dear Sir, remember this.</p>
         <p>Then I have also yours of the 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. inst., for which I am very much obliged, and I am sure Dr. Hooker will be to you for the seeds so kindly forwarded—especially if he gets them still possessing vitality.—</p>
         <p>I hope I have not given you too much additional trouble in teasing you about my missing sheets of <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> (Lexicon). It is most mysterious, to me,—what has become of it. <hi rend="italic">Nolus volens </hi>I must go in for 2 days real search over <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my papers (Mss. printed &amp; blank)—and, then, if I find it not, I must e’en set to again on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> part. Don’t, pray, trouble the Nat. Dept., about it.</p>
         <p>You tell me, that the Indices (Maori &amp; Latin) to the Flora, I received, were “only <hi rend="italic">very rough proofs</hi>:” of course I could not know this, as <hi rend="italic">no</hi> letter came with them, &amp; besides they (4 copies) were cut &amp; trimmed to suit, enclosed in an envelope &amp; franked from the <hi rend="italic">Secy’s.</hi> off.—so that I did not know that they came from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, rather from <hi rend="italic">Mantell</hi>. You say “You are going to republish the Maori Index to the Flora,” &amp; ask for my contribution. This I shall <hi rend="italic">gladly</hi> give: but, I confess, I dislike a heap of crude names &amp; remarks from Settlers every where—even to women—ignorant of Maori, &amp; who may have received their so-called information from Maories just as ignorant. For, in this respect, the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> generation of Maories is far inferior to the past &amp; passing ones. I do not like to correct others’ errors in Maori names—I would rather expunge them altogether. I notice not a few names &amp; remarks of this kind in Hooker’s <hi rend="italic">recent</hi> vol., which I would were not there. But as your Printing Office must be very busy just now (in fact, I do not understand how you are to get the essays printed until the Assembly is prorogued,) I suppose you will not be able to republish your Index for some time. Be this as it may, <hi rend="italic">I shall most willingly help you in it. </hi>Let me know what you wish me to do.</p>
         <p>I am <hi rend="italic">much interested</hi> in your <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> debates in the House. Can you send me a sp. of <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllum unilaterale</hi>? <hi rend="italic">If 2</hi>, then one of the large, &amp; one of the small vars.</p>
         <p>Believe me, ever,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
