         <p rend="end">Napier, October 23rd. <lb/>1884.</p>
         <p>A. Luff Esq.,<lb/>  Wellington.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir, </p>
         <p>Here on my writing table is a memo. (of 3 lines) dated “Augt. 28”, in which the writer said—“a <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> later on”. And now just 2 months have since passed away, &amp; <hi rend="italic">no</hi> letter. That writer was Mr. A. Luff.—–</p>
         <p>However, I have heard from him <hi rend="italic">since</hi>, in a Paper (Wgn.) he kindly sent me, containing some <hi rend="italic">old</hi> extracts of nearly 50 years ago! At first I was a wee bit surprised, but I soon <hi rend="italic">absorbed</hi> it all! and it took me back to <hi rend="italic">those old</hi> days. Much of it is correct, in the main, though improved upon &amp; embellished (in a way) as <hi rend="italic">such</hi> things always were: there was one error (or more) but only one I will notice, that about a Mr. W.R. Wade being “<hi rend="italic">the Superintendent of the Press</hi>,” (that post was mine: I <hi rend="italic">still</hi> have the old official letter of appointment.)—And I think it came about in this way:—all the early Ch. of Engd. Missionaries had to bear some particular appointment, (some calling, trade, or profession, in addition to that of Teacher,)—and so, Mr. W., who was in N.Z. but a short time, &amp; who had been for some years a clerk, or Under-Secretary, in the C.M. House, (where I had seen him,) for want of some other title, bore that; but this is supposition;—he never did anything in that way.</p>
         <p>That you had sent to me, soon got re-printed in most of the papers in this place &amp; Country districts—with all its errors!<note xml:id="ftn3-265" place="foot" n="265"> See for instance <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi>, 26 September 1894.</note>
         </p>
         <p>Since then, you, there, were edified with Mr. Samuel’s question, &amp; Mr. Ballance’s answer <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the Mao. Lexicon! Seeing they were <hi rend="italic">both</hi> wrong (as <hi rend="italic">new </hi>hands on <hi rend="italic">old</hi> matters) I sent them (&amp; Members) copies of that Parly. Paper respecting it, (&amp; one, also, to the <hi rend="italic">Governor</hi>,) that they might know a little of the truth &amp; facts.<note xml:id="ftn3-266" place="foot" n="266"> Compilation of Maori Lexicon by Mr. Colenso (letters relative to). <hi rend="italic">Appendices to the Journals, House of Representatives</hi>, G11, 1875.</note> I may tell <hi rend="italic">you </hi>that your good friend Capt. Russell, told me when <hi rend="italic">here </hi>that he had laboured to set them right: and now, <hi rend="italic">this morng</hi>. from a line in the “Herald”, I find the “Times” has an Article—about it, or <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Well, we know that the “Times” was Atkinson’s <hi rend="italic">paid </hi>paper, and his near relative (now in the “Lords”), always a great hand in Newspaper Editing and writing, (J.C.R.) whose name is also brought forward, in not the best light, in that Py. paper, has, I suppose, come out with an Article, to the rescue of them both. All right! my bonnies, only be assured of this—“<hi rend="italic">that great is Truth &amp; will prevail</hi>.”—–</p>
         <p>I have long been desirous of going inland—to the “Bush”—but hitherto have been <hi rend="italic">hindered</hi>—by <hi rend="italic">other people’s matters</hi>. I purpose, however, leaving for Norsewood, on the 28th., &amp; remaining there till (say) 10th. Novr.—so, if you should be inclined to write, a letter would find me there. I may add that I purpose going thither again about Xmas. or the New Year: &amp; still <hi rend="italic">later</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">on</hi> (D.V.) to Woodville.—</p>
         <p>I hope you &amp; yours are all well. The weather seems <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to be settled fine. Lots of able men <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of employ! &amp; going about begging food! &amp; “tired of life!” Several new Houses erecting in town, particularly in Emerson St. and (horror!) a big Blacksmith’s Shop in Tennyson St., just opposite Masonic Hall! With very kind regards,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
