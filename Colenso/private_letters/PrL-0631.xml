         <p rend="end">NAPIER, August 11/86</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your kind, full &amp; welcome letter of the 8th I duly received, and now (my first spare moment—if indeed, “spare”one! I hasten to reply—this being out going Eng mail week via S.F., and I have more than usual to write, and nothing done yet.</p>
         <p>Yesterday I had to go to town, &amp; I called on Treasurer &amp; Council member Bowerman for your Vol XVIII—he assured me it was sent to you <hi rend="italic">by post last</hi> week, but (I fancy) <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the Thursday Eng. I hope you will duly get it tomorrow. Another matter I had with Bowerman was, to know <hi rend="italic">who supplied</hi> the “Herald” with the shameful report of our meeting on Monday night, which was <hi rend="italic">again</hi> cut down and diluted (lowered, as <hi rend="italic">usual</hi> of late) in the “D.T.” of last evening, but B did not—or would not—know.</p>
         <p>I was really astonished this mg in seeing (by the merest chance) a copy of the <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi> paper “Evening News” of yesterday, containing a fair &amp; <hi rend="italic">reasonable</hi> rep of our meeting, and the result is, that I have sent and got 1 doz copies, for distribution &amp; may become a subscriber. I send you a copy w. this.</p>
         <p>Our meeting was really a good one, &amp; well attended, and kept up till 10.30. 1 could wish <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (as a lover of Nature) had been there. A <hi rend="italic">large</hi> number of good, pleasing &amp; interesting <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> objects, and several <hi rend="italic">unique</hi> Maori ones. In reading my paper on G Lizards, I added a short supplement on yours—as communicated by you. With this I shall post that No of “Nature” &amp; I think you may keep it (If you should wish to do so), as I have another copy. I don’t know how I came to <hi rend="italic">omit</hi>, in mine to you of July 13th, all mention (as you say) of the 2 young Lizards—they were born early in June &amp; my paper was written about them to be read at meeting on 12th July—but did not go. I suppose it was owing to my having so much to do &amp; the G. Lizard subject <hi rend="italic">between</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">us</hi> being old.</p>
         <p>I am sure that <hi rend="italic">your</hi> congratulations are <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi>—<hi rend="italic">real</hi>, &amp; I fully endorse Mr Heaths opinion that it is an honour to the Colony, District, &amp; Town—as well as to your old friend!. I may tell you more when we meet, and I do hope you will <hi rend="italic">call</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> a while, when in town &amp; <hi rend="italic">see</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>The Gov have served me shabbily in this matter of the Mao Lex—in a late letter from them they coolly tell me—they “had dealt frankly &amp; liberally w me, in their gladly consenting to my going on with the work without pay” &amp;c &amp;c. But more anon.</p>
         <p>I purpose going to the “Hielands” early in Sept in quest of my dear Crypts, in <hi rend="italic">fruit</hi>. You will see something of my <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in vol XVIII.—</p>
         <p>Your address is correct enough—but there is <hi rend="italic">no need</hi> of it in <hi rend="italic">common</hi> correspondence.—</p>
         <p>P.S. In town this morning I hear from Mr Kinross White that Mrs Kinross has gone S.</p>
