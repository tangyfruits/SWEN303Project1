         <p rend="end">Napier, Jany. 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. 1872</p>
         <p>Dr. Julius Haast,<lb/>&amp;c  &amp;c  &amp;c.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I will write to you (<hi rend="italic">con amore</hi>) my <hi rend="italic">first </hi>letter of the New Year! in reply to yours of 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. December, received two days ago:—for which, and for the accompanying Papers, containing your new Paper on the Moa and Moa Hunters, I have to thank you.—</p>
         <p>First, let me offer you the compliments of the season: heartily wishing that <hi rend="italic">this </hi>year may prove more successful to you in Geological Palæontological &amp; Ethnological results than any past one has been.</p>
         <p>I have read <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> with very great interest your new Paper and rejoice w. you in all your researches &amp; new Discoveries—believing you have yet more in store.</p>
         <p>I should greatly like to see Dr. Hector’s Paper on the Moa, also Mr Murison’s—of both which I know nothing. (I suppose they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> printed separately.) Of Sir G. Grey’s Letter to the Zoologl. Socy., also mentioned by you, I am equally ignorant.</p>
         <p>You ask me to give you my opinion as to certain statements made by some Writer in the Lyttleton Times,—<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. “that there are wooden carved boxes in the Northern Island in the hands of celebrated Chiefs in which <hi rend="italic">Moa </hi>feathers were (and probably at present are) still preserved.—Such statements have been made also by Mr Davies in Auckland, as I have been informed.”—</p>
         <p>I wish you had sent me a copy of the said “L. Times,” containing the Letter referred to.—<lb/>       1. Does the writer say,<hi rend="italic">he has seen the Boxes</hi>?<lb/>       2. Does he say,<hi rend="italic">he has seen the feathers</hi>?<lb/>Even if thus far in the affirmative, (I have been so sadly bored in past years with statements repeatedly made by<hi rend="italic">unscientific </hi>individuals as to plants, minerals, &amp;c., that I would ask,) Is he a person <hi rend="italic">qualified </hi>to pass an opinion on such feathers?</p>
         <p>For my own part I greatly doubt the correctness of all such statements. I never once met with, or heard of, any thing of the kind in “the olden times” in all my rambles (&amp; enquiries) in the <hi rend="italic">N. </hi>Island.</p>
         <p>Could you not write to Mr. Davis, &amp; get all the information you can? (I don’t know him.)</p>
         <p>I do not greatly marvel at Sir G. Grey’s Letter,—as I have little doubt but that Sir George heard something of the kind from the “1000 aids” of his Government <hi rend="italic">employees</hi>,—all, more or less, ignorant of natural science, and all desirous of pleasing, &amp;c, &amp;c. And, the <hi rend="italic">old </hi>rule of Maori etiquette must not be lost sight of here—<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. of commonly assenting to leading questions, especially when asked by a superior—and, indeed, such was often done to put a stop to importunity &amp;c, &amp;c. I doubt, however, if Sir G. Grey made, or followed up, thos enquiries <hi rend="underline italic">himself</hi>: I don’t see how he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have done so.</p>
         <p>Of Mr Walker’s statements concerning the Legends of the Friendly Islands, I had heard before—long ago. Indeed, it is in print somewhere—<hi rend="italic">I have seen it.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I note you make me to say— “that I would translate differently the Maori Proverb <hi rend="italic">te Moa kai hau</hi>, &amp;c., although I don’t give you my translation.” Now if I were to give you what <hi rend="italic">may </hi>be the <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> of those words, (not merely a translation of them,—which was given to the world by Sir G. Grey some 15 years ago, and whence, I suppose, Mr. Stack obtained it,) I should be obliged to go deeply into the whole matter—its entire Paleology, including Exegesis &amp; Etymology, stretching far away into the cognate Polynesian Dialects, and into the long <hi rend="italic">past</hi>! in fact, to write a tolerably lengthy Paper, or disquisition, on the Paleology of the extinct Moa. This would take some time, which I cannot (now) give it,—besides, I want <hi rend="italic">more light</hi>—which I am in quest of. I have, however, often thought of taking it up. But, oh! there is so much of this once noble Language now completely <hi rend="italic">Dead</hi>! that, <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>, it is almost heart-breaking. Every day shews me more and more receding for ever from one’s grasp.—And now that the Colonial Government has <hi rend="italic">completely</hi> thrown me overboard (see “<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi>,” 1871, vol.xi, p.669,—only for “March last,” read, March 1870, having received no pay from them since that time—March <hi rend="italic">1870</hi>;) I am obliged, once more, to turn my attention to other matters, and to look after my own <hi rend="italic">private</hi> affairs, long neglected; so that, I fear, I shall <hi rend="italic">never </hi>finish what I <hi rend="italic">once </hi>fondly hoped to do.</p>
         <p>I send you a pamphlet just printed—<hi rend="italic">portions</hi> of which may interest you a little.</p>
         <p>And Believe me</p>
         <p>Ever truly yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
