         <p>Mr John Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>No doubt you have been long expecting a line or two from me. I have been <hi rend="italic">very busy</hi> (rather more so than I could have wished) having been considerably thrown back through Rheumatism, but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning I cleared right off a lot of (Papers &amp;c) to Dr Hector, and now, this afternoon &amp; evening, I hope to finish reply­ing to some letters, which have been long waiting on my table.­—(I leave tomorrow for 40 mile Bush &amp; shall return about end of month, all being well. I would have gone thither last week had it not been for the holy-days, as I never travel at such times).</p>
         <p>Your letter of 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Sept I duly received, &amp; was pleased to find that you were then all well;—may this find you so,.</p>
         <p>I have just put up for you 6 Eng Papers, to be posted with this. They are rather old, &amp; would have been sent to you before, only I had lent two of the lot, and one of them only came back on Sat last—I had been personally 3 times after it. Those 2 Standards containing some good reading which I wished you to see.­—</p>
         <p>I sent you a “D.T.”—containing a condensed Report of our last meeting (on 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst.)—pretty correct as far as it goes. We are to have one more meeting in November, and if you should obtain any Spiders, Insects, &amp;c. by 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> or 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Nov, send them on.</p>
         <p>One of my objects in going to Bush now, is to get some of the smaller wee Crypts in flower or fruit,—such flower in winter or early spring—I aught to have gone thither earlier. I shall not be able to visit your place this trip of mine—I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> next time.</p>
         <p>I suppose you took a run to the Show, &amp;c, last week, I did not go—<hi rend="italic">being far too busy.</hi> I should like to have seen the flowers &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I expect to be at P. Gows on my return, next week (say from Tuesday afternoon to Friday mg, should the weather prove fine in Bush,) so that if you should happen to know of any <hi rend="italic">good</hi> chance that way, to send me anything, you could do so. And with kind regards and best wishes, <hi rend="italic">namesake</hi> &amp; all—</p>
         <p>Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>W.Colenso</p>
