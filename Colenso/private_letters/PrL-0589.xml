         <p rend="end">NORSEWOOD Jany 22/85</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Two days back I received your kind note of the 10th inst., (postmarked however “Napier 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>”), also the little packet containing the <hi rend="italic">Corysanthes</hi>, and I thank you for both. I may say I was <hi rend="italic">doubly </hi>pleased to see your well-known hand-writing, for, in addition to the letter being <hi rend="italic">from you</hi>, it had only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stamp, the <hi rend="italic">only </hi>letter or paper so ornamented (out of a big lot) since my arrival.</p>
         <p>Mr Grubb and myself have before now had some talk over it, but he says “it is the law (or rule)”, so I give in—unwillingly; all my Eng. letters—also those from Wgn &amp; the S, &amp;c., &amp;c.—(some big fellows) pay the <hi rend="italic">extra </hi>postage, which on the <hi rend="italic">big</hi>’ns comes heavy!. What a world of words about nothing!.</p>
         <p>But to your letter;—I was glad I had gone for a <hi rend="italic">long </hi>trot that day (I left lodgings before 9, &amp; returned, <hi rend="italic">tired </hi>at 2pm)—and on the further side of a river, in a dark shady low wood under a cliff, I came on your big leaved Moss, <hi rend="italic">very fine </hi>indeed, &amp; <hi rend="italic">on wood</hi>; there I had never before seen it—but alas, <hi rend="italic">barren</hi>. I have found spns of the Orchid I have long been seeking, but unfortunately, just <hi rend="italic">past </hi>flower. One spn however had 3 fls on top <hi rend="italic">open—good</hi>; it is the <hi rend="italic">Gastrodia</hi>—I have mentioned near the end of the “Ruahine” book—<hi rend="italic">not </hi>the Appendix.</p>
         <p>I am preparing to write to England, <hi rend="italic">hence</hi>, I remain up here all Jan, return­ing on about 3rd Feb.—I am well; but I daily <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> I am not so strong &amp; active as I once was for knocking about in the unbroken Bush;—.</p>
         <p>I was glad to find you were all right again, &amp; able to get out to your duty; Lumbago is an ugly customer, &amp; often stays longer than he is wanted. The <hi rend="italic">Corysanthes</hi>, is (I think) the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> spns as those larger ones you sent me; they not only vary much, in length of flower stalk,but <hi rend="italic">all elongated after</hi> flowering; (see <hi rend="italic">C. hypogæa</hi> of mine, in yr “N.Z. Inst”, where, I think, this fact is mentioned). I trust you may find the short leaved Orchid. <hi rend="italic">Drosera binata</hi> is a ticklish customer; imitate its natural habitat as closely as possible,with regard to shelter <hi rend="italic">&amp; water</hi>—and (as a rule) never remove a plant while in flower for planting. I hope your little <hi rend="italic">Mentha</hi> will succeed; send me a few flowering bits, bye &amp; bye. I have found it here in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> spot—three times following (viz three visits), &amp; have just dried a little. I was pleased to find you were able to visit the “Rio”. I did not go on board, I think the Dolbel clan should be “Proud” of their ship; I sincerely hope she may ever be “in lick” (as the sailors say) &amp; prove a good thing for them.­</p>
         <p>I came hither on the 9th, (in rain, of course;) but generally very fine weather, though gloomy looking at times. <hi rend="italic">Yesterday</hi> was a gloriously fine day; &amp; this evening was delightful,—not a cloud at sunset; I walked about outside till VIII, enjoying the lovely aspect of Nature. I have found it very hot, at times, &amp; have almost daily walked &amp;c &amp;c miles in the Bush, &amp; on the roads. I have some scores of spns (mostly small <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ</hi> &amp; Mosses,) among them some fine <hi rend="italic">Astelias</hi>, now beautifully in flower though difficult to get at. I was made to think strongly of you last week.</p>
         <p>With kind regards, Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
