         <p>Sirs and Brethren</p>
         <p>Two years have rolled by since I last wrote you: and yet I am spared and permitted to write you again.—And what shall <hi rend="italic">I </hi>say? Oh! let me, as it is my bounden duty, commence with a song of asumption and thanksgiving:—</p>
         <p>“Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto the Lamb for ever and ever: He hath put down the mighty and exalted them of low degree!—The Scriptures of the New Covenant are<hi rend="italic"> </hi>printed, and ere this reach you will (D.V.) be in circulation! Through the blessing of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> on your unworthy servant, the Testament was finished printing in December 1837, and I was enabled to get a few bound up for my Brethren, so as to present them on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. Jany. 1838, forming, as you may suppose, a most acceptable New Year’s gift. May <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> bless His word! and may many New Zealanders prove it to be, what it is, indeed, the word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>! able to make them wise unto Salvation!</p>
         <p>Trials great and many occurred during the progress of this Book through the press: Satan, evidently, fought against the publication of it, but once more are we called on to set to, our seals that God <hi rend="italic">is </hi>true, and to say with the Psalmist—Though “many are the afflictions of the righteous, yet <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> delivereth him out of them all”! 5000 copies have been struck off, and I am now engaged in binding some for the Natives, but am getting on but slowly, from having no assistant, and from having, necessarily having, a multitude of other things to attend to. I have only 6 copies by me bound, the which I send you, and hope to forward you a few more by next opportunity. I hope you will be pleased, on the whole, with the Books; I trust you will when you take all the disadvantages, under which we labor, into consideration.</p>
         <p>The Prayer Book has been revised and corrected, and is likely to be given into my hands for press, when I am prepared to receive it, that will be, I trust, in about a month or 6 weeks. For Prayer Books and Hymns there is a very great demand. A Grammar, English and New Zealand, has been commenced, and the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. halfsheet (Demy 12mo.) is now ready for press:—this also, I hope, will soon be struck off.—</p>
         <p>Our Committee were pleased, in their last meeting, to fix the Press at this station: I trust the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> directed them in their decision. Their reasons for so doing are, doubtless, transmitted to you by this opportunity.—</p>
         <p>The Revd. W. Williams having been appointed by the Northern Missionary Committee, to visit the East Cape and neighbourhood, I accompanied him, for two reasons:—1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>., as an assistant, to which I was, also, deputed by the Committee, and 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>., for relaxation; my required and constant attention to the duties of the Press having necessarily and greatly confined me within the precincts of our Station. We sailed from this place on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. Jany., 1838, and, (having in our way called at Tauranga, where we spent a few days,) <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>we on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. landed at Warekahika, (“Hick’s Bay in Map.)—we journeyed on, under the Cliffs on the Sea Coast, until the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., when we reached Turanga, (Poverty Bay) and on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. went on board our vessel, which had come to that place to meet us as appointed, and returned:—we landed at Paihia on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of February, much gratified with our visit.</p>
         <p>The Districts which we passed through—and the adjacent parts—are thickly peopled: the villages are large, some containing 1, and 2,000 souls:—the people, (in some places most particularly) heard the Word of God with attention and eagerness—a proof of which we had in their continual enquiries—their eagerness to obtain Books, (which, alas! they could not read,) and their pressing entreaties for Teachers to instruct them. In some places—though a Missionaries’ foot had never trod their soil before, nor had they ever beheld a Missionaries’ face—they do not work on the Sabbath, and as a further proof of their willingness to receive the “new word”, in one place they had been keeping 2 days in a week as a Sabbath, instead of one, being taught to do so by a Native who had at one time been in the employ of the Mission,, at the Northward. The head chiefs committed their sons to our care for Instruction, which by the blessing of God we hope to be enabled. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> is an immense field of labor awaiting the self-denying faithful servant of Jesus—I say <hi rend="italic">self-denying and faithful</hi>: for such especially must he be who enters on this extensive cure, in order to be free from blood-guiltiness. <hi rend="italic">Here </hi>is, also, a field white unto harvest; the people are ready, in some places, to cast away their superstitions, and to listen to that which is able to guide their feet into the way of peace. And, as they are living in peace, and are related in a greater or lesser degree one with another—either by consanguinity or interest—their neighbours would, perhaps, be soon brought, seeing the example of those around about them, to seek for a refuge from the wrath to come.—I shouldhave written more particularly and largely on this subject, but I suppose that the Revd. W. Williams will send you his Journal:—it not being expected, I believe, for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to keep a journal, consequently have I none to forward.—</p>
         <p>I have received a little canvas for binding the Testaments for the Natives; but the quantity is so very small; it will only serve for 3 or 4 copies: if there has been none in addition sent since, please send us sufficient for, at least, the 5000 Copies.—</p>
         <p>And now, Fathers in the Christian race! Brethren in the common cause! allow me to address you, and through you the Committee on a subject which has for a long time been <hi rend="italic">near </hi>indeed to my heart.</p>
         <p>When you communicated with me in England, I engaged with you to leave the land of my fathers as a Printer, and, at that time, I had no other thought, no other wish,—(though it must be confessed, that <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I was in the Country, I was often led to think that I should one day become  an ambassador for Christ, how or when, I know not; this was an idea which I had ever had, even from my childhood,) I arrived in this land, and on my landing, much to my surprise, and much<hi rend="italic">then</hi> against my will, was I required to assist in th English Services on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s-day.</hi>
            <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> blessed me in this work; I soon had a share in the Native Services assigned me, and, 6 months after I landed, I was enabled (oh! The goodness of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>!) to speak extemporaneously to the Natives in their own tongue:—from that time to the present have I had a full share, not only in all the spiritual duties of this Station, but, also, in visiting the institutions, in examining candidates, &amp;c, &amp;c,—I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> feel, that I cannot attend to all—that I cannot attend to both. My mirror shews me the shadow of an attenuated countenance, produced from over-exertion, for from before sunrise until 10, 11, and 12 at Night am I continually engaged. I feel that in endeavoring to serve both the Press and the Pulpit, I, in a sense of the word, miss both: my discourses from want of reflection and from fatigue are not exactly what they should be; though I know—and here I would give <hi rend="italic">all </hi>glory to <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>—that I am for this often most indescribably strengthened; and from want of necessary rest I feel often when working that at this rate my days will soon be numbered:—<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi>-days, for instance, I have often to go upward of 30 miles, (20 in a boat and 10 on foot through the “bush”,) preach 3, 4 &amp; 5 times, visit sick, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>I wish, Brethren, to lay my days out to my Redeemer’s glory who hath loved <hi rend="italic">me </hi>and given himself <hi rend="italic">for me</hi>! I wish to spend and be spent in His Service, and now the question is, How can I do it most effectively? It is this which I wish to bring before you, for your most serious consideration—I write this after much prayer—after much thought—after 3 years experience in the work;—and am forced to believe that my path is plain for me to go forth amongst the Heathen, as an Herald of the . A few reasons I here subjoin:—</p>
         <p>1. I believe, as in the presence of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">He</hi> has called me to <hi rend="italic">this </hi>work.</p>
         <p>2. He has given me, in a particular manner, the Native Language.</p>
         <p>3. He has given me favor in their sight.</p>
         <p>4. He has given me a love for preaching, with all its attendant hardships, in this land not few or small; for Travelling; and for the Natives.</p>
         <p>5. He has given me a constitution naturally good, fitted perhaps to “rough” the hardships of the wilderness; and an adaptation, as it were, for being much amongst this people.</p>
         <p>6. He has taken all fear away from me in regard of what the Natives may or can do.—</p>
         <p>I have long been of opinion that one reason why our Mission does not flourish more is, from want of an every-day knowledge of the people: an hour or two on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi>-day is not sufficient to see them; we ought to be daily moving amongst them. This is now the opinion of many of my Brethren, but, who is to go? is the question. Most of the Missionaries have large Families, and this with the secular affairs of their Stations, keep them at home—and of those who have not, some are, from a delicate state of <hi rend="italic">health</hi>, from want of adaptation to the Natives, or from want of <hi rend="italic">that </hi>knowledge of the language, &amp;c, kept at home. This, combined with the reasons aforementioned and the <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi> that the Heathen are crying for Instructors, and that there is no-one to go amongst them, constrain me to offer myself to go forth as a <hi rend="italic">Travelling Missionary</hi>.</p>
         <p>How is this to be effected? I wish you, my Brethren, to send <hi rend="italic">me</hi> out an assistant Printer, as soon as possible; if married and young the better. By that time I shall have had 2 years more experience in the Land. I <hi rend="italic">then</hi> wish to go forth on trial for 12 months, and then, (providing that this meets your approval, and that of the Committee here,) to return to England, to see my parents and family whom I affectionately <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>remember, <hi rend="italic">once </hi>more, and disentangled, in order that I may war a good warfare and serve Him faithfully who hath called me to be a soldier—to offer myself as a Candidate for Holy Orders, and thus go forth, in the strength of my blessed Jesus, against the armies of the aliens.</p>
         <p>Why wish to enter Holy Orders? why, my Brethren;—Not, <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> knows, for an earthly consideration—but, 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>.,—That I may be grounded &amp; strengthened in the lawfulness of my calling—and that I may <hi rend="italic">know</hi> from an outward as well as an inwardvcall that I am <hi rend="italic">sent</hi>:— 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>.,—That I may become the spiritual guide of all <hi rend="italic">that </hi>flock which the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> shall permit me to collect together:—and, 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>.,—That I may, as a Travelling Missionary,—having to visit places where no other will for some time perhaps be able to follow,—be allowed the unspeakable privilege of baptizing those whom the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> shall give me.—</p>
         <p>Let it not, Fathers and Brethren, be objected to me—that I <hi rend="italic">am </hi>a <hi rend="italic">printer. </hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> who called his prophets from the plough, and from among the herdmen of Tekoa, and his Apostles from the Fishery, may surely send a Herald from the Press?</p>
         <p>More, at present, on this subject I will not say:—If it is of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>, He <hi rend="italic">will </hi>dispose you to convert—open the way for me—and prepare me for this important work. If it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>; may He, of His infinite mercy, bring it to nought.</p>
         <p>I have not made my intentions public, as yet, to my brethren here. I merely write you <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, Fathers and Brethren, that you may be enabled to weigh and consider the matter, and, perhaps, kindly to let me know your opinion, that I may be guided thereby in taking any further steps in this affair.</p>
         <p>Many thanks are due from me to dear Mr. Jowett, for his kind and affectionate Letters: I have 4 now lying before me, the last bearing date June 30/37. May his Master bless him, and fulfill him daily with the benediction of His Heavenly Grace.—</p>
         <p>Oh, <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> for us! pray for <hi rend="italic">us</hi>! If ever your Mission in this land wanted prayer, it does <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. The coldness within!—the darkness without! Zion <hi rend="italic">is</hi> languishing! Satan <hi rend="italic">is</hi> triumphing! Hell is populating! and your Servants are—through the mercies of their Guide—enabled to say— “Faint; yet <hi rend="italic">still</hi> pursuing”.—</p>
         <p>May the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> be with you! Praying that we may all <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> that blessed promise— “the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> shall guide thee continually.”</p>
         <p>I remain,</p>
         <p>Fathers and Brethren,</p>
         <p>yours most truly</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p>Please transmit to my Father the sum of Twenty six pounds, £26, stg: and charge the same to the a/c of</p>
         <p>                               Willm. Colenso.</p>
