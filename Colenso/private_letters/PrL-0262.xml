         <p>Hon. D. McLean,</p>
         <p>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have been thinking over our Conversation of Monday last about the Lexicon, and as I do not see that I can do anything more than I have already often mentioned—<hi rend="italic">to continue to go on with it, to the best of my ability</hi>,—as I have always done (save when hindered by infirmity,) I write you these few lines to inform you of it. <hi rend="italic">My wish is to finish it, and that as quickly as possible</hi>, this (D.V.) I shall strive hard to do. Having however only one room in this house with a grate (my parlour), I could not well have a copying clerk here at work during the Winter, as this House is a very cold one (not being Papered), but I hope to be able to engage one when the warm weather comes round again.</p>
         <p>As you are busy, and your time for leaving us drawing near, and as I only crawl down to Town (in pain) for the Council, I won’t trouble you again with calling, unless you may wish to see me. I therefore write you this.</p>
         <p>When convenient please send me the chq. ₤5. <hi rend="italic">re </hi>J. Curling.</p>
         <p>     I am</p>
         <p>             My dear Sir</p>
         <p>             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
