         <p>Dear Sir George Grey</p>
         <p>I fear you are much too busy at present with political matters for me to trespass on you with a short note: nevertheless I will attempt it.—</p>
         <p>My object is to bring to your notice the enclosed Circular (written for our members), and remembering your kind and valued approval of my Ruahine (“In Memoriam”) tract, a few years ago, to ask you, to become a Subscriber: the Ms. is now in the printer’s hands.</p>
         <p>And as my “Presidential Address” has this day been printed here (by request), I send you a copy with this, which please, do me the honour of accepting. I hope you may find time to look into it,—particularly at pages 27, 28, &amp; 29.</p>
         <p>I may also mention, that while in the woods (at Dannevirke) in February last, I wrote a short note to you, (mainly to give you a kind message from our mutual friend Sir. J.D. Hooker,)—but I never heard of its having reached you,—perhaps it was missed.—</p>
         <p>I hope you are keeping well and strong: and with very kind regards, I am,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir George Grey,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
