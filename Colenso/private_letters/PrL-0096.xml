         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your kind note &amp; accompaniments have just reached me.—I thank you much for all—but can scarcely reply to your note just now. I was yesterday aftn. siezed with a violent headache, which, spite of medicine, still continues, so that I scarcely know what I am doing.—</p>
         <p>We send you some milk &amp; apples—the 4 or 5 <hi rend="italic">red </hi>ones are fathered, &amp; may be nearly ripe, being summer fruit.</p>
         <p>We regret, however, that you should have deprived yourself of the ale—as it is of great service to you, whether at Ahuriri (without good water), or travelling: if I thought you would not be offended at my doing so—I would return it to you by your Natives.</p>
         <p>I hope to write you again in a day or two—when I will return your paper &amp; Mr. Morgan’s letter.—</p>
         <p>And I also hope to send 3 or 4 packages to Ahuriri on Tuesday next for Wellington per Rose.</p>
         <p>       Excuse this my dear Sir</p>
         <p>               &amp; Believe me</p>
         <p>                       Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>                               W. Colenso</p>
