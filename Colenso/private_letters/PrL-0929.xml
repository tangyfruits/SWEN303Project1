         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>March 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1895.</p>
         <p>Dear Dr. Hocken,</p>
         <p>“Eureka”! I gladly exclaimed this morning, on receiving &amp; reading your doubly kind epistle &amp; gift: indeed, I hardly know how to thank you for <hi rend="italic">both</hi>—the letter itself being so full of <hi rend="italic">ready </hi>kindness. I will reply at once, to show my earnest desire to aid you: and I will take up your sentences <hi rend="italic">seriatim.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>With you—I can truly &amp; feelingly say,—I look back with pleasure on the few hours we spent together here,—“hoping” (as you say) “that another year may see it renewed.” Thanks for your kind remembrance of me &amp; my <hi rend="italic">old work</hi>, when dining at Wellington, <hi rend="italic">en route</hi>, with Sir Robert Stout: I hope , <hi rend="italic">also</hi>, to see him in office again.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>your enquiry— “Where is to be found any account of the translation and issue of the Scriptures?” I should say; (1.) In the monthly publications of the C.M.S. of <hi rend="italic">those years </hi>(possibly I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> possess <hi rend="italic">some </hi>of them—saved from the great fire—among my heterogeneous masses of old papers), (2.) See Brett’s “Early History of N.Z.” p.419. (3.) Yates “N.Z.” pp.182, 230, 232. (4.) Marshall’s “N.Z.” pp.25, 26, 46, 47. (5.) “Memoir of R. Davies,” pp.226, 232. (6.) Taylor’s “Ika-a-Maui,” (quoted by me in letter VI, against Rom. Ch.) (7.) In my “50 years in N.Z.”——–</p>
         <p>I have, also, the <hi rend="italic">original </hi>Printing Office Account Books, and could give you all special information <hi rend="italic">re </hi>printing—dates &amp; issues of every work from them.—</p>
         <p>I should like to know, what books you may have collected printed by me at C.M. Press, <hi rend="italic">Paihia</hi>, 1835–1843.—</p>
         <p>I have unearthed copies of 2–3 of the <hi rend="italic">earlier </hi>ones. Have you got a copy of “Ephesians &amp; Phillips.”, and of “Luke”?—let me know.</p>
         <p>I have also copies of the Pentateuch &amp; Joshua, 12mo., reprinted, London, 1848.</p>
         <p>But give me a <hi rend="italic">List </hi>of what you have already acquired.</p>
         <p>What can I say to your kind &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">thoughtful</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> gift</hi> of specs.? (&amp; I am <hi rend="italic">ashamed</hi>—<hi rend="italic">until</hi> I make some kind of, or attempt at, return.) I have tried them, with great pleasure; they seem to fit me capitally. Curiously enough, only last Friday (8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.), when down in town, I brought away with me from Cooper’s shop 6 pairs of “smoked” specs. on trial, 5 of them having <hi rend="italic">side </hi>glasses,—but all are <hi rend="italic">too dark</hi>, and I was about to return them when your boon arrived!—</p>
         <p>And then, <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">not </hi>least, your kind, aye loving &amp; <hi rend="italic">valued </hi>Invitation. Heigh ho! I am overwhelmed: I hope yet to do something in return.—</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Dear Dr. Hocken,</p>
         <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I returned to N. from Dannevirke on Tuesday last (5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst.) &amp; purpose going thither again (for Ch.<hi rend="italic">service</hi>) about 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>.—W.C.</p>
