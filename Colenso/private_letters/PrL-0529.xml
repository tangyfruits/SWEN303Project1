         <p rend="end">Napier Sunday night <lb/>March 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1883</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>It is quite time I should answer your kind letter of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, which, believe me, I have been always going to do; but I first wished to examine what you had sent me, in it &amp; with it, (for which <hi rend="italic">thanks</hi>), &amp; 2ndly, I have been greatly hindered—busy with <hi rend="italic">unexpected</hi> matters;—as, the week before the last, <hi rend="italic">3 days</hi> at Omahu at Renatas “King” meeting; &amp; last week, Monday &amp; Tuesday in the “Compensation Court” held here, &amp; in the bother of objections &amp; appeals against the stupid (and overrated) doings of property tax valuators; &amp; then the writing to Eng by mail, which closed yesterday. I had vainly hoped &amp; looked forward to having much spare time for my little studies, &amp;c, &amp;c, during the past month (after “Report” had been got out,) and this; but NO; always something to hinder me; how my time flies by &amp; nothing <hi rend="italic">done</hi>; &amp; yet I enjoy good health keep no company, and am <hi rend="italic">never idle</hi>.</p>
         <p>Now to your letter; 1. I have little doubt of your <hi rend="italic">Divott Plant</hi>, with <hi rend="italic">long</hi> leaves, being distinct from the former one, but we must wait for <hi rend="italic">flowers</hi>—to decide it. 2. The little <hi rend="italic">Fungus</hi> on dead stick, has pleased me much; I think it is a spn of <hi rend="italic">Geoglossom</hi> (a large cosmopolite Genus), but it will require careful microscopical exam &amp; dissection, &amp;c. I found a <hi rend="italic">large</hi> species once or twice (look it out in your Hand Book)­—send me, at leisure, more of this. 3. Moth. Pity it was broken; but I will know something more of this ere long. (In putting up a moth, or <hi rend="italic">any insect</hi>, do not put it into wool or cotton <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>, place a bit of fine soft old rag, or very thin <hi rend="italic">rubbed</hi> worn paper, between it &amp; the wool,—for horns, &amp; legs, get entangled; &amp; there is a breakage; &amp; lots of temper!! &amp; of time!!! and an effusion of words—<hi rend="italic">not</hi> poetical.) 4. Your precious box. Ah; this I shall hope to receive &amp; unpack &amp; re­joice over. If your glass bottle of flies, &amp;c, is <hi rend="italic">in it</hi>, among the stones, I hope it is <hi rend="italic">very well</hi> secured.</p>
         <p>I purpose going inland on Friday next, 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &amp; suppose I shall be absent nearly a month,—better perhaps keep it till I return.</p>
         <p>I shall have to attend the Appeal Court at Waipawa <hi rend="italic">next</hi> week, &amp; that will sadly hinder me again.</p>
         <p>I saw <hi rend="italic">young</hi> P.D. in town yesterday, he told me his uncle P had gone to <hi rend="italic">Patea</hi>; I fancied, it might be <hi rend="italic">Glenross.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Winklemann had lately returned from Barrier Island (Frith of Thames), and has got a rare lot of things for me—for us; like you, he has writ­ten to me of his <hi rend="italic">case</hi>, ready; I have had by post a few wee plants &amp;c from him.</p>
         <p>Should you <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to write to me—up to say 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> April, direct to Waipuku­rau; after that &amp; <hi rend="italic">on to 20</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>, to Matamau; more I cannot say.</p>
         <p>With kind regards &amp; best wishes, Believe me,</p>
         <p>             Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>                             Wm Colenso</p>
         <p>16/4/83 Too busy to write. Note received. Get more of your fine “Fungus for future exams; put it, leaf &amp; all, while still a little damp, in a pa­per, flat, in a thin, <hi rend="italic">not heavy</hi>, book to dry, W.C.</p>
