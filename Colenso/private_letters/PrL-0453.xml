         <p rend="end">Napier June 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1881</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>last night my dear old friend P. Dolbel turned up, most unexpectedly; and we had nearly 2 hours of good “chat”—until broken in upon. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> were mentioned, also the last lot of plants (Orchis living,) I received from you­—though I did not know until P.D. told me, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had been to town, &amp; also brought them. I thank you for them, and as I have managed to secure them pretty well &amp; naturally to a tree, I hope they may flower.</p>
         <p>Among my lot of un-answered letters I find one from you, dated “9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> May”(!!!) and I do fear I have not written to you since that date; for I had only re­turned from the country a few days before, &amp; was <hi rend="italic">there</hi> seriously ill—but was sadly <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to take “the duty” on the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of May,—though far from well. I only recovered very slowly, and that, perhaps, owing to the continuous fine weather of May.</p>
         <p>Although I have not written, I have sent you a paper or two to let <hi rend="italic">you know you were not forgotten,</hi> and also your copy of Vol.XIII “Trans. N.Z.I.” which I hope you duly received <hi rend="italic">all right</hi>.</p>
         <p>Last Tuesday the second half of those copies for our members arrived, and I have been busy in sending out copies to those who have <hi rend="italic">paid</hi>, and in writing (alas too many!!) notes to <hi rend="italic">the others</hi>, who have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> paid; this is a sad waste of time (to me).</p>
         <p>I hope you are well, also Mrs Balfour and all the <hi rend="italic">Bairnies</hi> (Is that a <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> Scotch word?) Dinna forget, when ye come to toun, to call. I want to show you some of my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> lots—exhibited at last meeting,—collected by J. Stewart and myself—(Corals &amp; Bryozoa) another <hi rend="italic">line</hi> altogether from botany—but one in which, I think, you too may render <hi rend="italic">good</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">help</hi> when once put into the way. I am tired writing (tho <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to you) and with kind regards</p>
         <p>             I am</p>
         <p>                             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
