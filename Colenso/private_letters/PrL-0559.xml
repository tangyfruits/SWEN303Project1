         <p rend="end">Napier March 12/84 night</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Last night I received your kind letter of the 9th, and with it, no less than 3 small parcels; and when my man returned from P.O. (which he regularly does at VIII pm) &amp; placed them on the table,—I, seeing at a glance, who they were from, anticipated a feast.</p>
         <p>When I last wrote to you, I did not expect to hear from you in reply before <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> night; and then I feared I should not be able to write again to you before I left for the Bush; but now, through your prompt kindness, I am able to do so;—and I hope to tell you all (or nearly so) about your plant.</p>
         <p>First, then, it is an Orchid. 2nd of the genus Pterostylis;—3rd it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> turn out to be a new spn, <hi rend="italic">Pt emarginata</hi>, (Trans. N.Z. Inst, Vol. XV. P.328) but scarcely I think it is, from what little remains of the withered plant sent, or, it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> turn out to be <hi rend="italic">Pt Banksii</hi>, (Handbook, P.268,) but this must remain in doubt until we see its <hi rend="italic">flower</hi>—next early summer, or say Xmas, that is its flowering season,—or, it <hi rend="italic">may </hi>prove to be a new species. I found one—a beautiful specimen; in flower &amp; perfection on 20th Dec in the Bush, on a hill top, where, in all my years <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, I had never seen one before. Pt Banksii was very common at the North, &amp; so some other species; they are sometimes met with, a lot together!!!. Harvey found several at Hampden, and so did Winkleman at Te Aute. W. sent me a lot of good fine specimens, but in his packing, <hi rend="italic">crushed</hi> the flowers (and saved the <hi rend="italic">roots</hi>. One of the <hi rend="italic">roots</hi> I put into a pot, and it flowered very well here this summer). I have been making another coloured drawing of <hi rend="italic">another</hi> spn (there are several, both in N.Z. &amp; Australia), and they have all, <hi rend="italic">in the flower</hi>, a great <hi rend="italic">family</hi> likeness; but <hi rend="italic">Pt emarginata</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Pt. Banksii</hi>, are very much larger than this drawing, &amp; with <hi rend="italic">longer &amp; finer</hi> red tails. I have planted the 2 little roots, in my Orchid Pot (with others), and I hope they may grow, &amp;c. Winklemanns were 3–4 times the size of yours. I may add, I was led to make the drawing partly on account of your little son, who, when the season comes round again, with his sharp eyes, and keen scent (or <hi rend="italic">desire</hi>),will be sure to detect, &amp; recognise it.<note xml:id="ftn3-232" place="foot" n="232"> Colenso’s watercolour, in the collections of MTG Hawke’s Bay, depicts <hi rend="italic">Pterostylis trullifolia</hi>.</note>
         </p>
         <p>The remnant of the elegant little fragile moth, was just sufficient to allow of its recognition. It is a marvellous creature; so finely formed, and a winged creature too, &amp; a night flyer. One would almost suppose, that it must perish during its first 5 minutes flight.—But species, or genera, like it, are also found in several parts of the globe.</p>
         <p>I have been busy of late, <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">preparing</hi> to commence my long delayed &amp; heavy job of <hi rend="italic">Mosses</hi>, and as the winter sets in, I shall look to you for supplies. I had rather a tough job last week in a spn of <hi rend="italic">Olearia</hi>, (a pretty &amp; rather curious shrub) I received from Woodville; the first of it came 10–12 months ago, but only leaves;—last month some flowering spn, but these were smashed up, partly by <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> packing, partly by the carriage, &amp;c. so I had to seek more, which were very kindly &amp; promptly sent, and now I have another new spn of <hi rend="italic">Olearia</hi>. This genus, (i.e. any one almost of its many species) requires careful dissection &amp; examination. We have several—perhaps nearly 30,—and Australia has 63 species, &amp; through them all I have had to run. I have also another new spn, which Hill found on Ruahine slopes in January.—I hope to leave on Sat morning for Bush, returning by (say) 2nd April. I do not expect much at this season, I go for change &amp; health.</p>
         <p>I have been expecting all last week to have seen here, my old friend P.D. I hope he is <hi rend="italic">keeping well</hi>.</p>
         <p>I have not heard a sound since my last, respecting our unfortunate Scty. I wrote a note to Dr Sp., the <hi rend="italic">V.P.</hi>, on Monday last, fixing tomorrow morning for calling on him (as the V.P), to see what has been (?) or may yet be done for its good.</p>
         <p>And now I must close. I was much pleased to find you were all so very well. May this find you all still enjoying that <hi rend="italic">great</hi> blessing. We, also enjoyed with you that delightful rain, which we had greatly needed here on the hills.</p>
         <p>With very kind regards</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>I think I told you, a long time ago, that having lost the use of my right thumb for drawing, I cannot now draw.</p>
