         <p rend="end">Waitangi, H Bay, Sept 4/50</p>
         <p>Mess D. &amp; Co.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen</p>
         <p>My last Letter to you was dated Apl 30/50, wh. with enclosures—namely, the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>of a Sett of Bills of Ex. for ₤100. &amp; the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of a Sett of Bills of Ex. for ₤74.12.6, and, an order for sundry goods—I hope you will have safely received before this can possibly reach you.—</p>
         <p>A small vessel for W. being at last! in our harbor affords me an oppory. of sending you Duplicates of the above mentioned Letter &amp; Enclosures. Together with a small additional order, and the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of a Sett of Bills upon CMS. for ₤34.11.10 (Th. f. p. el. &amp; t. p.) wh. I sincerely hope may speedily be recd.</p>
         <p>Our usual little trading vessel having unforty. foundered, some time in June month, when (I lost all, whatever that all might be of Letters goods &amp; papers, and when) all hands perished; is the reason why I have not had an oppory. for Wellington during the winter till now.—</p>
         <p>I have just received 3 Record Papers &amp; 1 Examiner dated Sept/49 from my friend Rev. R Cole—wh., I perceive fm. yr. hd. writing had been sent him by you, &amp; for which I thank you much.</p>
         <p>Since my last to you, we, in taking out the Brown paper wh. lay at the bottom of a box, found the 4 muslin Collars which had been missing.—</p>
         <p>Some of the goods you last sent me—such as Type, &amp;c—I have not yet opened, for lack of time.—</p>
         <p>I would be obliged in your ascertaining if a complete Copy of Cook’s Voyages, of the <hi rend="italic">large original Govt. edition</hi>, (of course 2<hi rend="sup">nd.</hi> hand), could be obtained; and the price. And, if under, or not above ₤3., to purchase it for me.—</p>
         <p>Please also to let us know the <hi rend="italic">price</hi> &amp; sizes of the <hi rend="italic">gutta percha tubing</hi>.—</p>
         <p>We, this morning, received a small case of useful medicines, sent from C.M.S. perhaps shipped by you?—&amp; for the timely arrival of wh. we are very thankful.</p>
         <p>I requested you in my last to send me some of my goods in outfit chests—if you have not already done so—you may send the greater part of them in good large <hi rend="italic">Casks</hi> as heretofore—as I can now dispose of some of the Casks to the Europeans engaged in salting pork for exportation.—</p>
         <p>Is the suspensn. stove a useful art., &amp; what will it burn?</p>
         <p>In consigning the goods to Wellington there is no need to particularize the contents of every package—especially such </p>
