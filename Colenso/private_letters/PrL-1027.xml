         <p rend="end">Napier, Decr. 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>./97</p>
         <p>My dear Mr Lund</p>
         <p>Your very kind letter of 29<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. is to hand, I thank you heartily for it. It contains food for thought, as well as showing the good open free disposition of the writer. You have been thinking on me: and <hi rend="italic">I of you</hi>. Indeed I had very nearly troubled you with a Xmas. card—one of flowers, or of alpine scenery, or something <hi rend="italic">truly</hi> natural—to raise an affectionate kind of thought wish, idea, good of course, even if of a troll, or of some thing far away in the good old Father-land—but then I thought my old friend <hi rend="italic">won’t </hi>care for—value, <hi rend="underline italic">that</hi>.</p>
         <p>I have sent out, I think, 40–50, or more including books to school-boys &amp; girls, and my hand &amp; arm (the poor injured one!) having been doing double duty wants rest—this <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may perceive from my hideous specimen of <hi rend="italic">calligraphy</hi>!—In town last week, I met w. Andrews, who told me of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">your </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">kind</hi> message by him, which I was glad to receive: remarking however “I feared he had forgotten me”—this from <hi rend="italic">that unfortunate</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">contretemps</hi>: A. told me you were well, and, of course, <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>, especially at <hi rend="italic">this season</hi>, though I don’t think many strangers select Makotuku for a holiday excursion, or short visit. I may mention another reason I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> for not writing to you, viz. my full intention in October to pay a visit to the Bush in Novr. <hi rend="italic">after </hi>Synod meeting here:—but I was taken unwell then (only in Synod first 3 days) and so, the weather also being <hi rend="italic">hot</hi>, I put off my journey till autumn—when I hope to visit the Bush, &amp; <hi rend="italic">once more </hi>see your honest face, hear your voice, &amp; grasp your hand—tho’ it <hi rend="italic">may </hi>be by <hi rend="italic">my left </hi>one!</p>
         <p>I know you see the “Herald”, &amp; you may have seen therein some more of my scrawl—and I am now going to be <hi rend="italic">extra busy</hi>, with new year, in that <hi rend="italic">way</hi>—though <hi rend="italic">not </hi>for Newspaper Columns.—</p>
         <p>You are rather <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> on some of the orthodox folk, but I must, in <hi rend="italic">this too</hi>, go<hi rend="italic"> with you</hi>: also, in your definition of the <hi rend="italic">true </hi>Christian. It is impossible to take up with <hi rend="italic">that </hi>train of thought and not to consider <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> of old who came out frequently on the <hi rend="italic">orthodox</hi> of his day!—it is a saddening theme.</p>
         <p>We heard of the Dean being with you (<hi rend="italic">plural</hi>): I have not seen him—nor any Churchman since <hi rend="italic">in </hi>Synod—save Mr. Welsh, who is ill, &amp; kindly calls; he is going to England in March, <hi rend="italic">seeking health</hi>.</p>
         <p>As you divine—I cannot do much w. my rt. hand &amp; arm—&amp; <hi rend="italic">don’t </hi>expect much more: <hi rend="italic">I should be thankful </hi>for what I have regained—am <hi rend="italic">cheerful</hi>, making best of things. The worst is my legs—still <hi rend="italic">weak </hi>outdoors.</p>
         <p>Ta: ta: Good Bye. The best of blessings be yours. Be cheerful. Live in hopes and sing!</p>
         <p>Yours ever</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">P.S. </hi>Have not yet walked to the old seat on the brow.</p>
