         <p rend="end">Dannevirke<lb/>Tuesday night, 11/X/92</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Yesterday I returned from Woodv. and found your <hi rend="italic">prized </hi>long letter (with several per Eng. Mail) awaiting me. To <hi rend="italic">yours </hi>I directed my attention &amp; revelled in your friendly &amp; graphic account of your Phil. Socy. Meetg. last week: thanks big &amp; many. Then the really good account of Victor! &amp; of your family!! and last (though <hi rend="italic">not </hi>least) your loving &amp; thoughtful P.S.—which I must also separately notice anon.–</p>
         <p>Since my <hi rend="italic">last </hi>to you (20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. ulto.) I have been 3 times to Woodville on duty: but first let me tell you, that <hi rend="italic">here </hi>on 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi> in wind &amp; rain I was <hi rend="italic">obliged </hi>to do duty in Cemetery—Robertshawe being absent at Synod: I had never been there before—a long walk, beyond the Schoolhouse: like a good <hi rend="italic">Israelite </hi>I kept my hat on during the whole service, though at times I feared it would be blown off &amp; into the grave! I <hi rend="italic">felt </hi>the long walk there, &amp; standing, and then back! but fortunately all between heavy showers. The last corpse I interred was Hamlin’s child at Napier some 35 years ago!!</p>
         <p>Well: to <hi rend="italic">proceed</hi>: on my reaching Woodv. on Saty. 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., I was <hi rend="italic">horrified</hi>! to find the Ch. had been <hi rend="italic">closed </hi>for 2 Sundays! and both days, too, <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I felt upset</hi>: much discontent, &amp; rightly so. In Ch. on Sy. (at mg. &amp; evg. S.) I told them—the fault was <hi rend="italic">not mine</hi>, &amp; that<hi rend="italic"> </hi>such should not occur again while I was in the Bush: most unfortunately however the weather on that day (25), &amp; on 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. inst., was most <hi rend="italic">wretched</hi>! a continual steady downpour:—<hi rend="italic">evil remarks </hi>were made! But this last Sunday (9<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>) weather was delightful, &amp; consequently large Congns. indeed the weather has been fine <hi rend="italic">all last </hi>wk. from Monday 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. inclusive down to last night, and now today rain again—but mild: this aftn. 4m. before 2, a <hi rend="italic">smart &amp; long </hi>shock of earthq., which caused me to run out into the rain <hi rend="italic">without </hi>a hat! fearing what <hi rend="italic">might </hi>follow; but no more. Next Sy. I exchange w. Eccles,—he at Wdv., &amp; I at Waipawa.—In one of my late return jys. from Wdv. your good cousin R. was a fellow-passgr. from Whanganui, I told him what I had written to you about his father at Southampton. I, too, noticed what you mention <hi rend="italic">re </hi>“<hi rend="italic">Capt. </hi>J. Hg.”, &amp; supposed it to be yr. Uncle. Did you happen to know a man named Driscoll? (formerly of Waipawa) a Barber, &amp;c. at Woodv. he was buried on Sy. aftn. a very large attendance, he being both Freemason &amp; Forester, and spoken well of: I was twice in his shop talking w. him on Monday 26<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. ult., on Tuesday (27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>) while at “Lodge” he was taken unwell, &amp; on Thursday nt. died. Mr Robertshawe being <hi rend="italic">wired </hi>for on Thursday went thither to see him.—</p>
         <p>H.B.Phil.Inst held theirs last night—Lessong’s paper on “Gravitation” &amp;c came on, also one more by Lund, on Coins: L. is a great Numismatist, and has a goodly &amp; val. colln. Taylor White’s paper<hi rend="underline italic">s</hi> (whatever they are!) did <hi rend="italic">not </hi>come on: I suppose they will at the <hi rend="italic">next </hi>Mtg. <hi rend="italic">in Nov</hi>. A letter to hand last night from Hill, dated Saty. nt. 8<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., letting me know he was off overland on Sundy. mg. &amp; should <hi rend="italic">not </hi>return for 6 weeks! so he does <hi rend="italic">not intend </hi>to be at the Novr. Mtg. although it was fixed <hi rend="italic">for him, </hi>&amp; he promised to be there w. his Paper.——</p>
         <p>I have, <hi rend="italic">at last</hi>! begun my paper on T. White’s romance of Mao. Dog, &amp; if I do not get it ready for the Novr. Mtg. at N., I shall send it to Wgn. and perhaps to you: I feel it to be <hi rend="italic">a duty</hi> devolving on me to take it up—though I would rather have saved the time for better purposes. I intend to send <hi rend="italic">you </hi>the Paper when ready for your friendly-critical eye. I want from you, a copy of “The Monthly Review,” vol. II—Feby, 1890: <hi rend="italic">or</hi>, <hi rend="italic">that paper </hi>in it <hi rend="italic">ending </hi>at p. 93, (which has, on p.94, “Te Awhiorangi” paper by Gudgeon) so kindly sent me by you: or, if neither is to be had, then <hi rend="underline italic">the date</hi> of those Mao. wars at Taranaki therein narrated, in which Barrett &amp; his “pals” were engaged.—Now if you can send me this informn. <hi rend="italic">early </hi>I shall be again greatly obliged.—I have your “Typo,” also, “Maori Hansard”: former I have read &amp; <hi rend="italic">again </hi>go w. you! I feel pleased &amp; <hi rend="italic">thankful</hi>: latter—I reserve, small type, bad paper, &amp; badly printed.——I have recd. a copy of “The Californian Illustd. Mag.,” no. for June/92—a broad 8vo contg. nearly 200pp. with <hi rend="italic">many</hi> capital illustrations, several being full-page: among the papers is a memoir of Thorwalsden, beautifully illustd. (2 of them, in the lett. press,—medallion form, “Day &amp; Night,” are <hi rend="italic">exquisite</hi>!) If you <hi rend="italic">have </hi>the work there in Wgn.—I have not yet seen it, do look at <hi rend="italic">these 2</hi>: &amp; if you have it <hi rend="italic">not </hi>then I will send you my copy.—–</p>
         <p>I was not a little surprised, early last week on recg. a very kind note from Rev. J. Hobbs of Hastings, asking me to take a share of duty in his parish during his absence in Australia (6 wks. holiday!) I was, of course. obliged to tell him I was <hi rend="italic">booked </hi>here until Eccles should remove,—and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, what about Waipawa? I have heard, that <hi rend="italic">O. Deane has </hi>been <hi rend="italic">trying </hi>for it. And so Hadfield, Wgn. is about to resign his Primacy! Well, <hi rend="italic">not too soon.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">
               <note xml:id="ftn3-619" place="foot" n="619"> Octavius Hadfield was elected primate in 1890, but retired three years later when he felt himself unequal to the responsibility. He disliked the sceptical tendencies prevalent in philosophy, science, and Biblical criticism. John Mill's system of morals he once dismissed as one of the most marvellous instances of the abuse of human ingenuity which could be produced. Darwinism he reprobated. <emph>Essays and Reviews</emph> revealed him as a fundamentalist. (http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/hadfield-octavius/1).</note>
            </hi>
         </p>
         <p>Last wk. I recd. a <hi rend="italic">very nice</hi> letter from my good Presbytn. friend—Rev. R. Stewart now settled<hi rend="italic"> </hi>at Greymouth: he &amp; his were well, &amp; doing well w. good prospects: may <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> blessing be w. him!</p>
         <p>From what you tell me, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>your own paper, I am pretty sure it is all the better for you &amp; for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> that it was not read at your last meeting. I am much interested in what you have told me <hi rend="italic">re </hi>J.B’s. “P. Progress” &amp; your own little ones—such serve to take me back to days of boyhood. That book is <hi rend="italic">still </hi>a wonderful one! Did I tell you, that I have a <hi rend="italic">first-rate </hi>Ms. transln. of <hi rend="italic">both </hi>parts into Maori? (<hi rend="italic">Not </hi>done by myself.) It is closely written on flp. folio <hi rend="italic">without </hi>margin, &amp; on <hi rend="italic">both sides</hi>, but clearly done. <hi rend="italic">Sad </hi>news this of late—the death of Tennyson! It set me a-looking into his “<hi rend="italic">In. Mem</hi>.” which I always carry w. me: ere long, I, too, <hi rend="italic">must </hi>follow—and thus writing brings me to your honest truthful kind &amp; loving P.S.—<hi rend="italic">re </hi>what I may have acquired during a long &amp; active &amp; laborious life in this land; there <hi rend="italic">are </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">lots</hi>—good bad &amp; indifft. no doubt! but it would puzzle many &amp; <hi rend="italic">you also </hi>(though <hi rend="italic">one </hi>of the <hi rend="underline italic">very best</hi>) to unravel them. In your once writing to me, of the sad broken state of J. Wh’s. papers (as seen by Tregear), I thought of <hi rend="italic">my own as being still </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">worse</hi>! Had you my dear Mr. Harding <hi rend="italic">remained at N. </hi>it was my intention to have endeavoured to obtain your assistance, <hi rend="italic">and </hi>to make you by will Literary trustee w. <hi rend="italic">full powers</hi>, &amp;c, &amp;c, but your removal to Wgn. prevents all that: at same time, <hi rend="italic">nothing </hi>has <hi rend="italic">yet </hi>been done by me, to conserve anything; neither can I bring myself to act, for I do not know a single person (beside your self) in whom I could <hi rend="underline italic">fully</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> confide</hi>.—This, however, <hi rend="underline italic">we</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> must consider again</hi>.</p>
         <p>And now w. kindest regards to you &amp; yours, believe me ever</p>
         <p>Yours faithy.</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>[Hand &amp; arm dreadfully aching.]</p>
         <p>Henn is <hi rend="italic">out </hi>of P.O. Pension £80. A subs. (£50) &amp; testiml. got up for him; a <hi rend="italic">good faithful </hi>public servant.</p>
