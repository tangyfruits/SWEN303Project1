         <p rend="end">Friday Aftn.</p>
         <p>His Honor</p>
         <p> D. McLean, Esq.</p>
         <p>     &amp;c  &amp;c  &amp;c</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Many thanks for your kind note of this morning—you are no sooner back, than you are kindly thinking of your neighbour! I had heard of your having arrived, indeed I thought I made you out with my glass yesterday—I fear you must have had a rough passage, but it was well you were <hi rend="italic">not </hi>out <hi rend="italic">last </hi>night.</p>
         <p>I thank you much for <hi rend="italic">Crusoe</hi>, and will return it to you in a few days—so that you may return it to the library: I have long had the <hi rend="italic">P. Progress</hi> (a <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> translation)—I therefore return you the copy you sent.</p>
         <p>I am indebted to you, my dear Sir, for all you have kindly done, or attempted, in way of Dictionary— “Essay”—&amp;c &amp;c. I am much gratified in finding that you had seen the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> copy, and that you approved of it: I return Hector’s note (enclosed).</p>
         <p>It was one thing, however, to have printed it as an Essay, (Hastily written—in “6 weeks,” all the time allowed me!)—and at <hi rend="italic">that time</hi> too,—and now to print it among the more carefully written “Institute” Papers:—but better perhaps thus, than not at all: Sir G. Grey greatly wished for a copy.—</p>
         <p>I know nothing of what you may have been doing at Wellington during the last fortnight—(indeed I know little of what is doing <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, as I have not been in the town for more than a week)—as my papers thence have been very irregular, so, also, from Auckland.</p>
         <p>I hope to do myself the pleasure of calling on you at your office in a few days—perhaps on Monday or Tuesday;—I hope you are quite well, and that you will continue so, as I am sure you will have “lots of calls”—at the same time you will <hi rend="italic">need</hi> rest—after all your battlings, late sittings, and mental worry,—and if you do not secure it, you will find you are burning <hi rend="italic">both ends</hi> of the candle.</p>
         <p>I am truly glad you are returned to us.</p>
         <p>     I am</p>
         <p>             My dear Sir</p>
         <p>     Yourstruly</p>
         <p>             Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I got a letter from Latimer last evening—he arrived in London Augt. 12—105 days passage,—of which, 48 (!) from Auckland to C. Horn.—</p>
