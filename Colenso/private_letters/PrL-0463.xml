         <p rend="end">Napier, Septr. 9, 1881.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Some 10–12 days back I received your kind note of 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. ulto., and would have replied at once and have sent you the few papers we have had read (as you requested), but I have been waiting for Dr. Spencer’s microscopl. Drawings of some <hi rend="italic">Desmids</hi>., to accompany his paper <hi rend="italic">according to his wish</hi>; and now I find that they are not yet finished, and I have just told him that I shall send the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> read Papers to you tomorrow;—as these are “Miscellaneous,”—and his “Botanical,” (which class comes in <hi rend="italic">later</hi>): he wishes his Drawings to accompany his Paper.—</p>
         <p>I fancy you will be a little surprised at the contents of my present bizarre lot. The Charms, Invocations, &amp;c. are (as far as I know) <hi rend="italic">wholly new</hi> in an English dress: and being handed down in almost an obsolete state (as I have therein shown) they are exceedingly difficult to translate. I may truly say, that to do so, has taken me some <hi rend="italic">weeks </hi>“off-and-on.”—These 3 papers have been a real <hi rend="italic">labour</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I hope to have one more “Miscellaneous” paper, (“On the old Maori fine perception of colours,”) which is now in hand, (and would have been finished but for my Rheumatism,) to be read next month: also, one short Botanical paper, and one (or two) very short Zoological ones.—I suppose the omitted Zool. paper I sent you <hi rend="italic">very late </hi>last year, will be pubd. in this vol. I find the Insects therein described, are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in Broun, nor Hutton.</p>
         <p>There is still one item (<hi rend="italic">i.e. </hi>the true rendering of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> word) wanting in my paper (now sent) on the <hi rend="italic">Kumara</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ideal</hi>), p.19, Ms.—and I have written N. &amp; S. about it,—to the Bay of Islands, Thames, E. Coast, &amp; W. Coast, (besides having made a heap of enquiries here extending over months!)—and if I receive the reply I am in quest of, I will send it to you for insertion: I have taken extra trouble in this matter, as I wish to be exact,—and I think I shall succeed.—Locke had promised to make enquiry for me when lately at Wgn. (twice), but he, too, was unsuccessful,—and, I fear, was too busy.—</p>
         <p>I trust there will not be such a sad amount of “printer’s errors” <hi rend="italic">in my contributions</hi> this time, as there was in those in vol. XIII: in the sheets you kindly sent me to look over for errata, at only once reading I found over 40, and since then I have found several more. Considering the very great clearness of all my Ms. <hi rend="italic">for press</hi>, I very much fear, that the old plan at home is carried out here, viz. to put the clearest written Ms. into the boys’ or worst workmen’s hands,—hence the great no. of errors; still the <hi rend="italic">reader</hi> should have done better. I wish I had the privilege of reading the proof sheets.—</p>
         <p>I have to thank you for the Cast of the Bell kindly presented by you to the Museum. I trust you did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> find in my letter to you, that I had for a moment intimated or supposed that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were in the very least responsible for the damage done to the few exhibits? Nothing was further from my mind; and so, I thought, I had expressed myself. I told Grant (Dunedin) so, <hi rend="italic">plainly </hi>and truly: I have had no reply from him to my letter.—</p>
         <p>I am sorry to say, that we shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have any Meeting on Monday night, next!—<hi rend="italic">nothing ready</hi> (I having been laid up with Rheumatism); but we shall have an extra Meeting in Novr., to make up for it.</p>
         <p>I hope this may find you <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> well. I received from Mr. Gore the receipts, &amp;c. I thank you for the offer of vols. XIII. if required.</p>
         <p>Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
