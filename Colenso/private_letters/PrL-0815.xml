         <p rend="end">Dannevirke<lb/>Sunday aftn., Jany. 31<lb/>1892.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>I hope I may not disturb your equanimity nor hinder your busy working in writing you a few more lines: probably my <hi rend="italic">last </hi>to you <hi rend="italic">at </hi>Napier!—</p>
         <p>Your kind &amp; welcome letter of 29<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. I duly recd. &amp; thank you for it, &amp; for the <hi rend="italic">good </hi>tidings it contained, (1) <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Victor: and (2) Your getting on so bravely with your work—but you did not say why it was you altered your original fixed intention of sending per Rail: no doubt for good reasons.—I am much pleased in knowing that your first lot by “Australia” had safely reached its destination, and of the <hi rend="italic">work already in view</hi>, but (as you truly observe) “the sinews of war” must be <hi rend="italic">regularly </hi>forthcoming (<hi rend="italic">keep to that</hi>): I am pleased, too, at dear little Victor’s remark—that “you have been away long enough, now!” (Bless the dear child.)</p>
         <p>I hope you are getting through your <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> job, well, and will have no difficulty in arranging <hi rend="italic">re</hi> transit:—I notice that Whitcombe has been removed to Invercargill, trust this may not affect you. Did I <hi rend="italic">forget </hi>to tell you what I had in my mind—viz. that, while you were there, in going to and fro, <hi rend="italic">to pass through my grounds, &amp; brother w. you.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>My situation is something like that of Tantalus—I <hi rend="italic">see </hi>the forests (my old, well-known haunts) all around me, but have not strength enough to visit them! My 2 rooms, too, being upstairs, I see more of them. I have read your Morris’ poetry—many passages, aye <hi rend="italic">pieces</hi>, therein I like, insomuch that I have read them <hi rend="italic">twice</hi>, but, alas! it is now like what we are <hi rend="italic">told</hi> of the man who beholds himself in a mirror &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">straightway</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> forgets</hi> &amp;c &amp;c.——</p>
         <p>You say—“You expect your brother will be leaving by Rail tomorrow”:—I will (D.V.) look-out for him on platform in passing—provided I am well enough, (today suffering from semi-lumbago, caused, no doubt, by the <hi rend="italic">sudden </hi>change, again! in the weather—cold rain this mg.) and it does not rain heavily.—</p>
         <p>I think you have some remaing. copies of those pamphlets you ptd. for me if so, perhaps, you could send them up to my house before you leave.</p>
         <p>My <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> (&amp; weak voice) still continues: both the Dr. here (McLennan in adjg. room), &amp; Robertshawe remark on my cough. There is much of sickness about,—typhoid fever, &amp; influenza cases. Since my last to you I ventured on a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> stroll into the nearer wood—only to admire (once more!) &amp; to have surer proof of extreme weakness—want of vigour—ability.—<hi rend="italic">This Dr. </hi>too, had influenza at Home w. a relapse! and he <hi rend="italic">still feels the effects</hi>! He says, the <hi rend="italic">second </hi>attack was very severe; and he derived much benefit from his voyage. He caught a relapse through attending to a patient w. a broken leg, &amp;c.—– Kelly, Interpreter (arrived here last night from N.) tells me, that his son who had an attack of Infl. in Novr., has <hi rend="italic">just now </hi>got <hi rend="italic">another</hi>!—–</p>
         <p>If I mistake not, <hi rend="italic">tomorrow </hi>Feby.1, is <hi rend="italic">the </hi>day <hi rend="italic">fixed </hi>for annual meeting of H.B. Ph. Inst., but <hi rend="italic">not </hi>advd.! Should such come off during your sojourn I should like for you to be present (if you cod. well do so,)—at same time, now that you are <hi rend="italic">bonaf. </hi>become a citizen of Wgn. I think you should <hi rend="italic">remove your name to that auxy. branch N.Z.I.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Did you read the <hi rend="italic">astounding </hi>statement in “Herald” of Friday last, (4p., cols. at bottom) of the wonderful <hi rend="italic">finds </hi>in Taupo mountains,<note xml:id="ftn3-566" place="foot" n="566"> A scam by two Australian prospectors who reported finding a fully-rigged sailing vessel hidden in a cave near the Waikato River.</note> And now goodbye—with kindest regards, &amp; best wishes, Yours &amp;c., W. Colenso.</p>
         <p rend="center">
            <hi rend="underline">2</hi>
         </p>
         <p>My main object in writing to you, is to say, that if you will remember to <hi rend="italic">wire </hi>in time to me, to let me know of your coming through Dvk. I will be on the platform to <hi rend="italic">see you once more</hi>! or (<hi rend="italic">better</hi> still, <hi rend="underline italic">if you can manage it</hi>,)—viz. to come by the <hi rend="italic">early</hi> mg. train, which arrives here at XII.50, so that you could be here 2 hours or so: at all events when you “<hi rend="italic">wire</hi>” <hi rend="italic">be sure </hi>you do so w. a “<hi rend="underline italic">collect</hi>”:—I shall <hi rend="underline italic">gladly</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">pay charges</hi>.—</p>
         <p>On meeting you I will give you your Morris Poetry—w. thanks for the loan. You say, you greatly like his “Apology,” I have also read it 3 times—I like his “Wanderer,” also several others, especially those you have <hi rend="italic">gently </hi>marked.!!</p>
         <p>By the way—If, in passing, to P.O., &amp;c., you would look in at Craig’s &amp; see, if C. has the “Epic of Hades”; also the <hi rend="italic">last vol </hi>of “Good Words” (you mention), &amp; let him send them on to me <hi rend="underline italic">here</hi>: as Book postage is cheap <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, and I have <hi rend="underline italic">too much</hi> of <hi rend="italic">idle time</hi>!!—–</p>
