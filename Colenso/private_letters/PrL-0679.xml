         <p rend="end">Friday mg</p>
         <p>Mr Harding</p>
         <p>My Dr Sir</p>
         <p>I thank you for sending me an early copy of “Typo.”—Last night, at X., being tired of writing, I took it up &amp; was much pleased, &amp; thank you for coming out fairly &amp; reasonably: only, I would I had known of it as I could perhaps have told you a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> more: from one of the <hi rend="italic">leading</hi> Hotel proprietors in Town, I was told (in the first week of the “Address” appearing) that <hi rend="italic">I had hit the right nail on the head, &amp; he was glad of it, re those reports of theatrical performances</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">written by themselves</hi>—&amp;c.—</p>
         <p>And so, in other points. I am particularly pleased at your bringing forward Bob Price’s hyper-criticisms: I had intended to have remarked thereon at our last meeting—had arranged w. <hi rend="italic">Hill</hi> to bring it forward there—but <hi rend="italic">H. </hi>(somehow) <hi rend="italic">failed </hi>in <hi rend="italic">that</hi>—<hi rend="underline italic">also</hi>.</p>
         <p>I should like to have 3 copies extra of this no. of Typo, &amp; 3 of the one before—if this last is ready today in time for M. could you send up by Holt at noon, or so?</p>
         <p>But I do not care for (<hi rend="italic">nor wish to see</hi>) “Jub. P.” <hi rend="italic">today</hi>—so don’t hurry them. <hi rend="underline italic">I shall not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> send any out by this S.F. Mail</hi>. I omitted in my haste yesterday to mention—let the <hi rend="italic">back </hi>of the little book be done up <hi rend="italic">square &amp; neat </hi>(like those from Wgn. &amp;c) &amp; not bunchy &amp; loose: &amp; <hi rend="italic">very little</hi> paste be used. </p>
         <p>Yrs truly            W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Hindered last night by a visitor  <lb/>  shall scarcely get my letters ready.</p>
