         <p rend="end">Napier, N.Z.,<lb/>Saty evg., Oct. 20/77.</p>
         <p>A. Luff. Esq.,</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,—Here am I a-scribbling to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> again! I returned <hi rend="italic">this mg</hi>. about 1 a.m. from <hi rend="italic">Wairoa</hi>! Of course my rapid movements were most unexpected: had any one assured me that I should have gone to W. &amp; back within 48 hours I cod. not have believed him. I left <hi rend="italic">home</hi> at XI. on Wednesday nt., land. at W. by 1 p.m. on Thursday, having anchored 2ce.—once, off Mohaka, to land cargo &amp; passgrs.,—&amp; once, outside Wairoa’s (dreaded) Bar until the tide should flow sufficiently. During Thursday aftn. I visited the School, (merely to <hi rend="italic">look</hi> about &amp; to shew myself!) &amp; also Willy’s Hop gardens which are looking well,—vigorous &amp; healthy. I went <hi rend="italic">early </hi>to bed, &amp; on Friday took school from IX—I (4 hours) &amp; finding—that the next Steamer (“Result”)—<hi rend="italic">under the most favourable circumstances</hi>—would not be here before Thursday next to leave for Napier on Friday 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—(while judging from the past—throughout 6–8 months—I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be shut up <hi rend="italic">there </hi>for a fortnight—or even more)—I made up my mind to return by the steamer which brought me, (as I could not induce the Capt. to stay even another tide—so fearful are they <hi rend="italic">now </hi>of the 2 <hi rend="italic">Bars. </hi>Napier &amp; Wairoa,)—and left W. at 1 p.m. yesterday: <hi rend="italic">in one sense most unwillingly</hi>. I would have staid for 2, 3, or 4, days, longer <hi rend="italic">if there were any </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">certainty</hi>—but there was <hi rend="italic">none</hi>.—We had another long passage back through head wind, &amp; heavy head sea, &amp; then, at Ahuriri, waiting for the tide to make; as it was we dragged 200 yds over the Bar!—&amp; glad &amp; <hi rend="italic">thankful</hi> was I to get safely under my own <hi rend="italic">quiet </hi>roof again! But I am <hi rend="italic">not </hi>yet myself; James, my man—to whom I had telegraphed was down at wharf, w. a trap.—(I would not write all this to you, did I not know that, you are a <hi rend="italic">similar</hi> sailor to myself, &amp; <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">can </hi>sympathise.)</p>
         <p>I did <hi rend="italic">not </hi>see D. Black at Wairoa, &amp; only saw Witty for a few minutes, who honr. promd. to see me again at steamer, which he <hi rend="italic">did not</hi>.—</p>
         <p>On my return I found a note from Lambert (enclosed)—&amp; first thing this mg. I sent him your <hi rend="italic">address</hi>—telling him that you did <hi rend="italic">not reside </hi>there.—</p>
         <p>I send you 3–4 latest papers to date which will give you <hi rend="italic">last news. </hi>Col. Whitmore is Col. Secy.—But, they say the G. Grey Ministry <hi rend="italic">cannot </hi>stand. W. Marshall has <hi rend="italic">resigned </hi>his curacy (or “Incumbency”!!) owing to his not agreeing with <hi rend="italic">his people</hi>; I think he is much to blame; but he has <hi rend="italic">always </hi>had Church <hi rend="italic">building</hi> on the brain! He might have lived very quietly &amp; <hi rend="italic">usefully </hi>(in his own <hi rend="italic">little circle </hi>at Havelock:) &amp; now, as things are, he has left, or will leave, a hornet’s nest for his successor.—You will see in “Herald” all about <hi rend="italic">Gaelic </hi>meeting at Kaikoura <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Sir Donald’s <hi rend="italic">memory</hi>; I find they have put <hi rend="italic">me </hi>down prominently in their Commee.—It is true <hi rend="italic">I </hi>was the Europn. who <hi rend="italic">recd. him</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, in ’51 (at Waitangi), but he put me out of my off. as Treasr., &amp; was the negative means of the N.Z. Exn. not being carried on: but all that is, &amp; must now be, forgotten. There is to be an Indian Famine public meeting on Tuesday next, we must all give something,—but there is (&amp; <hi rend="italic">will be</hi>) much <hi rend="italic">needed</hi> here among us.</p>
         <p>I thought I would scrawl you a <hi rend="italic">last</hi> word. Please send on enclosed note, it will cost you 1d.!! </p>
         <p>Ever yours truly, W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>I have received a copy of the Christchurch “Sun” from Mr Suter w. compliments; has <hi rend="italic">he </hi>anything to do with it? The “Sun” has copied freely from my long letter on the Tamil Bell.</p>
