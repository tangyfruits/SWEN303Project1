         <p rend="end">Thursday night<lb/>July 29th</p>
         <p>My dear Dr Hector</p>
         <p>I little thought when I wrote to you just 2 days ago I should be so soon at it again.</p>
         <p>In town this mg. I strolled into the Athenæum (a thing I rarely do) to see the Waipawa paper of yesterday <hi rend="italic">re</hi> John Harding &amp; the Maoris there,—if there was any thing <hi rend="italic">new</hi>.—I was not a little surprised when I saw the <hi rend="italic">article</hi>! so much of J. Wh. to the life (just as I had recently written to you!—as if I had done it—or had been talking w. any one. I don’t know who is the Editor—Mr Wilson, whose name is at the end, <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a cand. for the Ministry in the Presbyt. Ch., &amp; now occasionally takes a Service—but I don’t know him, never having spoken to him.—</p>
         <p>There is also more truth in what is said therein <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the Lexicon than in <hi rend="italic">many</hi> of the sayings of <hi rend="italic">your Talkers</hi>!</p>
         <p>     Yours ever</p>
         <p>             (In haste) W. Colenso.</p>
