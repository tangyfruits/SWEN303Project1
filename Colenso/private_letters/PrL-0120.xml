         <p rend="end">Church Mission Station, <lb/>Waitangi, Hawkes Bay, <lb/>New Zealand, October 12, 1852.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs, </p>
         <p>My last to you was dated, March 3, 1852; which, with enclosures, I trust you have safely received.— </p>
         <p>For some time past (down to the present hour) I have exerted myself in copying out a portion or my Journal; upwards of a 100 pages of which I now send you via Wellington, by a little vessel going thither; and hope to send you more shortly.— </p>
         <p>I also enclose a copy of a correspondence which I have recently had with one of the Popish Priests of this place. This man has very recently left this neighbourhood, (it is said) for Wanganui—to trouble Mr. Taylor &amp; his flock. It is the same person who, two years ago, gave both Archdn. W. Williams and Mr. Hamlin so much annoyance. He returned no answer to my Letter. </p>
         <p>I have not time at present to write any more; And, if I had, I could not use it so as to send by this opportunity—as the vessel sails directly.—</p>
         <p>The Rev. J.S. Grace was here in August, and I assisted him to administer the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Supper at 6 villages (including the Station); the total number of Communicants being above 350, of whom nearly 100 were new. There would have been a much greater number, had I chosen to admit <hi rend="italic">all</hi> those Communicants who are still unconfirmed; this, however, I did not think proper to do; at least, not at <hi rend="italic">this</hi> time.— </p>
         <p>In July last I obtained a grant of Land for a Mission Station from the Chiefs, Proprietors. This piece of Land, which may measure 100 acres, is nearly a day’s journey inland (S.W.) from this, and near to the lake and village of the Rotoatara. It contains both wood (timber) &amp; water; and is, I think, eligibly situated, both as regards the resident Missionary and the Natives. The deed of gift has been made out and signed in the clearest and most open manner, without a single dissentient voice; &amp; from the number &amp; rank of the persons (proprietors) engaged in making the transfer, I cannot but believe, that a demand for payment (such as we have often been tried with here) will never be made.— </p>
         <p>The Native tribes about me are all tolerably quiet <hi rend="italic">at present</hi>, preparing for the return of the Government Land Agent to pay them their 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. instalment. Two Magistrates have just been appointed for this neighbourhood: one, being Mr. Alexander, whose name has been more than once noticed in my Journal; the other is a stranger.— </p>
         <p>My own health is pretty good, save a pain in my chest, (which has been almost constant and, I think, increasing, during the last 3 or 4 months, and which every sermon I preach makes me feel anew,) and my right shoulder, which I strained through a fall received in travelling in the summer, and which still pains me considerably at times. </p>
         <p>I am, </p>
         <p>My dear Sirs</p>
         <p>William Colenso. </p>

            <hi rend="bold">[1] </hi>Copy of a letter written to Rev<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> J. Lamplie; P. Priest in answer to his dated 17 May 1852.—<note xml:id="ftn1-172" place="foot" n="172"> p.347. His name was “Lampila”.

         <p rend="end">“Waitangi, Sunday night, May 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. 1852.</p>
         <p>To</p>
         <p>Rev. J. Lampilie,</p>
         <p>&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>
         <p>Pa Kowhai.</p>
         <p> “Sir,</p>
         <p>“Your note of the 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. instant I duly received and should have replied to it instantly had I not been very much engaged, and had it not, also been written in French.—For, it is now more than 20 years since I used that language; and I recollect telling Monsr. Reignier, your coadjutor, that, through long disuse, I had quite forgotten the little I once knew.—</p>
         <p>Notwithstanding, I have endeavoured to comprehend your meaning:—should I, however have been so unfortunate to misunderstand you, I pray you to impute it to any thing save design on my part.—</p>
         <p>First, Sir, allow me to express my very great surprise at receiving any note at all from you; when I consider, that you have ever spoken of me as a “<hi rend="italic">heretic</hi>”, and that it is but a very short time since you wrote a long letter of accusations against me to my Bishop! That surprise, however, has now been completely surpassed when I read;— “J’ignore, monsieur, le dessin que vous avez en de m’envoyer certain livre pour vous venger d’une indirect et innocente, alterque qui n’a pas même été provoqué per noci”!!<note xml:id="ftn1-173" place="foot" n="173"> “Sir, I do not know what design you have in sending me a certain book to avenge yourself in an indirect and innocent way, <hi rend="italic">and otherwise</hi> which has not even been provoked by us.”</note>—Admirable, monsieur!—Surely you have altogether forgotten the fact of your having sent me, by the young Chief Cranmer Te Nahu, a Roman Catholic Newspaper, containing an account of some of the Clergy of the English Church, one of whom was an “Archbishop,” (!!!) who had lately gone over to your party? Against the name of the “Archbishop” you had written the word “pikopa” on the margin of the newspaper: telling also, the young Chief,—that if I dared to contradict the statement you would immediately call for a public “Committee” to put me down as a liar. Hence it was, that I, in return, sent you one of the Reports of our Missionary Society, (which I happened to have at hand), that you might also <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>know, that whilst some had left us to join you, others had also left you to join us.—</p>
         <p>You inform me, Sir, of “une centaine de l’école d’Oxford, et une soixantaine de l’école de Cambridge,”<note xml:id="ftn1-174" place="foot" n="174"> “about 100 from Oxford, and about 60 from Cambridge.”</note> as having joined the Romish Church:—and then you add, “ou l’on voit clairement que c’est <hi rend="italic">l’œuvre du ciel</hi>.”<note xml:id="ftn1-175" place="foot" n="175"> “where one sees clearly that it is <hi rend="italic">the work of heaven</hi>.”</note> (!!!) This, however, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to me quite conclusive: the leap is far too prodigious. (And here, I might, I think, very appropriately use one of your own sentences,— “Car———il y a un peu de distance, à moins que vous ayez la faculté de marier ensemble de chose opposée.”<note xml:id="ftn1-176" place="foot" n="176"> “For———there is a little distance, even if you have the ability of marrying together opposite things.”</note>—But,) Allow me to ask, Have you forgotten how Elias in ancient times complained,— “<hi rend="italic">Ego relictus sum solus</hi>”?—that out of the little band of 12 chosen Apostles, one became an Apostate?—that, of those who for a season followed our Saviour Christ, “<hi rend="italic">multi discipulorum ejus abierunt retro: et jam non cum illo ambulabant</hi>”?—that, holy S. Paul prophecied to the Church at Ephesus, “<hi rend="italic">ex vobis ipsis exurgent viri loquentes perversa, ut abducant discipulos post se</hi>”?—and complained, (at the close of his long and laborious life,) “<hi rend="italic">aversi sunt a me omnes qui in Asia sunt</hi>;” and, “<hi rend="italic">omnes me dereliquerunt</hi>”?—And, that, in later times, it was (almost proverbially,) said; that the whole world (i.e. the church) was against Athanasius, and he alone against the world? Of all such persons whatsoever, or how many soever they may be, it may be very truly said,<hi rend="underline"> </hi>(in the words of the holy Apostle S. John,)—“<hi rend="italic">Ex nobis prodierunt, sed non erant ex nobis”</hi>
         </p>
         <p>—But allow me, Sir, to enquire, whether you really hold; that such goings over to any party are to be taken as <hi rend="underline italic">the proof </hi>of that party holding the truth? If so, it is, to say the least of it, a novel one: such an one as was never once dreamed of in the primitive ages, no, not even by the Church’s <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>greatest enemies.—When, in your own country, several bishops and priests of your church,—among whom I may just mention ; Talleyrand, Bishop of Aulun; De Savines of Viviers; De Jarante of Orleans; Gobel, Bishop of Lydda and afterwards of Paris, Miroudet of Babylon, Gay Vernon, Lindet, Lalande, Lequin, Chabol, Massieu, Marolles, Torné, Pellalier, Thibauld, Minée, Henruidin, Huguet, Lefessier, Panisset, &amp;c. &amp;c.,—when these men sent in to the Convention their letters of Orders, mitres, and Episcopal ornaments, and declared, that there ought to be no worship but that of reason, liberty and equality,—was this an indication of the truth—“<hi rend="underline italic">l’œuvre du ceil</hi>”? Truth, Sir, eternal immutable Truth, is always the same, whether crowded around by innumerable hosts , or, whether standing solitary and unregarded.—</p>
         <p>Further:—you state,— “ou je trouverais mille conversions de protestant au catholicisme, contre un de nộtre fait protestant.”<note xml:id="ftn1-177" place="foot" n="177"> “where I will find 1000 conversions from protestant to Catholicism, against one of ours turned protestant.”</note>—Such may have been the case; Yet, allow me, Sir, to doubt it. Be this as it may, <hi rend="underline italic">one thing is certain</hi>; for we (you and I) have it <hi rend="underline italic">here</hi> in this country before our eyes;—that it is a very easy matter for you to make a Romanist of either a Heathen or a nominal Protestant.—A few words and a few drops of water from you, and, lo! the matter is accomplished, the Heathen is made a Roman-Catholic!!—</p>
         <p>—But, Sir, when you speak, as you often do of your enormous numbers, has it, never occurred to you, that our Saviour spoke of His Church as a “<hi rend="italic">pusillus grex</hi>”?—And of a “<hi rend="italic">angusta porta, et arcta via est, que ducit ad vitam; et pauci sunt, qui inveniunt cam</hi>”?—And, that, the “<hi rend="italic">lata porta; et spateosa via est, quæ ducit ad perditionem, et mulli sunt qui intrant peream</hi>”?</p>
         <p>Again: you say in your Note,— “Vous avez pensé sans doute que j’étais étranger à l’énsiegnement des protestants.”<note xml:id="ftn1-178" place="foot" n="178"> “Doubtless you thought I was a stranger to protestant teaching.”</note>—I would, from my heart, that you really knew the doctrines of “Protestants”; you would then cease speaking <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>of them as “<hi rend="italic">Heretics.</hi>”—For, what is Heresy? (In the words of an ancient Bishop:)— “<hi rend="italic">Est enim hæresis destitutio salutis, abjectio gratiæ Dei discessio a corpore et spirita Christi</hi>.”—And, in the words of a modern Divine, Heresy is the <hi rend="italic">pertinacious</hi> denial of some truth <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> revealed. Do not forget, that the Apostle Paul was also charged with “<hi rend="italic">heresy</hi>”; by those, too, who considered themselves as being alone the church of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>. Let us never forget his reply—“<hi rend="italic">Confiteor autem hoc tibi, quod secundam sectam quam dicunt hæresim, sic deservio Patri Deo meo, credens omnibus quæ in lege et prophetio Scripta sunt: spem habens in Deum, &amp;c</hi>.” I earnestly desire that you, Sir, would consider (however briefly,) the teaching of the English Church:—She gives the word of the living <hi rend="smallcaps">God,</hi> of Christ, and of His holy Apostles, <hi rend="underline italic">unadulterated</hi> to her children: from the Book <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, as from a perennial fount, she draws all truths necessary to be received: she holds (as precious jewels) the 3 great and ancient symbols of the Christian Church; which, as a faithful keeper and witness, she preserves pure, and transmits to succeeding generations.—<hi rend="italic">How then, Sir, can she be heretical</hi>? or,<hi rend="underline"> </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">How can anyone of her Ministers, so acting be a Heretic</hi>? On the contrary, <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, her sons, <hi rend="italic">hate Heresy</hi>; <hi rend="italic">we hold</hi> the ancient rules of the Catholic Fathers, as good against all Heretics,— “<hi rend="italic">id esse verum, quodcunque primum: id esse adulterum, quadcungue posterius</hi>”: and “<hi rend="italic">quod ubique , quod semper, quod abomnibus</hi>” By <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> grace, Sir, with Augustine, I ever hope to say, “<hi rend="italic">errare possum, hæreticus nesse nolo</hi>.” </p>
         <p>There are, also, some sentences in your note which I do not clearly understand; such as,— “je vous priorai, quand vous vendrez me donner quelque chose qui combatte la Religion Catholique, de ne pas vous appuyer sur les armes de Calviniste, &amp;c.”<note xml:id="ftn1-179" place="foot" n="179"> “I beseech you, when you come to give me something which combats the Catholic Religion, not to lean on Calvinist arms, &amp;c.”</note>—and again, “Si vous voulez vous battre contradictoirement à coup de livre de <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>controverse, je vous en donnerai dix contre un, où vous trouverez refuter, &amp;c.”<note xml:id="ftn1-180" place="foot" n="180"> “If you want to beat yourself contradictorily with a book of controversy, I will give you ten to one, where you will find to refute, &amp;c.”</note>—If, by these words, you desire to convey a challenge to me, to dispute with you upon the novel dogmas of the Romish Creed, I am quite ready to do so. Only, Sir, remember your own words;—let it be, “<hi rend="italic">d ùne manière aussi solide que légitime</hi>.”<note xml:id="ftn1-181" place="foot" n="181"> “In a manner as solid as it is legitimate.”</note>
         </p>
         <p>I pass by, as unworthy of my present notice, your constant assumption of the name of “<hi rend="italic">Catholic</hi>”. The very meaning of the word being quite sufficient to expose the fallacy—for, how can a part be equal to the whole?—</p>
         <p>Our blessed Saviour, Christ, warns his disciples, saying, “<hi rend="italic">Videte, nequis vos seducat; multum enim venient in nomine meo, dicentes, Ego sum Christus; et multos seducent.— — Surgent enim pseudochristi et pseudoprophetæ et dabunt signa magna et prodigia; ita ut in errorem inducantur (si fieri potest) etiam electi</hi>.”—S. Paul in like manner, cautions the Collossian Church with, “<hi rend="italic">Videte ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam; et inanem fallaciam, secundum traditionem hominum, secundum elementa mundi, et non secundum Christum</hi>:”—and again, “<hi rend="italic">Nemo vos seducat volens in humililate, et religione angelorum quæ non vidit ambulans, frustra inflatus sensu carnis suæ</hi>.”—S. John tells the churches, “<hi rend="italic">Nilote omni spiritu credere, sed probate spirititus si ex Des sint: quonciam multi pseudoprophetæ exierunt in mundum</hi>.”—And, Jude exhorts them, saying, “<hi rend="italic">deprecans supercertari semel traditæ sanctis fidei</hi>.” But, how is this to be done? Truly, even as our Saviour and Exemplar Christ fought the father of all heresies, with the “<hi rend="italic">gladium spiritus, quod est verbum Dei</hi>.” It was from this armoury alone (of the Scriptures), that the holy Catholic Fathers contended against the heretics of old. Augustine (in his controversy with Polilian, the Donatist,) thus writes.—“<hi rend="italic">Ne, inquit, audiantur internos hæc verba, Ego dico, aut Tu dicis: sic potuis dicamus, Hæc dicit </hi>
            <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Dominus</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Ibi quarramus culesiam: ibi disculiamus caudam nostrum</hi>.” Thus also speaks Jerome “<hi rend="italic">Omniæ, inquit, caquæ abague testimonio Scriptorum quasi tradite ab Apostolis asseruntur percutiuntum gladio Dei</hi>.” Thus, also, writes Ambrose to the Emperor Gratian,— “<hi rend="italic">Interrogentur, inquit Scripturae, interrogentur Apostoli, interrogentur Prophetæ, interrogentur Christus</hi>.” And, as I have this day read the words of the Holy Apostle S. Peter (whose words are highly suitable here) in the Epistle for the day, (which Epistle is, I believe, also read this day in your own Church,)— “<hi rend="italic">Liquis loquitur , quasi sermones Dei: si quis ministral, tanquam ex virtute, quam administrat Deus: ut in omnibus honorificetur Deus per Jesum Christum: cui est gloria it imperium in sæcula sæculorum: Amen</hi>.”—</p>
         <p>If then; we meet to dispute, <hi rend="italic">let it be to elicit </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">Truth</hi>. Let this be our <hi rend="underline italic">method</hi>,— “<hi rend="italic">Si quis loquitur, quasi sermones Dei</hi>” Let this be our <hi rend="underline italic">aim</hi>, “<hi rend="italic">ut in omnibus honorificetur Deus per Jesum Christum</hi>.”—</p>
         <p>We have the words of our Saviour Christ; we have the writings of the holy Apostles and Prophets;— “<hi rend="italic">ex quibus</hi>,” (to use the words of an ancient Confessor,) “<hi rend="italic">et omnis veritas, et doctrinæ Catholicæ probari possit, et omnis hæresis refutari</hi>.”—(2 Tim. <hi rend="smallcaps">iii</hi>. 15–17)</p>
         <p>I have now, Sir, answered your note, and that more largely than I originally intended. In so doing I have given you the whole of my Sunday evening and night—my only truly leisure time. Should you choose to write to me again, I will thank you to do so in the New Zealand tongue, (which will be, without doubt , a reciprocal benefit,) in which I will also respond.—</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Sir.</p>
         <p>Your sincere well wisher, </p>
         <p>William Colenso,</p>
         <p>Missionary, of the Church of England.</p>
