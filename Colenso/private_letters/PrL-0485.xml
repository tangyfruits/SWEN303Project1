         <p rend="end">Napier Saty. night Feby. 11, ’82</p>
         <p>My dear Capt. Russell</p>
         <p>Thanks many for your kind note of yesty. I have (since readg. it) written to J.Wh!—wh. will leave here My. m. as I find he is now at Wgn. A copy I shall enclose for your inform.</p>
         <p>No doubt, (as I sd. To you in my last) you will note that it is short. As you truly qu.— “Is not Bryce now the man!”—But <hi rend="italic">how</hi> can I write again <hi rend="italic">to him</hi>? Unless I were to do so to remind him of his predecessor’s kind promise in so doing (&amp; of his own clear contrary acting). On the other hand, I know that Robt. still often signs &amp;c <hi rend="italic">for that</hi> Dept., espy. in abs. of B.—B. is now at the N. Be all that as it may, I shall have endeavoured to do my plain duty in the matter, &amp; long uphill<hi rend="italic"> </hi>wk. though!</p>
         <p>I am with you, in saying, “Alas.” in yr. having no V. at <hi rend="italic">present</hi>—but do not forget, it is only <hi rend="italic">for the present</hi>—3 short years only, of which more than <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">18</hi>
            <hi rend="sup">th</hi>. has already <hi rend="italic">passed</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">long befr. </hi>the end I hope the eyes of <hi rend="italic">many</hi>, in newconstituencies will be opened, &amp; then look out for the welc. change. I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> not, but H.B. <hi rend="italic">will </hi>see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> rightly returned again.</p>
         <p>And belg. this,—&amp; also, that R. <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> not only the diff. betn. the 2 competitors, but the very narrow majy. oppd., he, as a M. of the Govt., cannot, dare not prudently shove aside or make light of yr. request.</p>
         <p>             I am my dr Sir<lb/>                     Yrs faithy<lb/>                         WC</p>
