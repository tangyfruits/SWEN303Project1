         <p rend="end">Napier, Sunday night,<lb/>June 4. 1882.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Rolleston</p>
         <p>Last night I received from the Native Office, printed proofs of specimen pages of the Maori Lexicon for correction, with a request that I would return them early. I have just finished going closely through them, and am sending them to P.O. to go by early morning mail to Wn.</p>
         <p>As it was owing to your especial kindness, last year, when Nat. Minister, that those Mss. specimen pages were <hi rend="italic">promised</hi> to be printed,—and, again, subsequently, that I was to read the proofs for correction for press, (for both of which I again thank you,)—I feel the more inclined to write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> at this time,—to ask you still further to aid me, <hi rend="italic">if it be required.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The proofs sent, contain about <hi rend="sup ">4</hi>/<hi rend="sub">5</hi>ths. of what I had originally sent to Sir Donald McLean,—being the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> lot forwarded to him. I sent the Mss. in <hi rend="italic">two</hi> lots, as he had hurried me, and I was given to understand, that it was to go immediately into the Printer’s hands, so that, while I was copying fairly the latter portion, he could be going on with the former. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> part contained a portion from <hi rend="bold">A</hi> and <hi rend="bold">U</hi> (vowels), the <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, just 2 verbs under <hi rend="bold">T</hi>., or, as Sir Donald had put it,— “a little from the beginning and from the end of the Work.”—</p>
         <p>Now as this sent to me is only the <hi rend="italic">former </hi>portion, and there is no reference to any more,—I write to you,—to ask you to kindly get the remaining portion also printed, as it is almost necessary, in order to give a fair sample of the Work. For few verbs in Maori begin with a vowel; and now that so much, comparatively, has been, at last! accomplished, it would be a great pity to omit the small remaining portion.</p>
         <p>I might also add, that from the time of your kindly consenting last year, not a few scholars in England and elsewhere, were quite buoyed up “on the word of Mr. Rolleston.”</p>
         <p>Apologizing for intruding, especially at this busy time with you, (for I have neither Capt. Russell nor Mr. Ormond now at Wellington!)</p>
         <p>                             Believe me,<lb/>                                                Dear Mr Rolleston<lb/>                                          Yours truly,<lb/>                                                       Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I think I shall write to Mr. Bryce, officially, by early Mail: it is too late now, &amp; I am too tired.—</p>
