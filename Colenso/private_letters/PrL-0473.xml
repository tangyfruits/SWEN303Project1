         <p rend="end">Napier, Novr. 16, 1881.</p>
         <p>Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I am in receipt of your note of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst., in which you express your desire to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the 2 Teeth, of which I had sent you a sketch. I now send them to you in a small registered packet, with this note. I had to see their owner and get his consent; and I also showed them at our ordinary Institute meeting last Monday evening.</p>
         <p>Enclosed I send you a clipping from yesterday’s evening Paper, containing a brief <hi rend="italic">résumé </hi>of our evening’s work. The 2 short Papers then read, I will forward in a few days, with the specimens of the new plants and shells, for your Museum. I purpose going again to the “Bush” next week, as I much wish to find a few Crypts. in fructification: hoping to have far better weather than I had <hi rend="italic">last </hi>time (in October), when, out of 8 days, 6 were rainy &amp; bitterly cold,—and I got both drenching<hi rend="italic">s</hi> &amp; a severe cold (which is only just leaving me!) and some nice specimens of <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ</hi>, &amp;c.—When I return I will again write.</p>
         <p>     Yours truly</p>
         <p>             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Yesterday I wrote a brief note to Mr. Gore for 4 vols. Trans. (X.–XIII.)—hope I may be spared them.—</p>
