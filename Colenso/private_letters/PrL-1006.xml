         <p rend="end">Napier, September<lb/>10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1897.</p>
         <p>Dear Hans Mortensen</p>
         <p>I must no longer put off writing to you: I should have done so before, only I was waiting to see how I might get on—in general health, or rather, in <hi rend="italic">gaining strength.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I duly received your kind and loving letter of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> August, and I thank you for it. I have also received a letter from Mr. Shugar—containing a kind invitation to your great National Demonstration, soon now to come off, and I have answered it, (perhaps you may hear of my reply before this reaches you.) Dear Hans, I have been obliged to say—that I much fear <hi rend="italic">I shall not </hi>be with you at your meeting. I am sorry for this, but I cannot help it: I am but <hi rend="italic">very slowly</hi> gaining strength. I returned to Napier on the 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> July, and have only been <hi rend="italic">twice </hi>down to the town:—each time in a trap from my door here, and so brought back, and helped in and out of the trap, and when down in the town, I walk with some difficulty: my arm and hand are much better; last week, I could use my right hand to wash my face and, for the <hi rend="italic">first time</hi>, to button the collar of my <hi rend="italic">shirt</hi>—after many trials, and much patience. The wet weather we have been having for a long time, was very much against me, as I could not get outside to take walking exercise, but during this week I have been able to do so,—and though I should like to be with you, <hi rend="italic">I must not run any </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">great risk</hi>. I told Mr. Shugar in my letter, that, as the fixed day <hi rend="italic">drew nigh</hi>, I would write again, if I found that I could not go.—</p>
         <p>I hope you, and yours, and your dear father-in-law are all quite well: remember me most lovingly to him.</p>
         <p>I had a letter from Axel a few days ago, he was pretty well, but did <hi rend="italic">not </hi>like his dangerous work, and he is right: I wish he would leave it, as I told him before: that needle that was in his foot has come out: I am very glad to know this, as I feared what might happen if it remained in his foot. Axel says , he had not heard from you for some time. Axel’s letter was dated 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. August, but he adds to it, on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. August, saying, “since I wrote this letter 25 men were knocked off, so I have no work now, but I am going to have a look round, and the wife will not let me work in a mine again.” (and she is <hi rend="italic">right.</hi>) Axel says, the cattle trade, fat ones for butchering, would pay well: I hope the dear fellow will get on.</p>
         <p>Good bye, Dear Hans.—Kind remembrances to your good wife, &amp; love to your children. And, may our Heavenly Father’s blessing be with you—always. </p>
         <p>         Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                                         W. Colenso.</p>
