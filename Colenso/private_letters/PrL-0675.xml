         <p rend="end">Napier <lb/>August 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>/88</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour <lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>It is late, and I am tired, but your mail (once a week only) leaves N tomorrow, &amp; I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write before I drop tools. I have been going to write for a week past, but I have been waiting on the Printer, re my “Address” paper which came out of his hands (in part) yesterday 50 books—and today 100 more—and so I am able to send 2 to Glenross with this. I have been busy all day making up &amp; dissecting,&amp;c.­</p>
         <p>Of course you saw in the local papers some <hi rend="italic">small</hi> notice of your <hi rend="italic">Clianthus</hi> specimens. I had been expecting them for some days, &amp; Hamilton (who was here w. me on the Monday <hi rend="italic">morning</hi> (day of meeting) to know if I had any pa­per, <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, that no specimens would come from you. At 7.30pm I went down to the meeting, arrived at 8, when H told me the box of spns had that evening arrived from you, and he opened, &amp; put them on table. Nothing more could be done, they were looked at—and a few words said about by Dr S &amp; myself. When I returned to my house (by xi pm) I found your letter of 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> July—which my man had brought up from P.O. at ix pm.</p>
         <p>I was unwell next day (from sleepless night, and rheumatism, having over exerted myself at the meeting) and so did not go down—but I sent word to H to get the big bunch photographed while it was fresh,—this has been done (tho not at once) &amp; it does not look well. It was a great pity I did not get the spns here on Friday or Saturday—or Monday morning. </p>
         <p>The pretty little spn in your letter is <hi rend="italic">Ozothamnus glomeratus</hi>—one of my wood darlings! To see it in flower, also—when coming into flower, it affects stony ridges, &amp;c.—not very common.—</p>
         <p>I cannot write more</p>
         <p>Kind regards. Did you get your Vol. XX?</p>
         <p>Yours truly </p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
