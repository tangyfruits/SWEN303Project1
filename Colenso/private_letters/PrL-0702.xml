         <p rend="end">Napier, Feby. 5/89.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Now that I have, at last! sent off my Eng. letters, I turn my attention to your letter of 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. Decr./88, and its enclosures. On receipt of it on Jany. 3/89, I wrote to you from the Bush a note of acknowledgement, and again on my return to this place—on my being so suddenly taken ill: I trust both notes duly reached you.—</p>
         <p>I was, and am, much interested in your work, (the photo. of “the Lord’s Prayer in Maori”, &amp;c.,) particularly in its <hi rend="italic">several </hi>borders. I was not aware of any such a photo. or drawing being in existence, as I had never seen a copy before: of course, I know the Maori borders—some of them, at least, as others are not discernible.—</p>
         <p>1. I will reply to your main question first,—<hi rend="italic">re</hi> the “carving” (said by you to) “represent the Rengarenga or sacred lily.” This is a highly correct Maori idea, as it well represents the delicately curled tips of the anthers of the Rengarenga—which I have often admired. Such curled tips to the male organs are not common, hence too the appropriate <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> scientific name of the plant (Anthericum <hi rend="italic">cirrhatum</hi>) as given it by its discoverer the botanist Forster, who accompanied Cook in his 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Voyage to N.Z. It is pleasing to observe, that Forster had noticed that peculiar character. I copy from his description of the anthers of the plant:—</p>
         <p>“Anthera oblongæ, erectæ, bisulcæ, caudidæ. Barbata corpuscular duo filiformia, purpurea, pubescentia ab anther ad basin filamenti longitudinaliter dependentia, <hi rend="italic">ibique cirrhi in </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">modum revolute</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">, parte cirrhiforme flavissima</hi>”;—that you may see how he dwelt upon it. It has, however, been removed from the old and large Linnean genus of <hi rend="italic">Anthericum</hi>, to the more modern one of <hi rend="italic">Arthropodium</hi>, Brown,—a small genus confined to Tasmania and N. Zealand.</p>
         <p>You should not expect the Maori name &amp; imitation to be <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> correct, any more than in the borders termed “Mangopare”, “Kowhai”, “Hikaua”, &amp;c. It is the <hi rend="italic">main outline</hi>, as it were, of the idea <hi rend="italic">in the old Maori mind</hi>:—association, correlation, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>As you observe, the Rengarenga is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a true Lily, although it is included in that same Natural order of <hi rend="italic">Liliaceæ.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">[about 5 lines cut from the bottom of this page]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>large size in my garden, forming tufts, or tussocks, as big round as a small coach-wheel, with leaves 2½ feet long, and 4 in. wide, and its flowering stems nearly 3 feet high: would you like some seeds?</p>
         <p rend="center">———</p>
         <p>Perhaps you will allow me to offer a few plain remarks on your photo.—</p>
         <p>1. Some of the <hi rend="italic">narrow</hi> borders, with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the 4 corners of the fine inner and clear broad border, are indistinct: so also are several of the <hi rend="italic">initial</hi> letters of the text: all this, as I take it, is owing to your having executed the original in <hi rend="italic">colours</hi>; and this (though no doubt well-done &amp; pleasing <hi rend="italic">[words cut out]</hi> drawing) spoils the photo. <hi rend="italic">[The rest is cut out].</hi>
