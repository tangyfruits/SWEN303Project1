         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>December 17/91</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Luff</p>
         <p>I was very <hi rend="italic">agreeably </hi>surprised last night in receiving a letter from you: on looking at my letters, brought in, and seeing yours, I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> it <hi rend="italic">directly</hi>. You still write as freely and as well as ever you did!—I have altered much in this respect, particularly during (or owing to) this attack of Influenza, which on its <hi rend="italic">second </hi>relapse, changed to <hi rend="italic">Bronchitis</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">nearly </hi>carried me. I am now getting round slowly—being still very weak &amp; voice small, unnatural.</p>
         <p>I trust you (and all yours) are keeping well, and free from this dire malady; though I believe that it is much less serious if care is taken not to expose one self too early—it is the <hi rend="italic">relapse</hi> that is so dangerous.</p>
         <p>You say, “You have not been any distance from Wgn. for years”: I know how active you always were, so I hope you have been <hi rend="italic">well </hi>occupied. I expect to be a prisoner here until mid-January at least, as I don’t like travelling, or staying at hotels, in the holidays.—</p>
         <p>Last evening Rev. J. Parkinson died, a good useful man, he is to be buried tomorrow, I was with him yesterday, we were good friends.</p>
         <p>I heartily wish you all the usual wishes of our forefathers, at these 2 approaching festive seasons, and w. kind regards</p>
         <p>             I am Yours truly,                               W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I have not had the pleasure of meeting with Mr. Grubb. I was surprised in hearing from Mr. Knowles (when I was in Napier for 2 days last month) that Mr. Grubb’s home is now far S! I had always supposed it was Wellington.</p>
         <p>I almost doubt the correctness of those (so called) Easter Island inscriptions and also of Dr. Carroll’s translation. W.C.</p>
