         <p>Dr Julius Haast</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>It seems a long time since I last heard from you, or (I may say) of you (as I don’t now receive any of our Southern Papers): I hope however you are well in health, and working well for both Province &amp; Colony.</p>
         <p>Sometime ago a cursory Review, a mention of you, in an English Paper, met my eye, from which I should infer you had written some work on the <hi rend="italic">Moa</hi>, which I should have liked to see.—</p>
         <p>My object in writing you now, is, to ask for the <hi rend="italic">Number </hi>of the “Annals Natural History” I lent you in July ’67, containing my little Paper on the Moa: it is my only copy, and I should not like to lose it.—</p>
         <p>I trust you know that I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get any copies of my essay on the Maories—published in Transactions Institute N.Z. vol. I.,—I tried hard, but failed to get any, otherwise I should have sent you one.</p>
         <p>My hand, which has been very bad for writing, is now better again, but I cannot yet do much at a time.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>my dear Sir</p>
         <p>yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
