         <p>A. Luff, Esq</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>A day of wrath! &amp; gloom, of wind &amp; rain—as if the tail end of a tropical gale, confines me to my room, &amp; so I make the most of it in writing to England, &amp; <hi rend="italic">to you</hi>.</p>
         <p>My last to you was on June 29; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is still <hi rend="italic">here</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> </hi>&amp; with all that mail in postmaster Grubb’s safe keeping. <hi rend="italic">You</hi>—of all our Eng. correspondents—may easily divine the reason <hi rend="italic">why</hi> you have no letters or papers by our outgoing <hi rend="italic">June </hi>mail—being our midwinter mo.—the big steamer passed on—keeping the even tenor of her way, from Wgn. to Auckld.—without calling, to the great annoyance of us all—including several passengers for England who were waiting. Worst of all the weather was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so very bad <hi rend="italic">in here</hi> that day, &amp; she passed H. Bay about noon; &amp; the surf was <hi rend="italic">too high</hi> in the evening, &amp; on following day,—I have little doubt she went on before (&amp; <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi>) the approaching S. gale, which her Bar. also (no doubt) shewed,—&amp; <hi rend="italic">so far</hi> I have taken the part of her Capt. But in my opinion it has been wholly wrong that those big Ocean Steamers should have to Coast N.Z. Islands from N. to S. to drop the Mails.—</p>
         <p>Since date of my last, I have had 2 from you: one, the <hi rend="italic">duplicate</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Cases, via Brindisi, &amp; one, yours of May 31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. which, with Papers (a lot) arrived here July 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., &amp; for all which I thank you.—</p>
         <p>And now, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, to business, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>your 7 Cases.—I have tried, &amp; done nothing, so they are <hi rend="italic">now</hi> on their way to Wgn. I hope they may get there safely.—It is a <hi rend="italic">high gale</hi>, but steamer left on Saturday, 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>., evening, &amp; will be going <hi rend="italic">before </hi>the wind.—</p>
         <p>I wrote early to Rathbone, &amp; on receiving his ansr., to Graham &amp; Co.; I had to wait several days for Graham’s reply (being winter &amp; no Steamer running) &amp;, on receiving it, I went to Spit to ship the Cases per Rangatira (on Thursday 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.)—but while there, it occurred to me to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> Kinross about the goods; I did so (after some waiting, he being engd. w. Tanner), &amp; at K’s. request I left the Invoice w. him for his salesman to see. Next mg. I got his ansr. Then I found I could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> per Rangatira as she was going first to the Bay &amp; Customs would not allow of it (I should say, I wished them to be shipped while she was alongside the wharf, &amp; <hi rend="italic">not </hi>to be <hi rend="italic">lightered out</hi>: (on the <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> mg. too,—this <hi rend="italic">latter</hi>, could be done.) Well, the “Kiwi” being also here, I made arrangements for them to go by her; &amp; now I had hoped my work was at an and; so I came back, &amp; wrote my letter (at night) to Rhodes &amp; Co. (The gale was then brewing! it has been threatening for several days.) On Saty., mg., 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>., Cook came up, in a fright, &amp; in the rain, to let me know, that the Customs <hi rend="italic">would </hi>open them, &amp; were then at it. I rushed down (as if it were a House on fire!) &amp; got in time to stop it, &amp; after a long parley w. Tabuteau, I got the good put on board “Kiwi,” &amp; so ended my troubles—of that kind; but getting damp it brought back a nasty Rheumatism and cough. Dinw., Cook, Routledge, &amp; others, say, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have succeeded with T.—It appeared, that T. had written on the Bond Store entry (3 months ago) “not to be delivd. without examination”—&amp; so, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, he had to cancel his own Instructions, &amp; write to Wgn. about them. Indeed, I was determined that had T. not given way, I would have kept them, &amp; written to Seed about them.—T. said, that it is <hi rend="italic">in such goods</hi>, others have been smuggled; (so <hi rend="italic">it was here</hi>): I did not know there were Duties on Stationery: Cook says, about ₤13. being 10%. T. makes Dinw. <hi rend="italic">open all</hi> there. I send you copies of my letters, &amp; the answers from Rathb. &amp; Grah.—I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write to <hi rend="italic">Drower</hi>—my <hi rend="italic">experience </hi>preventing me—and as Capt. Read is now <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of business which is in the hands of a Melbourne man named Adair. I did not write to him.</p>
         <p>And now in all faithfulness, I should tell you <hi rend="italic">two </hi>things: 1. that there is talk about you losing your old prudent head, in <hi rend="italic">so sending out </hi>goods; &amp; such an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>suitable lot or, rather <hi rend="underline italic">too much</hi> (for so very confined a market):—and then there is <hi rend="italic">much said</hi>, at <hi rend="italic">your</hi> expense, which is new to me, besides <hi rend="italic">this </hi>shipment,—of Furniture to Large &amp; Townley, &amp; of Ironmongery to some one else, &amp; then, the <hi rend="italic">Saddlery</hi> comes up (I <hi rend="italic">defend</hi> you <hi rend="italic">in this</hi>, as I knew all about it),—even your “friends” (?) shake their heads ominously—2. The old story of <hi rend="italic">you &amp; I</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">A. Deane</hi>! comes up again; that <hi rend="italic">we were </hi>in partnership in <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">now we are in this</hi>,—Saddlery being witness. &amp;c, &amp;c.—On the whole, much has been said even in my hearing, which is unpleasant.</p>
         <p>I hope you will be no heavy loser by those goods: you <hi rend="italic">must let me know</hi>, eventually. Why did you send the Chq. for ₤10.? <hi rend="italic">there was no need of that</hi>. Now, however, that it is here, &amp; I see you have re-numbered it, &amp;c., I will present it, when I go to town: I have pd. Cook <hi rend="italic">this day</hi>, (sent it by post) as his was part outlay.—</p>
         <p>I sent Mrs Moorhouse her letters, &amp;c, &amp; enclose her “receipt.”</p>
         <p rend="end">2 p.m.</p>
         <p>It is now blowing fearfully! &amp; raining too, wind from NE. I fear for 2 barques which came in yesterday; I have not seen such a day for some months.—The big trees in garden, &amp; around house are lashing ea. other furiously! Two days ago the yellow acacias were in all their annual glory! Now! – – – – Sic transit gloria mundi. But I must go on as I have much to tell you. I would give £5. to have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> here this evening. Tanner &amp; family leave by <hi rend="italic">next month’s</hi> Steamer: his son with E.B. Hill &amp; his sons, were only 84 days on their passage to England by “Avalanche,” fine weather all way—save a short gale at C. Horn. I hear, that H.R.R. <hi rend="underline italic">finds</hi> himself in a mess. Travers told him the other day, that, as to Arihi:—supposing she were a minor, her doings had been covered &amp; upheld by her <hi rend="italic">Trustees</hi>, &amp; by her husband,—H.R.R. got furious,— “What of my time, my exertions, my money?” &amp; soon got Hiraka, A’s. poor husband, to sign over to him all his right, life-interest, &amp;c. in some 5 or 6 lands (Arihi’s)! When A. found this out, she got ½ mad w. R., &amp; so did Hapuku &amp; all the Natives,—A. <hi rend="italic">now</hi> returns to the Govt. &amp; to Locke,—&amp; no one knows the end. H.R.R. has turned agt. Campbell Poukawa; C. had bought Chapman’s rights, &amp; R. found out that one of the grantees (a yg. woman from Waimarama) had signed—years ago—&amp; <hi rend="italic">not her husband </hi>
         </p>
         <p>She has always contentedly taken up her share, ₤22. per ann. R. now agrees to give her husband ₤50. per ann. for his wife’s share, &amp; is commencing law proceedings agt. Campbell!—To <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, all this kind of work is sickening!</p>
         <p>The Assy. are fighting still, some <hi rend="italic">ugly words</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Sir G.</hi> &amp; Sir Donald! more feuds in the distance. I send you a “Hansard”—that you may see Treasurer’s speech, &amp; note all about <hi rend="italic">Govt. raising price of Land</hi>. Karaitiana has not yet taken his seat; Locke, Sutton, Buch., Ferrard, &amp; others are <hi rend="italic">now</hi> on their way down—in this <hi rend="italic">gale</hi>!</p>
         <p>We heard of Dr. F’s. death, by telegram. Next day, the Ho. voted his daughter ₤3000. Who will succeed him? it is rumoured, Vogel,—Stafford,—Fitzherbert,—McLean.—I don’t believe any one of them will. An Offl. letter from the Crown Agents (Sir P. Julyan &amp; Mr. Sargeaunt) has been recd. by our Govt. &amp; printed—in which they say, they will never again have anything to do with Vogel!! it has made a great <hi rend="italic">stir </hi>&amp; will yet cause more. Perhaps I never told you, that Sir Penrose Julyan is my first Cousin, (my mother’s sister’s son,—just as Bp. of Natal, my father’s brother’s son),—his father, Capt. R. Julyan, was an R.N.—I <hi rend="italic">recollect</hi> them well.—I must not forget to <hi rend="italic">thank</hi> you for this excellent photo. of Bp. Natal: it is well executed—but I was disappd., as I thought it wod. prove to be <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, which I have not yet got.</p>
         <p>I suppose I told you of Bp. Wms. paralytic seizure: I <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> to see him—<hi rend="underline italic">once more</hi>, &amp; trusted to Townsend, 2 months ago, to carry my message. Last week, in talking with S. Williams, I mentioned the matter, saying I <hi rend="italic">suspected </hi>T. had <hi rend="italic">not </hi>delivd. the message, &amp; <hi rend="italic">I was right</hi>! S.W. wrote, <hi rend="italic">saying so</hi>, &amp; that the Bp. would be <hi rend="italic">very glad </hi>to see me.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="bold">[</hi>Fannin <hi rend="italic">at door</hi>, to say, our barque on shore total wreck &amp; the other <hi rend="italic">driving </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">on</hi>! don’t know if men saved:—may <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> have mercy on them!<hi rend="bold">]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>To return (if <hi rend="italic">I can</hi>!)—I went to see him, found him well <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi>, &amp; that <hi rend="italic">is all</hi>! He can <hi rend="italic">scarcely speak</hi>, intellect wandering,—just 3 or 4 words at a time; but if you can give <hi rend="italic">the key-word</hi> of his sentence or thought then he will run on for a minute or so. He <hi rend="italic">would </hi>place a chair for me by the fire (&amp; <hi rend="italic">would </hi>open the door for me when I left!)—we talked of <hi rend="underline italic">old</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> times</hi>,—&amp; of his <hi rend="italic">going</hi>, &amp; of course of <hi rend="italic">my </hi>being but a <hi rend="italic">short way</hi> behind him in the race,—&amp; of our looking <hi rend="italic">to Him</hi>, whom we had served, for help &amp; comfort; &amp; <hi rend="italic">we shall have it</hi>—according to our need. Our eyes spoke our thoughts &amp; feelings more than our tongues. I was warned, previously, not to talk too much, or stay too long; his hearing is <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, &amp; so is his sight, &amp; his powers of motion, handling, &amp;c. I must go again to see him in a day or two. But what am I to think of Townsend?—As for Mr Sidey—I never see him now. Mr Smalley calls occasionally &amp; so does Mr Parkin, Redstone’s successor.</p>
         <p>I have seen the offl. Report of 3 Commissrs.—Motley is the only one of P.G. Officers to be kept on for a time. What will become of Fannin? He <hi rend="italic">may </hi>get in for a County Board billett. Inspectors of Schools are to become Col. Govt. Officers: I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be too old: but the <hi rend="italic">Inspr. </hi>here, is to have ₤400. a year, &amp; travg. expenses ₤1. a day &amp; a secy. to Educn. Board, is to do the drudgery I have had to do. A remark is by them made, of <hi rend="italic">my doing all</hi>! I find that last year the Inspr. of Wgn. Schools had ₤400. a year &amp; travg. exps. ₤1. per diem &amp; ₤100. extra from Marlborough for going over to inspect the schools there—while the Secy. Edn. Board, Wgn., had, also, ₤400. It is rather <hi rend="italic">hard lines</hi>—that I should have had only, ₤100., or ₤150. (’75–’76), while another gets ₤400. for about <hi rend="italic">½ the</hi> duty. But, if I resign or am dismissed, I shall get something <hi rend="italic">now</hi> for loss of situation. The <hi rend="italic">Supers. </hi>are to have, <hi rend="italic">each</hi>, 2 years salary allowed them. There is to be an Edu. Board <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, (we must follow fashion) &amp; for the <hi rend="italic">1</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">st</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. one</hi> (only to last till February) Ormond, Chambers, Capt. Russell, &amp; Tanner, were to be the <hi rend="italic">Board</hi>.—</p>
         <p>In money matters things are dull: this continued fall in Wool has an ugly appearance—but it is what I always thought would, <hi rend="italic">must</hi>, come.—Capt. Newman sd. to me the other day (in his usual rapid way), If his son had only waited, he (Capt. N.) might have saved at least ₤1000. for the Estate, but it is always the way of those young fellows when they fall in love! (now, that is the sentence, but I know <hi rend="italic">nothing more </hi>and did not like to ask!)—</p>
         <p>A man named Gillice, a gardener from Tasmania to whom I had let J. Sutton’s house, &amp;c., bolted, cheating the rent. A man, named McKay—who came here last year from Dunedin with a <hi rend="italic">woman</hi>, w. <hi rend="italic">her 6 </hi>children, &amp; whom I had always supposed to be man &amp; wife, they have just fallen out &amp; separated &amp; cut &amp; run!—I had sold him, or <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">corner</hi> Sn. of T. Sn. 309, 92 ft. frontage @ ₤3. = ₤276.—&amp; she had pd. down ₤90. to pay remr. in 3 yrs., @ 10% int. He worked hard, &amp; fenced, &amp; put up a good house for a Butcher’s shop (his outlay near ₤250.) when being dogged to do so, I lent <hi rend="italic">them</hi> ₤100. P.N. @ 12 mths.,—I knew she was getting ₤12. a month, as rents from Dunedin. However, they are <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>! I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to lend (? give) the man a few pounds to help <hi rend="italic">him </hi>out: Neale advanced ₤35. to the woman, on her arguing over <hi rend="italic">all </hi>her rights, &amp;c., &amp; Margoliouth is Trustee—but they could not sell the Ho. &amp; premises—only ₤340. bid for it; while land is worth ₤4. a ft. I am right enough—but <hi rend="italic">no money</hi>. I was <hi rend="underline italic">obliged</hi> to trouble P.D. with a <hi rend="italic">very heavy acct</hi>., 3 weeks ago—with a request for <hi rend="italic">half</hi>! it alarmed them, but I have got <hi rend="italic">some</hi>—<hi rend="italic">less</hi> than a ¼th. From Sladen <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>. And J. Price gave me notice 3 days ago, that he could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> take up his 12 mths. P.N. due next month.</p>
         <p>Do not think I am unmindful of your inquiries <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Pukahu, &amp; Close, senr. I have been endeavouring—but with small success; I do not know whom to ask, &amp; not cause suspicion: if I could seee Wm. Marshall, I could know. However, I have ascertained that Cl. has left &amp; come to town to live, &amp; that the house is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> insured (w. Kennedy &amp; Co) in his, or in your name: but I hope to learn more shortly.</p>
         <p>Several houses building—on Wh. Road, on Thomas’ section, the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> of it now,—where the late fire took place:—on hills, near the “Elephant’s foot” hill,—<hi rend="italic">3 there</hi>, &amp; one near to Lyndon’s <hi rend="italic">old </hi>residence on the hill (in a nook) overlooking. Sealy let his Sns. well; ea about ½ ac. or so) put up <hi rend="italic">at </hi>₤300,—at <hi rend="italic">end </hi>of 14 yrs.—<hi rend="italic">to pay </hi>“6% <hi rend="italic">int</hi>.,” some brought 10 &amp; 11. </p>
         <p>I <hi rend="italic">suppose </hi>I shall have to put some of my land into Lyndon’s hands, but of all the buildings since you left—<hi rend="italic">your own houses </hi>most astonish me, or where they stood. Hamlin has made a grand entrance or rather, entrance<hi rend="underline">s</hi> for there are 2 roads now leading up, &amp; such a large house, &amp; the trees nearby all cleared away, with a stone wall terrace above—all looking well from the road, while just opposite is a row of <hi rend="underline italic">six</hi> good verandah cottages. And where “L. House” <hi rend="italic">stood</hi>—is a new <hi rend="italic">neat substantial</hi> house of <hi rend="italic">concrete</hi>; Neal &amp; Co’s. was higher than Morrison’s, McVay’s <hi rend="italic">new </hi>one, is higher than N.&amp; C., &amp; now this concrete is by far the highest of all—the best house in the whole row. While the “Masonic”—makes Tuxford’s look <hi rend="italic">very very small</hi>! Meat is <hi rend="italic">high</hi>; I pay 7d. for beef or 5d. for mutton. Hague retired, so his wife told me; through having to <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> so much! &amp; no money. I send you vol.viii. of our “Transactions N.Z. Institute”; am glad you continue a Member—for your Boys’ sake. My man’s wife not yet well; I am still obliged to <hi rend="italic">job</hi> indoors, &amp;c. I send a Report of J. Stuart’s trial: that mention of P.D’s. Bill—is awful! I knew all about that. It was only left as an accommodation B.—if P.D. <hi rend="italic">should </hi>want any, in England—&amp; P. got—none!</p>
         <p>My hand is sore &amp; aching, </p>
         <p>     &amp; so Good Bye, Believe me ever</p>
         <p>             Yours truly</p>

         <p>A. Luff, Esq.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>The big Steamer has been delayed at Port Chalmers, owing to the <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> gale, which rendered it impossible for her to cross the bar there—so <hi rend="italic">our </hi>mail has been delayed;—hope, however, it will get away <hi rend="italic">this time</hi>! The said Steamer <hi rend="italic">was</hi> to have been on her way hither, &amp; our mails closed before this, but she only got out of Pt Chalmers today!—</p>
         <p>And now I will add a little. Several <hi rend="italic">old </hi>Settlers have lately died. <hi rend="italic">Old </hi>Mrs Nairn at Pourerere, Mr Wilson, newspaper proprietor at Auckland—long a partner w. Williamson there. Mr Elliott, a Newspr. proprietor at Nelson, Mr Brittams at Canterbury, &amp;c. &amp;c–</p>
         <p>The “Bebington” arrd. at Auckland after 160 days!! &amp; 16 deaths! she was put under Quarantine: some of her immigrants are for H. Bay—A man named Craig was drowned at Clive during the time of flood 3 days ago;—Clive suffered most this time; &amp; Railway—in 2, 3, places,—for 2–3 days traffic suspended.—I hear that Col. Whitmore’s garden &amp; grounds suffered largely.—</p>
         <p>Wilson of Canterbury, Alley’s <hi rend="italic">pseudo </hi>friend, has been made to <hi rend="italic">smart</hi>—at last. See, the statement in papers.—</p>
         <p>In talking w. Capt. Newman, I find that it is his son <hi rend="italic">Bruce</hi>—&amp; that the estate is in <hi rend="italic">Pov. Bay.</hi>—purchased from <hi rend="italic">Natives</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">fair one</hi> I don’t yet know.</p>
         <p>H.R.R. has acted shamefully towards poor Sladen! S. sought a paddock for his sheep, &amp; engaged w. H. Tomoana, so they were <hi rend="italic">there</hi> repasturing: now Karaitiana was at Wgn., &amp; their ground had not yet been marked off—what did H.R.R. do, but send Sladen’s sheep all to the Pound at Hastings; Kinross told me, it cost Sladen more than ₤20. in Pound fees!!—</p>
         <p>Drower (&amp; others) inland, also crying-out against H.R.R. loudly;—what will the <hi rend="italic">end be</hi>? &amp; <hi rend="italic">when</hi>?</p>
         <p>The Crew of the Coq.—cannot get their wages! The Capt. telegraphed to Owners in Newcastle,—they will not respond. Fortunately a good subsn. has been got up for them. One of the young sailors (a very nice looking yg. fellow, &amp; teetotaller) came <hi rend="italic">here</hi> to look for Willie—they were fellow-seamen in the “Merope,” &amp; in the same watch.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Tonight</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> of the real fight in Ho. of Reps.—it may last a fortnight!—<hi rend="italic">Our</hi> Railway has <hi rend="italic">much more </hi>than paid its keep.</p>
         <p>Weber had a very nasty kick from his horse (in the lower belly,)—he is just moving out again.—</p>
         <p>Both “Kiwi” &amp; “Rangatira” returned to Napier yesterday, but no line to me from Rhodes—perhaps none was required.— I <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> that Close’s son is residing in the father’s house at Pukahu, but I’ll seek to learn more yet.— Fannin’s eldest daughter, Ada, was married, a <hi rend="italic">short time</hi> ago, to a <hi rend="italic">very young </hi>fellow named Bone, living at Witherow’s: she has a child. Poor F. seems much cut up! what with one thing and another! <hi rend="italic">this year </hi>has been a trying one to him.—I <hi rend="italic">hope </hi>he will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> seek solace in the bottle.—</p>
         <p>     Good bye—again</p>
         <p>             Bel. me ever yours</p>

         <p>Saturday 29. I seal &amp; send off, not being able to crawl out myself—last Saturday’s wetting has laid me up for a season here. W.C.</p>
