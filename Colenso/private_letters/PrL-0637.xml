         <p rend="end">Napier, Nov. 30/86.</p>
         <p>Mr. D.P. Balfour,<lb/>Glenross.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yesterday I was going to write to you—but just as I took up my pen to do so, it came into my mind, that your Mail hence only left on <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> morning, &amp; so I dropped tools.</p>
         <p>Last night 9 p.m., while writing to England, my man came from P.O. bringing a little tin box <hi rend="italic">from you</hi>! I had to take out its contents on to a dinner plate, &amp; sprinkle, &amp;c., &amp; leave till this morning, and now I have gone over them.</p>
         <p>But, first, (&amp; in due order,) your kind letter of the 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. which I duly received. And now thank you for:—the bit of Moss in it was of our <hi rend="italic">Mnium,</hi> rather old, but your specimens of to-day have filled up the gap. I find it is a <hi rend="italic">different</hi> species (just as I had expected) from Mr. Hill’s collected at Tarawera, (road to Taupo) a few weeks ago.—I was pleased to find you were getting on well with your shearing, &amp; I suppose you are, by this time, drawing to a close. Yesterday in town, I saw Campbell of Poukawa who told me he had <hi rend="italic">finished</hi>:—some, I fancy? who began late, may have been hindered by our late rains (which still continue), but then they have <hi rend="italic">feed</hi> &amp; grass <hi rend="italic">seed</hi>—“Galore”!</p>
         <p>You mentioned the death of my old aquaintance T. Shirley, &amp; of his <hi rend="italic">long</hi> residence in this district. He was one of <hi rend="italic">our</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">early</hi> settlers, but that was a <hi rend="italic">gross</hi> mistake in “Herald” (45 years in this Dist.!!) I wrote immediately to Editor (a private note) calling his attention to it, from 30 to 32, or so, yrs. would be nearer the mark, but perhaps not as long as that <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>
         <p>I saw mention of it in an Auckland paper, where it was given, “45 years in N.Z.”, this perhaps is correct.</p>
         <p>I hope young Parsons is getting better, &amp; being so <hi rend="italic">young</hi> that he may wholly overcome <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> outlive the disorder, as it is an unpleasant affection. I have seen a little of it.</p>
         <p>In this <hi rend="italic">last</hi> lot of mosses, there is little of any consequence, I have washed up, this mg. &amp; set aside 4 sorts, but no novelty. I will tell you more about them, &amp; other mosses, too, by-and-by—when I take up that tribe. There were a <hi rend="italic">few fruit stalks</hi> (apparently pulled out of their leafing stems) of a <hi rend="italic">long green-podded</hi> moss, I should like more of that by-and-by when <hi rend="italic">ripe</hi>—these are too young although I beleive I know it <hi rend="italic">well</hi>.</p>
         <p>Yesterday, 3 p.m. we <hi rend="italic">had</hi> rain! with thunder &amp; lightning!! quite awful, tropical. It frightened the “auld wifie” here, &amp; <hi rend="italic">elated</hi> me, sky-high! <hi rend="italic">I always rejoice at such times with a most exuberant overflow of spirits. (I am also, at sea, in a gale, or storm</hi>).</p>
         <p>However the thunder, &amp;c. was <hi rend="italic">so close overhead</hi> that I went out on the hill for safety, quite expecting to see one of the trees (a Pinus insignis), or the chimney-pot struck—but, strange to say, a low chimney on <hi rend="italic">the other side</hi> of Milton Road, directly opposite was tumbled down! but I am not sure it was actually <hi rend="italic">struck</hi> by lightning, rather, perhaps from the shaking &amp; the <hi rend="italic">deluging</hi> rain—for it was built up without good mortar.—The lightning was really blinding here in my front room, &amp; quite dazed me.</p>
         <p>Have you any starlings or Mina birds building and breeding about you yet?</p>
         <p>They are here, &amp; doing great good. It is pretty to see them in the field.</p>
         <p>I don’t think you will have anything new in the <hi rend="italic">Moss</hi> way about you. You must go farther &amp; higher, inland; there are however, in <hi rend="italic">some</hi> springs and streamlets, some <hi rend="italic">water-mosses</hi>. These may turn out new if you should have any.</p>
         <p>I am pretty (or <hi rend="italic">very</hi>) well again. A great change with me, for the better took place on Sunday last, &amp; yesterday; <hi rend="italic">Electricity</hi> clinched the nail. I have for 50 years been a great believer in electricity,—&amp; am of the opinion, that future ages will make wondrous uses of it, &amp; also find it a <hi rend="italic">great curative</hi> power. I should like to go off to the Woods &amp; glens again! “My heart is in the Highlands!”—but that I cannot go till after the holidays—say mid. Jany.</p>
         <p>Great preparations are being made for Ct. Sg this evening.—I am not in favour of that move: too <hi rend="italic">much frivolity</hi>! Waste of precious time!! Music, balls, concerts, theatres, races, &amp;c., &amp;c.—and <hi rend="italic">no study of Nature—nothing</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">solid</hi>. A fellow cannot live upon <hi rend="italic">flower</hi> although lovely!!!!</p>
         <p>So, Goodbye, and with kind regards to all the Balfour clan at Glenross, beleive me, Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                             W. Colenso.</p>
