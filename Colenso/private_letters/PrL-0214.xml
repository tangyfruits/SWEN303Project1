         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Enclosed I send you part of a letter I have lately recd. From Mr. Thomas Kirk of Auckland, the owner of the Brit. Plants I wrote to you about.—You will see what he says: please <hi rend="italic">return me his letter</hi>, my hand will not allow of my transcribing: I write this in pain &amp; w. difficulty.</p>
         <p>Last mo. <hi rend="italic">While in great agony</hi>, I got a friend to write to you a note, which I dictated: it was written in a hurry, as well as pain, &amp; I scarcely know what I said, but I hope nothing wrong.</p>
         <p>My hand, as you may see, is still of <hi rend="underline italic">little</hi> use: my forefinger is rigid, &amp;c.—and I may never have the use of it again. If so, this will necessarily cause an entire revolution in all my plans. I hope you are well. I have suffered a great deal but am now free from much pain. Believe me,</p>
         <p>Ever yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
