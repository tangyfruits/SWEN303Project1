         <p>Dannevirke<lb/>June 17. 1897.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>I have lately received two good letters from you of the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> and 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst. hearty thanks for both. I was a little surprised to hear of your cousin Rechab’s death mainly however to his having only the week before written two letters on Romney marsh sheep &amp; their wool to the “Herald” closing with “he was ready to give more information.” I suppose you know young Jones of Waipukurau who died the day after. I knew him also well a heavy loss to the Waipukurau District. I notice in the paper an advt. in the “Herald” for a gardener at Mt. Vernon apply Jno. Harding. I daresay Mr John Harding feels his loss acutely. I left Woodville on the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> inst. after 63 days confinement, put on clothes for the first time to come away, C.Baddeley kindly coming to bring me on to this place. You may imagine I came hither <hi rend="italic">very weak indeed</hi> and at first had some difficulty in managing without assistance having been so long coddled by my kind nurse, the weather there too being very severe throughout all May here; on my arrival it was fine and I began to take outdoor exercise at once. I am sorry to say this has been stopped owing to change of weather to constant rain mild and no wind during the last six days which has confined me to my little room and thrown me back considerably. Soltan is here in all his glory and I am sorry to say even supported by the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and also by Archdeacon S.W. although the Bishop would not countenance him nor grant him a licence. Of course the Salvation Army &amp; the Methodists &amp;c so join so all hands just now in full swing which will of course last until the hallucination or hypnotism is past. I suppose you have heard of Mr. York’s pulpit statement and seen letters thereby evoked. Did you notice my letter in the “Herald” of last week<note xml:id="ftn3-830" place="foot" n="830"> The record reign. <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 8 June 1897.</note> with Walker’s omission and subsequent apology; his omission, small though it was, <hi rend="italic">caused me some bother and trouble which you can guess</hi>; in the Woodville “Examr.” of yesterday was another short letter of mine which you can look up. Last week I received a paper from Mr. A. Luff (“Post” of 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) containing a long account of the Caroline Islands &amp;c, the author whom I suppose to be an American after less than two years knocking about seems to know all about the origin of the Maoris!!! I have also received from Gore a copy of your “Proceedings” containing much interesting matter but as usual several mistakes re old Maori matters, years ago published in the eralier vols. by Kirk &amp; Co.—viz. <hi rend="italic">the mistakes</hi>. Early in April I recd. from Government printer proofs of Mao. Lex: I was obliged to tell Mackay of my situation and little chance of my doing anything for some months. I received a very nice reply, on my arrival here. I recd. <hi rend="italic">another </hi>and a <hi rend="italic">first </hi>proof &amp;c and as I determined to remain here for this month I turned to with a will and with no small difficulty have corrected both &amp; sent them in hope they will make out my writing. I admire your little booklet Hebrew version of Church Service for 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I have recd. from Govt. P.O. five copies of the Mao. Vern. of the Ch. of E. service for that day, a very kind letter to hand from Sir. Jas. Hector and Gore.</p>
         <p>Mr. Fannin’s son kindly writes this for me just as Mr. Holden did at Woodville, rather a curious coincidence in these two towns the sons of <hi rend="italic">old </hi>friends so readily helping me in my extremity, both too being professional chemists!</p>
         <p>Now my good friend I must say Good bye. I trust you will see that you are indebted to Mr. Fannin more than to me for this letter &amp; with very kind regards to you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> &amp; best wishes believe me ever</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,                W. Colenso.<lb/>                                                                        p R.S.F.</p>
