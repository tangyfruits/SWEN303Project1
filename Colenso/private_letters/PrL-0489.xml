         </p>
         <p>a copy of your Ferns &amp;c. I sat up to run through it:—and to tell you the truth, I felt————well, surprised, &amp; wish you had never published it in that form; for, <hi rend="italic">as I view it</hi>, it contains much of error, particularly Chap. III. I should not thus venture to write plainly to you (if indeed, at all,) were you in the position of a <hi rend="italic">private</hi> writer, or publisher of such a work, but it is because of your high position of “Science Teacher” in your “High Schools,” and the Editor (at least) of your new Journal of Science! Alas! say I, for the rising generation, if such <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Ferns, &amp; our N.Z. Ferns in particular, is what they are to be taught. The “Set Up” of your book is on the whole excellent for a Colonial work (barring a few figures in the plates): but your rude demolishing of species, which your predescessors, all able European Pteridologists of fame—had so patiently reared and supported after much examination of ample materials is to me unaccountable, and done too, I fear, without any fair authority on your part—of extensive Fern Library and Herbaria, &amp; long experience &amp; study in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> matters; in fact, I am led to believe, that had you this <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> experience you would not have committed yourself to the publication of this work in its present guise. You profess to be guided by Sir W. Hooker’s “Species Filicum” &amp; by his &amp; Baker’s Synopsis Filicum, but in many instances you wholly abandon them your guides! I very much fear you have been led to look too much to Mr. Kirk, indeed, throughout your Book he is your main “authority”! And here I may remark that did not your Book prominently bear your name, I could almost affirm it was written by Kirk, for I detect much of his (besides the <hi rend="italic">numerous</hi> quotations) throughout.—And here, permit me to observe, (as we are comparatively strangers) that my whole life—particularly these last 30 years,—has been spent in an eager search after <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>: whether in Religious, Ecclesiastical, Social and Natural Science, (as you yourself must have occasionally seen in the pages of the “Transactions N.Z.I.” I have not spared even my best &amp; oldest friends mistakes) but then, in doing so, I have showed where, &amp; sometimes, how, they have existed, although such has often taken me a very long time, both in the study &amp; in research and in the writing. Had you published a work on your favourite pursuit &amp; study (our N.Z. crustaceans)—in which I have with much pleasure seen you were at home &amp; a master, I should have accepted all you would have said with pleasure; but in your taking up this peculiar one of Ferns,—&amp; our N.Z. Ferns, too—I as an old &amp; diligent Fern student of 50 years, easily detect wherein you are wrong,—&amp; hence I write. Having said thus much, it behoves me to give you a few instances (out of many) but I must be brief.</p>
         <p>I. Valid old established species rejected.</p>
         <p>Page 35. Hymenophyllum <hi rend="italic">Tunbridgense </hi>&amp; H. <hi rend="italic">unilaterale</hi>—2 very distinct species, repeatedly affirmed by all Botanists of any note, from Sir W. Hooker, down to the latest,——</p>
         <p>Page 31. <hi rend="italic">Dicksonia fibrosa</hi>, affirmed by Sir W. Hooker, J. Smith, (Kew) Baker, &amp; others. Here, also, in N.Z. in Gardens.—Mr. Tiffen’s Fernery, Napier,—the Australian fern (<hi rend="italic">Dicksonia antarctica</hi>) of large size, imported, is growing together with the N.Z. Fern D. fibrosa; &amp; himself &amp; gardener &amp; visitors, all marvel at its ever having been confounded with the N.Z. one: so, also, Mr. Armstrong of Christchurch (Transactions Vol.xiii. p. 360.) It has no affinity whatever with D. <hi rend="italic">squarrosa</hi>, with which species you have lumped it.</p>
         <p>Page 79. <hi rend="italic">Polypodium sylvaticum</hi>—repeatedly affirmed and published by all Botanists (Sir W Hooker, Dr Jos Hooker, Mr J Smith, &amp;c.) as a good &amp; proper species, you have also lumped with an <hi rend="italic">Aspidium</hi>! from which it is genuinely distinct.—</p>
         <p>II. Of my newly described species in the Transactions N.Z. Vols.—–</p>
         <p>I may say of all these, that I did not expect you to quote them as truly valid <hi rend="italic">species</hi>, they being unknown to you save from my descriptions. You might, however (seeing they were all N.Z. plants) have courteously mentioned them as having been recently discovered, by me, &amp; so have placed them in their proper places (or at the end) of their respective genera, as such,—or (at least) as varieties—(but with a ?) as Sir W Hooker did with many of his (Species Filicum). These, however, will hereafter—as in <hi rend="italic">Lindsæa viridis, Dicksonia fibrosa</hi>, &amp;c.,—speak for themselves. For instance you may say of <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium ramulosum</hi>,—“<hi rend="underline italic">I do not know of it</hi>; and yet you quote Kirk’s whole description of it from the “Transactions” and give it as a valid species, &amp;c.——But you do make me say something ridiculous which I had never said; e.g. </p>
         <p>Page 92.—<hi rend="italic">Gymnogramma poroi</hi>,—It was, originally, found by Colenso on cliffs <hi rend="italic">near </hi>(sic) Cook’s Strait! Where did I ever state this?</p>
         <p>Page 92. <hi rend="italic">Gymnogramma leptophylla</hi>: syn Grammatis <hi rend="italic">N.Z.</hi>;<hi rend="italic"> </hi>Colenso. I never described this fern as a <hi rend="italic">Grammatis</hi>, &amp; that Kirk knows, as I gave him a copy (author’s copy) of my early published N.Z. Ferns, see my <hi rend="italic">note</hi> Transactions N.Z.I. Vol.xiii, p.373: which I think you also must have seen.</p>
         <p>III. Other errors, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Page 27. <hi rend="italic">Gleichenia dichotoma</hi>:—you say Mr Kirk has pointed out that probably Forster gathered it at some isolated locality in the Bay of Plenty or Poverty Bay:—How could Forster have done so when he was never in the N. Island?—</p>
         <p>P.36. <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllum minimum</hi>.—you say as quotations in the N. Island, in the neighbourhood of Cook’s Straits (!!!)—and, also,— “partial to shaded rocks near the sea”.—Whence these two quotations? Have you ever seen <hi rend="italic">H. minimum </hi>vera?</p>
         <p>P.61. <hi rend="italic">Pteris macilenta </hi>was <hi rend="italic">not </hi>discovered by A. Cunningham.</p>
         <p>P.82. <hi rend="italic">Nephrodium decompositum</hi>: My <hi rend="italic">N. pentangularum </hi>is quite distinct, &amp; so I informed Kirk in a letter.</p>
         <p>P.82. Under <hi rend="italic">Nephrodium glabellum</hi>,—you say—Botanists are indebted to Mr Kirk, for clearing up the confusion &amp;c—; I do not see this. A Cunningham had published his Ferns clearly enough (which Kirk also knew,) and I had specimens of both species—(<hi rend="italic">N. decompositum </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">N. flabellum</hi>)—while A Cunningham was yet with me.</p>
         <p>P.51. Similar language re Kirk is again used under <hi rend="italic">Lindsæa viridis</hi>: &amp; again I say, I don’t see it; for like A Cunningham, I had published my Ferns clearly enough, &amp; it was only a work of time, &amp; all would be righted.</p>
         <p>P.123. <hi rend="italic">Comans</hi>— “hairy, covered with hairs” (sic!) Would Forster, a good classical scholar, have so defined the specific name of his very smooth, shining, hairless, glabrous plant?</p>
         <p>P.62. Further, <hi rend="italic">Pteris comans</hi>, is <hi rend="italic">not Pt. Endlicheriana </hi>and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, (as Sir W. Hooker says in his Species Filicum). I have seen both plants.</p>
         <p>P.123. <hi rend="italic">Cunninghamii</hi>—in honour of A Cunningham an eminent Australian Botanist, &amp;c. No N.Z. plant was <hi rend="italic">so</hi> named, but on the contrary from the two Brothers (especially Allan) having discovered so much in <hi rend="italic">N. Zealand</hi>—which A Cunningham also published. Besides, I should not call an English Botanist an “Australian” one merely because he botanized in that country.—This, however, would scarcely be worth noticing had you not, just after, said so much about Kirk. What could Mr Kirk have known of N.Z. Botany <hi rend="italic">without </hi>Cunningham’s Precursor of N.Z. Plants? &amp; Dr Hooker’s handbook of N.Z. Flora?</p>
         <p>And now to the conclusion.—On the whole, and only after much consideration, I have deemed it best <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to send you the Ruahine Journey MSS. for your new serial; also, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to write for it a <hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi> of <hi rend="italic">A. Cunningham</hi> as intended. We seem so diametrically opposed in our Botanical views, &amp;c, that I think I had better keep out of your arena altogether; because you there (and your Botanical authority Mr. Kirk) will have as a matter of course, to supplement &amp; back up your publication for your students; &amp; I have no desire to be either tacitly passing by or always correcting of error. Besides I have painfully known what it is to write against an Editor in his own paper. At the same time I confess, it has grieved me not a little to be obliged to come to this decision, re the above papers, &amp; I shall have much to do with my friends here, I know, but I see at present no other honourable alternative (I wish I could) for there are passages in my MSS. which bear directly on some of your great alterations and you could not (perhaps) well insert them &amp; I would not allow of their being struck out or modified; as I have had a little too long experience among our N.Z. Ferns &amp;c &amp;c to think of this. You, I know, will not (<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>) be pleased with my present letter; believe me, it has been an irksome task to me to write it, but I am borne up in believing that I have only attempted honestly and plainly to perform a duty—and duties are frequently unpleasant—and to write upon a subject I think I fully understand.</p>
         <p>     I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>             Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>                     Wm. Colenso.<note xml:id="ftn3-129" place="foot" n="129"> The letter is annotated by Hocken, “The above is a good specimen of Colenso’s nasty, bitter way in criticism. He was a jealous man &amp; was loth to allow that any one in N.Z. knew much about N.Z. botany but himself. G.M. Thomson is an uncommonly good &amp; trustworthy scientific man. T.M.H.”</note>
