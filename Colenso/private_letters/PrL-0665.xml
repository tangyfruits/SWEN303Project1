         <p rend="end">NAPIER FRIDAY NIGHT<lb/>JUNE 8/88</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour<lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your letter (long overdue), with accompanying packet, I found here on my return from Bush, last Sat, 2nd instant. I had gone again to the Bush on 10th of April—so, made a long stay this time—mainly owing to the continuance of <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> weather <hi rend="italic">there</hi>—which began early in April. I was shut up <hi rend="italic">many</hi> days, but fortunately had <hi rend="italic">lots</hi> of writing to do, (127 letters—some <hi rend="italic">very long</hi>), so that my time was fully <hi rend="italic">occupied</hi>, just as it is here. I <hi rend="italic">love</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, and cannot exist without it. My being there at Dannevirke, and only just arrived) and disliking Railway travelling, kept me from appearing at Renatas feast,—and funeral. I suppose you saw my 2–3 letters,—written from Dannevirke, that appeared in the “Herald”.<note xml:id="ftn3-391" place="foot" n="391"> The late Renata Kawepo. <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 18 April 1888. The Infidel and the Orthodox Man. <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 15 May 1888.</note> I gained a few nice things while there, among them a <hi rend="italic">few</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">new</hi> ones, but what particularly pleased me, was my finding a fern that I <hi rend="italic">long sought</hi> diligently, butin vain:—it was discovered by Forster (<hi rend="italic">vide</hi> Cook, 2nd voyage) and I have had a few poor small broken bits sent to me from the S, but <hi rend="italic">I never saw it growing before,—Trichomanes humile.</hi> I will enclose a specimen.</p>
         <p>I came away very unwillingly, for I would rather be there than here, though I wanted my books, &amp;c, &amp; have business matters to attend to. I was <hi rend="italic">very cold</hi>, too, there, indeed our <hi rend="italic">coldest</hi> days were in April—<hi rend="italic">ice</hi> on ground, pools, &amp;c. I had no fire the whole time, &amp; so escaped “catching cold” in lungs. While there I was busy drawing up addresses (as Pre­sident) for next Monday night, when I hope I will be well enough to get through it. I have been laid up <hi rend="italic">here</hi> since my return, severe Rheumatism—half Sciatica—brought on by entering this <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> &amp; cold house, in which the precious caretakers never lit a fire!. Had you written to me (young man) you too, would have had a letter from Dannevirke.</p>
         <p>You ought to be finding some nice Mosses &amp; Hepaticæ soon; to be followed by Spring Orchids—Keep your weather-eye <hi rend="italic">open.</hi> You seem to have had lots of visitors; hope <hi rend="italic">everything</hi> was <hi rend="italic">agreeable</hi>. I am sorry to hear this account of your eyes:—they may still come round. I do not think “old age” (as you say) has anything to do with it—for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are not old. I am, and don’t use glasses.</p>
         <p>The spec sent is merely a diseased branch of <hi rend="italic">Clianthus</hi>—I have seen plenty on other shrubs &amp; small trees; it is caused by a small fly puncturing &amp; laying eggs—in the wood; it is however very curious; I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> show it on My. night. I write now to you, as I shall not have any time next wk to do so—that being Eng Mail week.</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p rend="end">TUESDAY mg.</p>
         <p>I showed your spcn of <hi rend="italic">Clianthus</hi> last night at our meeting­—it caused much interest &amp; lots of questions. If you can manage do send me 1, or 2, more of the <hi rend="italic">large</hi> spcms you speak of, safely packed in a box—I paying all outlay—to show at our next meeting (2nd Monday in July).</p>
         <p>I will thank you if to hand a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> days <hi rend="italic">before</hi> only—so much the better—as then they would be <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>, &amp; they don’t keep well.</p>
         <p>I got back very tired at x. 45;</p>
         <p>Excuse this</p>
         <p>W.C.</p>
