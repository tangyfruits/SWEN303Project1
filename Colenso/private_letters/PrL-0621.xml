         <p rend="end">MONDAY EVENING<lb/>8th Feby 1886</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour <lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>We have at Home (in my part of the Old Country) a saying “½ a loaf is better than no bread.” If you believe it, then welcome a <hi rend="italic">much</hi> shorter note than usual from an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> acquaintance.</p>
         <p>Yours of the 16th Jan, I received on the 20th, but have not found time to answer. I did not expect anything from you in the midst of the summer, &amp; am really glad I got nothing—for some plants that Hill &amp; Ham­ilton kindly brought me from the heights (interior) I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been able to attend to—the small crypts however will keep.</p>
         <p>My heavy job (promised in Jan) is still in hand; another fortnight I hope will see it <hi rend="italic">off</hi>, &amp; me <hi rend="italic">free</hi>. I wrote to Gov informing them.</p>
         <p>Of course you saw the <hi rend="italic">wretched</hi> meagre report of our annual meeting. Only <hi rend="italic">few</hi> present, still it was a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> one (and I thought interesting). I was <hi rend="italic">obliged to have a good deal to say</hi>—and <hi rend="italic">we did</hi> not break up till XII. How things will get on in 86 time will show.</p>
         <p>I hope you are well &amp; all at Glenross—I am tolerably so. Have not seen P.D. this year;</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. If I can I hope to go to Bush &amp; Woodville at end of this mo.</p>
