         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>January 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1897.</p>
         <p>Dear Hans </p>
         <p>I must no longer put off writing to you—if only to thank you for your kind and full letter of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. December, which was re-addressed to me at Dannevirke: I was pleased to find you were all well, in health, and had finished your shearing and was getting on with your haymaking, which, I suppose, is also all over by this time.—</p>
         <p>I was also glad to know that Axel had written to you and that he too was doing well—this is good news.</p>
         <p>I went to the Bush on the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. December, and returned on the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. I think I sent you a Xmas. card—but am not sure (I sent so many), just to let you know—<hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> were </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> forgotten</hi>. I am<hi rend="italic">much </hi>better than I was when I went to the Bush, and came back sooner than I had intended, to help the Minister here at St. Augustine’s (who is unwell): I preached there last Sunday. I do, and ever shall, dear Hans, help <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi> (and many others) in my poor way, in my prayers—this is our <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>, and our <hi rend="italic">privilege </hi>as Christians: I often fear for <hi rend="italic">Norsewood</hi>, as being like Athens of old, “too <hi rend="italic">superstitious</hi>”, every wretched low miserable sect seem to gain footing <hi rend="underline italic">there</hi>.</p>
         <p>Kind regards to <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi>—including your dear father-in-law</p>
         <p>         And believe me—</p>
         <p>                         Yours always truly</p>
         <p>                                         W. Colenso.</p>
