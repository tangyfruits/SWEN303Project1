         <p rend="end">Hawkes Bay, Jany. 12/46</p>
         <p>His Honor<lb/>Major Richmond<lb/>      &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c<lb/>Wellington.</p>
         <p>My dear Major Richmond,</p>
         <p>I hasten to avail myself of an opportunity afforded me by a Native going to Wairarapa, to inform Your Honor of an unpleasant affair which took place here a few days ago, between some of the Heathen Natives of this neighbourhood and some whites.—</p>
         <p>On the morning of the 31st. ult., a Cutter, which proved to be the Royal William, was seen making apparently for the Station, she stood in for the shore, and tacked 2 or 3 times, when I sent a canoe off to her. Before however the Canoe could reach her, a Letter was brought me by a Native (who, with some others, had been early on board in another Canoe, while we were at morning prayer &amp; School, which proved to be a memorandum of few packages of goods shipped for me at Poverty Bay. Shortly after this, the Canoe which I had sent returned, bringing the Goods and informing me, that the vessel was come to trade, and was therefore about to be piloted into the harbour (Ahuriri), about 7 miles distant, NNW. The next day—the 1st instant, about 9, p.m., a Christian Native (whom I had sent to the vessel, to take a letter from the Bishop to Mr. Cole, &amp; to pay for the freight of the goods which had been landed) returned, saying, that the Master of the vessel had been very angry with the Natives, and had refused to trade, &amp;c, &amp;c.—and that he did not know the cause of his so acting. The next day, early, I heard, that the Cutter had gone to sea; and that on a Canoe following her to offer pigs &amp; potatoes for sale, the Master seized and presented a double-barrelled gun, loaded &amp; cocked, and swore that he would shoot them if they came near. One of them, however, boarded her, grappled with &amp; threw down the Captain—wrenched the gun from him—tied his hands, &amp; made the Crew to come to anchor. The Captain now begged hard to be released, promising to reward them handsomely; on which they untied him &amp; he gave them several articles. The Bishop, who happened to be here at the time, together with myself endeavoured to elicit the whole truth, and to get back the property thus obtained, and which I hope we have succeeded in doing. From what further information we obtained, it appears, that the young chief (of first rank) who piloted the vessel into Ahuriri, having found a large piece of pounamu (Jade, or Axe-stone,) on board for sale, wished to have it, and to pay the price, 12 pigs and, there being but one piece, he did not like to quit sight of it, fearing lest some other Chief should in a little while come on board &amp; get it; he, therefore, desired it to be left on deck, which the Captain refused to permit. An altercation ensued; the Master ordered his men to take it below, the Chief told them not to do so, and, though he was alone on board, they (4 in no.) being intimidated did not obey the Captain, on which he said, they had better all go on shore together, since they would not obey him, which they prepared to do. This was in the evening in the harbour. The next morning, the vessel went out, and was soon followed by a Canoe, in which were 6 natives. As they neared her the Captain ordered them off, and dared his men to throw them a rope (which some one of them was about to do); on which the Natives in the Canoe caught hold of a rope hanging over the stern, and held on by it; this being perceived by the Captain, he came aft, swearing and presenting his gun, as before related; the Natives, at first, cowed down into the bottom of their Canoe, when suddenly one more bold than the rest, leaped up, knocked the gun upwards out of the Captains hand, seizing him by the hair of his head, and holding on and the Canoe parting at the same time he got up into the vessel; there he first bound the Captain’s hands, and then discharging the gun into the air, ordered, in broken English, the Crew to let go the anchor, which they did.—After which the property was given out by the Captain on his being released, as before described. The vessel left that same day, and where she went to I do not know; perhaps to Wellington, or back to Poverty Bay.</p>
         <p>The property we have received is as follows:—one double-barrelled Gun, 2 pieces Calico, about 3 pieces of printed Cotton, 3 Cotton rugs, 2 Blue Serge Shirts, 3 Check Shirts, 1 Straw Bonnet, 1 Gambroon Coat, 3 Cotton Handkerchiefs, &amp; 6 Red worsted Caps, and 1 Sovereign (in gold) which I had sent to the Captain, as his demand for freight.—</p>
         <p>The Note, which I have the honor to enclose, the Bishop wrote before he left—which he did on the 5th. inst.,—and I think I may safely add, that, from what I can learn, no attack of any kind was ever once thought of by the Natives—the bare fact of their going unarmed and only 6 in no. sufficiently proves this. They think themselves grossly ill-used in the matter: firstly, in being cursed; and secondly, in being threatened with death in the manner they were: both being offences, which, I scarcely need say, are of the very highest kind among themselves.</p>
         <p>I believe the above list contains the whole of the property given out on the occasion. I will thank Your Honor to let me know, by some early opportunity, what I shall do with the Goods in my possession. Perhaps, I may be allowed to remark, that those Natives had nothing whatever to do with the robbing of the U.S. Brig “Falco.” They even refused to take any part of the property stolen from that vessel, when it was subsequently offered them by their friends and relations living on the spot. And, further, I have this day heard, from a white man residing in the neighbour-hood, that it has long been a practice with the person in command of the “Royal William,” not only to take up arms against Natives, but against whites also.—</p>
         <p>In consequence of a Letter which I wrote and left for the Bishop at Wairarapa, his Lordship called on the different Settlers in that valley, to ascertain the amount of their charges against me. I trust now their fears (at least), will have subsided. I intend to call upon them in March next, on my return from Wellington. The Letter which you mentioned to me, as having written to me, I have not received.—</p>
         <p>                       I am, with Every respect</p>
         <p>                       Your Honor’s most ob. Servt.</p>
         <p>                               W. Colenso.</p>
