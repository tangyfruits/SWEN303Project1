         <p rend="end">Napier, March 18th</p>
         <p>Dear Sir George Grey</p>
         <p>The letter accompanying this has been delayed here—nearly a month! For, on my going to the P. Off. in Feby., I casually heard from Mr. Henry Russell &amp; others that you were daily expected here, &amp; at that very time were supposed to be on your way: this is the reason.</p>
         <p>Two steamers arriving yesterday from Auckland without you (and two others leaving <hi rend="italic">for </hi>Auckland to day)—I now forward it.</p>
         <p>Sincerely hoping that your delay in visiting Napier has not been caused by illness.</p>
         <p>I am (in haste)</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
