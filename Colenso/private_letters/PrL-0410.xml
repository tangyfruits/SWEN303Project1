         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>April 2, 1880.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I won’t attempt to tell you how glad I was to see your packet, and to receive a letter from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. Coming, too, as they did, at a time when Mr. Gore was enquiring by telegram,— “If I had recd.” &amp;c.,—which then I had not! I had heard from Dr Bastian of your being down South, and I fancy he would have liked to see you <hi rend="italic">and the Bell</hi> at Wellington; he had made sure the latter was <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. I don’t think Dr. B. was over much pleased with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> (more anon).</p>
         <p>Now to business.—<lb/>Your printed sheets kindly sent for<hi rend="italic">errata</hi> (which I now return enclosed): you will be pleased to hear of none, or scarcely any, nothing of importance (as far as I know <hi rend="italic">not</hi> having the copy to refer to). I am particularly pleased at all the <hi rend="italic">Maori</hi> (and there was a large share of it) being correct,—I had scarcely hoped for this, though I had striven to write plainly. The whole is very well executed, and reflects no small credit on Printer, corrector, &amp; Editor. You will see the few small errors I have marked; there is one other (2 or 3 <hi rend="italic">s</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">together</hi> in a word, which caught my eye on <hi rend="italic">first </hi>opening, but has eluded my search since!—I cannot understand those in the Lat. quot. from Virgil, and suppose, (<hi rend="italic">If they are so in </hi>the Tasm. Jl.,) that they must have been altered in Tasmania,—as I could not have <hi rend="italic">so</hi> copied from my own old book of my student’s days;—and what makes me more inclined to think so is, their accents &amp; marks, which are not in my copy (a rather large edition of Heynius), and they seem to me as if copied from a <hi rend="italic">smaller school </hi>edition,—as v<hi rend="underline">u</hi>lnus for v<hi rend="underline">o</hi>ln., &amp; a<hi rend="underline">cc</hi>ingio for a<hi rend="underline">dc</hi>ing., are the more modern though correct; the 2 <hi rend="underline">ts</hi> in <hi rend="italic">litora </hi>and the <hi rend="underline">æ</hi> for <hi rend="underline">œ</hi> are undoubtedly errors; but you may (<hi rend="italic">there</hi>) be able easily to refer to a modern ed. of V., also to the Tasm. Journal itself: most of them, if any, are not worth mentioning in an errata. I have also verified nearly every one of the references (save those of Tasm. Jl.) and they are correct.</p>
         <p>There is however one <hi rend="italic">very stupid </hi>error of <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> (for which I deserve a flogging, <hi rend="underline italic">&amp;c.</hi>) viz. <hi rend="italic">in the “</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">Report</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">” </hi>I sent you of our Branch, in which the lizard is called N. <hi rend="italic">hexagonalis </hi>instead of N. <hi rend="italic">pentag.</hi>!! and I never knew of it until now that I saw your printed sheets! Please have the little <hi rend="italic">Abstract of Proceedings </hi>narrowly looked at, just to see whether it is correct therein, and if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> please <hi rend="italic">alter it.</hi> That error is to be accounted for this way:—the clean read Ms. had been dispatched to you, and then, long afterwards, when I had to draw up the “Abstract”, and the “Report”, I had only scanty notes of our meetings and the <hi rend="italic">rough</hi> draft of my paper to refer to,—and in the margin of this <hi rend="italic">last </hi>I had <hi rend="italic">very early</hi> written<lb/> “?longidactylis      )<lb/>  ?hexagonalis            ) as a trivial name.<lb/>  ?pentag.——”  )</p>
         <p>A few days ago Dr. Newman wrote to me asking me to help in the forthcoming “Review”. I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to decline: but, <hi rend="italic">afterwards</hi>, remembering the 2 rejected “Ruahine” Mss.,—and <hi rend="italic">your</hi> remark, of their being (as they were written) “more fit for a Review”,—I yesterday wrote again to him offering them, if they may suit. But, had I known I should be writing to you so early—I should <hi rend="italic">first</hi> have mentioned it to you.—</p>
         <p>Thanks, may, for the new Manual of the Grasses: having only received it yesterday (with your lot!) I have scarcely had time to look at it. I have, however, written for 3 copies (enclosed). Is it <hi rend="italic">quite </hi>right to write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for them—or for any of your pubs.? If not, tell me to whom. As I see the <hi rend="italic">large</hi> work on Grasses is now complete, perhaps I had better <hi rend="italic">remind </hi>you (as <hi rend="italic">you straitly charged me to do so</hi>) of your promise to send me a copy—that is, of part III. having already received parts I &amp; II from you.—</p>
         <p>I suppose “Hutton’s Manual of N.Z. Mollusca, <hi rend="italic">1879</hi>”, to be the one you had (in sheets) here with you.</p>
         <p>You mention the 2 plates to illust. the <hi rend="italic">Moa</hi> paper not yet being ready:—this leads me to ask, If Mr. Buchanan will be able to execute the 2 Botanl. ones I wished to have done (Trichomanes &amp; Clematis), even if at my expense. I suppose you only received the small parcel of specimens (Botanical) and their descriptive paper?—</p>
         <p>I have also just received (with yours) a packet from the Melbourne Exhibition Commission, Wellington,—asking, if those (few &amp; small) things I sent to the Sydney Exhibn. should be sent on to Melbourne:—and I confess I don’t know what to say; neither do I know, if I assent, how to fill out those papers.—<hi rend="italic">I would be wholly guided by you in this matter</hi>: just let me know, Aye, or Nay.</p>
         <p>I hope <hi rend="italic">the Bell </hi>(sent this way on Sunday last, 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.,) is safe: I have just written a note to Mr. Gore about it, which I enclose.</p>
         <p>But I must not take up any more of your valuable time.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
