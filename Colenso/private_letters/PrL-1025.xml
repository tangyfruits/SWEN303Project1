         <p>Dear Mrs de Lisle</p>
         <p>I was greatly pleased this morning, in seeing the <hi rend="italic">return </hi>of you and 3 children duly notified in “Herald”: I have been on the look-out for some time—knowing that my good friend your husband had returned to Napier, but almost (not quite) fearing, he was going to be <hi rend="italic">alone </hi>(like the writer) on Xmas. day and then, comparing his and your <hi rend="italic">last </hi>Xmas. day with this—<hi rend="underline italic">if so</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">separated</hi>!!!—I wished to send my little godson a guinea which I now <hi rend="italic">with great pleasure do.</hi> Please receive it (i.e. its substitute) enclosed for him and give him ½ dozen extra true mother’s kisses for me—nay, don’t stop at ½ dozen—nearer ½ hundred.</p>
         <p>I trust you have thoroughly enjoyed yourself—I think it was well to remain <hi rend="italic">absent</hi> from our <hi rend="italic">dry </hi>&amp; dusty Napier till the welcome rain came to refresh us (all hands yesterday). I have already told the Dr., in my note, that, on my <hi rend="italic">next visit to town</hi>, I shall do myself the pleasure of calling on you—I want to <hi rend="italic">see </hi>Rodolph—bless me! Entering on 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. year on Saturday!! with kind regards</p>
         <p>Believe me, Yours faithy.,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
