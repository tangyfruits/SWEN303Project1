         <p rend="end">Jan 1st 1880</p>
         <p>D.P. Balfour Esq</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>First &amp; foremost I wish you &amp; Mrs Balfour a <hi rend="italic">Happy New Year</hi>, may this one prove to be the best you ever have known.</p>
         <p>I have been awa’ wandering; away in the Great Old entire &amp; grand forests; where I am often led to think of those words of the men of old (observant men I ken)—when they speak of “the trees of the Lords planting”; and again of “the everlasting”, and “the mighty oaks”, and “Cedars of Lebanon”, &amp; of other mountains.</p>
         <p>Dr Hector arrived here (for the case against McLennan). I remained in town until after his lecture, when I took my leave of him, myself going to the “40 mile Bush”; I would that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had also heard his lecture; &amp; would, that those present on that occasion were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so anxious after their dear darling Tobacco;—so that we might have had an interesting &amp; useful discussion on several local points of Geology, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I showed him, while here, those stones of your collection; he went with Kinross a day to the Rau Kawa Run.</p>
         <p>However I went, as I have said,—&amp; only returned to N on Tuesday night (30th) having had <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of rain &amp; other hindrances. Your note of 27th with chq I found, &amp; thank you <hi rend="italic">for both</hi>; You are <hi rend="italic">the first</hi> for 1880!! &amp; only on the 30th I received a sub for 79!! of which am sorry to say 5 are still unpaid!!!.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>your caterpillar;—put one or two under a glass, with a bit of Manuka, &amp; await its transformation; noting its time in larva &amp; chrysalis states, not forgetting to let it have a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> air. I mention this, as my auld wifie here stifled my <hi rend="italic">young</hi> Lizards (2) in my absence; &amp; I am almost inclined to let the poor disconsolate <hi rend="italic">male</hi> go,—but I have thought that you might find me one or two <hi rend="italic">adult</hi> ones, in your rounds, if you can, please do so.</p>
         <p>Especially do I wish to get a specimen or two (say 4 or 6) of the enclosed, in <hi rend="italic">open flower.</hi> Three times have I been to the Bush in quest of this plant, &amp; must now go again (say <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Jan 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>); I had made sure of it, this <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time, but owing to the wet &amp; backward season in the <hi rend="italic">high</hi> forest, I was a little too early; it grows around the bigger trees of the Bush, climbing up to a great height; its small branches standing out, 12–18 inches from the tree. I expect its flowers will prove to be <hi rend="italic">red</hi>, &amp; therefore easily seen. I don’t want large leafy twiggy spns—having secured plenty, but merely the parts in flower, which are always lateral, &amp; jutting out of the sides of the big stems; I have promised Dr H some—I think you will find them on the <hi rend="italic">higher</hi> grounds—forests.—</p>
         <p>I have seen <hi rend="italic">little</hi> of Xmas, and today my pair (Scotch folks) &amp; bairns, have their holiday; so I am here (contented though) with my old Tom Cat!! And once more wishing you all and every good thing</p>
         <p>     I am Dear Sir</p>
         <p>             Yours fthly W.Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Have not seen my old friend P. Dolbel for 2 months,or more!!.</p>
