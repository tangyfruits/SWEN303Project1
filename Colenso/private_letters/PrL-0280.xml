         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>It has occurred to me to drop you a line—with reference to what you said this morning, that you should like to have a conversation with me, &amp;c.,—that, I leave town by Coach on Monday morning to visit the <hi rend="italic">nearer </hi>Country Schools, &amp; intend returning to Napier on the Friday night, or early on Saturday morning (29<hi rend="sup ">th.</hi> or 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst.)—and could call on you on the Saturday (30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.) if that would suit you. And, if so, please let me have a line from you to that effect. I am</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>truly yours</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I should also tell you, that on the Monday following (December 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>.) I have again to leave town by early Coach to visit the farther Country Schools, Waipawa, Waipukurau, Hampden, &amp;c,—&amp; shall not return until late on the following Saturday.</p>
