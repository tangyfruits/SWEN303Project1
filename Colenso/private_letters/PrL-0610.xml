         <p rend="end">NAPIER<lb/>Tuesday night <lb/>Sept 29th 1885</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour <lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My dr Sir</p>
         <p>I scarcely know what you are thinking of me at my not long ago replied to your kind (tho short) note of 29th August!! I had no idea of so long a time having passed since I received it until <hi rend="italic">now</hi> on again opening it to answer it. I had fully intended to do so last <hi rend="italic">week</hi>, &amp; had always kept it on my table, so seeing it every day; but some how I allowed <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Tuesday &amp; Wedy mg to slip by, &amp; then, of course, I had no more mail opportunities until this present one tomorrow. And so I write now to be in time. However I must add, that I have derived a <hi rend="italic">lee­tle</hi> bit of consolation irom the fact, of you having received my last to you <hi rend="italic">after</hi> you had written this to me.­</p>
         <p>And here I should also mention that, on the week <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the last (viz on last Saturday week—my last visit to town), I had arranged for leaving Napier on <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Friday for the Bush, but a letter to hand from Norse­wood last Wed evening gave such an account of cold &amp; <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> up there, then that I put it off. I had told our Scty last evening, of my visit to the woods—notso much for plants, as for a <hi rend="italic">change</hi>. I begin—or rather have some time begun to feel this daily sitting &amp; writing; the pain in my chest is steady &amp; is now anything but agreeable.</p>
         <p>Of course you saw in the “Herald” what was said about our meeting, &amp; also what Dr Spencer said, from the serial “Nature”.<note xml:id="ftn3-324" place="foot" n="324"> “At the meeting of the Philosophical Institute last evening, Dr Spencer referred to the high estimation in which Mr Colenso was held by English scientists. As a proof of this Dr Spencer stated that the June number of Nature gave a highly interesting and very flattering critique of Mr Colenso’s paper on his visit to the Ruahine mountains 20 years ago.” (<hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 15 September 1885).</note> I suppose Glenross library does not take in the publication; I do not know of anyone here doing so beside the Doctor.­—</p>
         <p>I have put off my visit to the bush until the 14th of Oct—so as to be here Eng mail week, &amp; on the following Monday at meeting.</p>
         <p>And now to your letter:—First your remark— “afraid to send me anything for fear of <hi rend="italic">distracting</hi> my attention—and not <hi rend="italic">find time</hi> to look at them”.—</p>
         <p>“Man”! do you think I am made of steel? Or working as a bond-slave?—<hi rend="italic">Neither.</hi> My regular life is just this—breakfast 7.30—in my back room, on <hi rend="italic">Botany</hi> till 10—then front room, Dicty till 1, p.m.—table cleared for dinner, then at 1.30, or so, at Dicty again till 4.30 or 5.—When I shut up <hi rend="italic">tired</hi>; eve­ning, from 6—till 10 or 10.30 writing—letters—papers, &amp; what not. I do not go out—don’t have any visitors (don’t want any).</p>
         <p>2nd Thanks for your Moss:—it was in a good state for <hi rend="italic">Calyptra</hi> but not for capsule—<hi rend="italic">teeth</hi>, &amp;c—so please secure more <hi rend="italic">when ripe</hi>. 3rd Shall be very pleased to have your <hi rend="italic">Xylaria</hi> spns.—I have had it here under glass, &amp; carefully tended with water for nearly a year, but no sign of fruit.! Also bye &amp; bye some flowering spns of <hi rend="italic">Drosera binata</hi>. I wish to compare them with Billardieres drawing of the Australian plant, which I now possess. I hope you are well, &amp; all at Glenross, and with</p>
         <p>kind regards</p>
         <p>I am yours truly </p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
