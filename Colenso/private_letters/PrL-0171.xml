         <p rend="end">Napier, June 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>., 1864.</p>
         <p>Dr. Julius Haast,<lb/>&amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c,<lb/>Geologl. Survg. Office,<lb/>Christchurch,<lb/>Canterbury,<lb/>N.Z.</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your printed Circular, dated “Geological Survey Office, Christchurch, May 5, 1864,”—in which you ask me “to support a motion which will be brought forward at the next Meeting of the House of Representatives, that some assistance be given to the publisher via England who will undertake to issue a translation of Dr. von Hochstetter’s popular work on New Zealand.”—</p>
         <p>In answer, Sir, I have to state,—<lb/>1. That,<hi rend="italic">as a Rule</hi>, I never pledge myself to support any motion until I am pretty well acquainted with its details, merits, &amp; advantages. <lb/>2. That, from having had in New Zealand the honor of the personal acquaintance of, and after correspondence with, several eminent foreign &amp; British Naturalists, (of whom I may mention, D’Urville, A. Cunningham, Ross, Franklin, Hooker, Dieffenbach, Wilkes and Sinclair,) whose researches and publications I have willingly aided to the utmost,—I shall consider myself enlisted to aid the the republication of Dr. von Hochstetter’s work (in an English dress,)<hi rend="italic">as far as such may be really beneficial to the Colony.—<lb/>
            </hi>3. That it will, however, have to be well-considered, (seeing our young Colony is already so far involved with heavy Loans, Provincial and General, and an unfinished and costly war, whether <hi rend="italic">at the present time</hi> our Public Money could be well spared for such a purpose as this (however commendable) referred to by you.<lb/>4. And whether the future (<hi rend="italic">not</hi>, by any menas, a <hi rend="italic">distant</hi> future,) would not be altogether preferable for such a Publication: when the many newly acquired Geological facts relative to the Middle Island recently collected by Dr. Hector &amp; by yourself,—to be, as I hope, ably supplemented by much more,—as well as certain valuable information relative to the natural productions, &amp;c. of the Colony, to be shortly hoped for, (from the series of essays called for by the Dunedin International Exhibition,) could be put together and made both generally and beneficially available. Seeing, too, that Dr. von Hochstetter’s <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> knowledge of New Zealand <hi rend="italic">as a whole </hi>was necessarily very limited.—</p>
         <p>I may, also, be allowed to add, that I saw at Wellington, in 1862, (in the Provl. Council Library,) an English translation of all that had been then published by Dr. V. Hochstetter relative to New Zealand: in which I noticed some things which were erroneous, and which were, of course, obtained by Dr. von Hochstetter, during his short stay, from information only.—</p>
         <p>With every respect,</p>
         <p>I have the honor to be,</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>Your most obd. Servt.</p>
         <p>William Colenso, M.G.A.</p>
