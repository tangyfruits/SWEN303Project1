         <p>Mr. Cheeseman,<lb/>Auckland.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Last year (’88) while sojourning in the Bush, I made the acquaintance of a Mr. McKay (formerly of Whangarei), who was also Boarding at the same hotel. He knew pretty much of Maori objects, &amp;c., &amp;c. And, among other things, told me of a “very curious Lizard” (?) he had found encased in a big lump of Kauri resin: that he had sent it to the Auckland Museum for your inspection, &amp; that you had written to him favorably concerning it.—</p>
         <p>Moreover, he had often sought to get it returned, &amp;c., &amp;c.—and, finally, he said,—in his going N., in 1889, he would see you &amp; get it.—</p>
         <p>Mr. McKay is still here: and I find, he did not go N.—but he has written an outline for me of the finding of the reptile, &amp;c.—and I have thought of dropping you a line about it.—</p>
         <p>Could you write me something satisfactory respecting it? or, better, perhaps, could you kindly <hi rend="italic">lend </hi>it to me? I would return it quickly and pay all expenses of transit hither and back.</p>
         <p>I may mention that Sir J. Hector formerly lent me their spn. of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon </hi>from the Col. Museum.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well, and with kind regards,</p>
         <p>             I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>                     Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
