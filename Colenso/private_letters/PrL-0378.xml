         <p rend="end">Napier, Hawke’s Bay,<lb/>Monday, December 23,<lb/>1878.</p>
         <p>Dear Robert Cathcart,</p>
         <p>This morning I was much pleased in receiving your letter of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. instant, and lose no time in replying,—and as I find a Southern Mail closes here tomorrow. I thank you for accepting my small offer, and for your letter—truthfully and feelingly written, one that my heart responds to,—and I send you, enclosed, a P.O.O. for <hi rend="underline italic">₤15</hi>., which I hope may reach you in time to be considered a New Year’s Gift;—and one most cheerfully given.</p>
         <p>Should you ever come to Napier, and I alive and here, I shall be glad to see you. I suppose, from a remark of Capt. Whitson’s, that you are now going to settle in N. Zealand, having had enough of the sea:—if so, I heartily wish you well:—may you prosper in whatever you put your hand to! <hi rend="underline italic">Keep a good look-out ahead</hi>; always keep on a regular true course; <hi rend="italic">don’t </hi>seek to carry too much sail,—or, in other words, go too readily in for <hi rend="italic">speculating</hi>:<hi rend="italic"> don’t </hi>take up drinking habits; <hi rend="italic">don’t </hi>borrow, if you can help it: and<hi rend="italic"> </hi>with good health, a willing heart for work, and <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> blessing, you are sure to succeed.—</p>
         <p>Permit an old experienced hand—nearing the “3 score &amp; 10”—to give you those few words of advice.</p>
         <p>I note, that you dwell much upon this point, that <hi rend="italic">if you had </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">saved</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> that poor boy, then you might have accepted what those kind passengers had offered you</hi>: but there I differ, a wee bit from you,—for you did <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi> leap overboard to save him <hi rend="italic">to gain</hi> a sum offered, (like a horse entered in a race,) but merely as a volunteer of your own free will and feeling heart; just as those soldiers, who are told off (and sometimes volunteer) for the “forlorn hope”,—for the desperate service of attacking a fort at close quarters; they know, when they set out, that there is (humanly speaking) no chance, for any of them,—that their comrades will march over their bodies and take that fort:—or, just as I have heard of some brave sailors, who, when some very dangerous work has to be done (in a gale, it may be,) come off and volunteer for it. I think my own sailor-boy has seen something of this.<note xml:id="ftn2-340" place="foot" n="340"> Wiremu was at this time working as a mariner.</note> I thank you much for your kind expression concerning him: you may yet meet.</p>
         <p>Excuse my long yarn (as I know you will); and just write me a line to let me know that the money sent has safely reached you; as we have pirates, and land-sharks too, in N.Z. And should you be writing to your old ship at Port Chalmers, just let the Captain know that you had heard from me.</p>
         <p>And once more wishing you well, in every sense,—and wishing you a Happy New Year, and many of them,—Believe me, yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                     Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Should you ever be hard-up for a ₤., look <hi rend="italic">this way</hi>.</p>
      </body>
