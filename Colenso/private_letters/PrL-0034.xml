         <p rend="end">Paihia, Bay of Islands<lb/>March 20 1843</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I last wrote you on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. instant sending you a Paper, giving an account of some new Ferns, which I hope you will safely receive.—It is however, not improbable that you may receive this communication <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, as I have subsequently heard of the vessel which took the Mail containing mine of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. instant, sailed with the intention of first visiting the Western Coast of New Zealand.</p>
         <p>I hasten to send this communication earlier than I expected, as I have heard of a vessel being in passage for Hobart Town, and an opportunity has now presented itself of sending my pacquet to Hobart Town. I shall send this, under care of the Captain, as the rate of postage, here, is high; and I have experienced, that although addressed to His Excellency Letters are not therefore free.</p>
         <p>I have only hitherto received No’s. 1, and 4, of the Magazine.—</p>
         <p>I should much wish, (<hi rend="italic">if it could be so arranged</hi>, and the extra trouble to the printer would be slight,) that this Communication, the one one of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. instant, (and if not too late) that on the <hi rend="italic">Moa</hi>, made up into one continuous work, and a 100 copies strongly bound <hi rend="italic">at my expense</hi>.—And, if not destroyed, a 100 copies of the Lithogs. of the Fossil Bones, and of <hi rend="italic">Lomaria nigra, L. linearis, L. rotundifolia, </hi>and <hi rend="italic">H. Frankliniarum. </hi>My old friend, Mr. W.R. Wade, would, I am very sure (if needed,) kindly superintend the Editorial department. An order on me, to the amount incurred, payable to any one here, or, on the account reaching me, my transmitting the amount of the same to Sydney, would be promptly attended to. I have several scientific friends at home, to whom I should much wish to send a copy. I intend writing Mr. Wade, by next opportunity, on the subject.</p>
         <p>I should much wish to send a few Drawings of shells, &amp;c., to illustrate this paper, but have not at present time to do so. If, however, an opportunity presents itself of sending shortly, I shall not fail of embracing it.—</p>
         <p>We have had a most brilliant Comet visible here for a fortnight past; its tail, immensely long, apparently occupying an arc of approximately <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">7</hi> th of the heavens. I hope it is visible at Hobart, and that I shall have the pleasure of seeing it noted in our Journal.<note xml:id="ftn1-36" place="foot" n="36"> The tail of the great comet of March 1843 was only exceeded in 1996.</note> Believe me</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Very sincerely yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
