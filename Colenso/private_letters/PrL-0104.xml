         <p rend="end">Church Mission Station,</p>
         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Hawke’s Bay, March 13/51.</p>
         <p>To His Excellency</p>
         <p>Lt. Govr. Eyre,</p>
         <p>Wellington</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a packet from Your Excellency, containing, a copy of a Letter written to some chiefs of this neighbourhood, dated, June 22/50,—a copy of a Government Gazette, No. 18, dated, Sept. 21/50,—and an exceedingly kind note of sympathy with Mrs. Colenso and myself from Your Excellency; which packet I received some time in November last.</p>
         <p>I should have long ago thanked you, Sir, for your Letter to the disaffected Chiefs, and for your kind notice of us in the midst of your numerous and important duties, had I not hoped to have been able (in conformity with Your Excellency’s intimation) to suggest a plan, by which we might be for the future free from similar annoyances to those to which we already been so often subjected during our residence here.—And such I may yet have in my power to lay before Your Excellency.—</p>
         <p>From the winter of the year 1846,—in which the floors of our house, which are raised nearly 3 feet from the ground, (the house itself being erected on the most elevated spot,) were 9 inches under water from the overflowing of the neighbouring rivers,—from that period I have on several occasions attempted to remove to a more eligible site, and have been as often thwarted through the jealousy of the principal Chiefs, who sometimes assented and subsequently refused to allow me to remove, and at other times demanded upwards of £100. for a small spot of ground whereon to build a house; to which exorbitant demand however, I had very nearly, through necessity, last winter settled; but, hearing of the expected visit of Mr. McLean to purchase if possible a tract of Land from them, I considered it far better, and ultimately safer, to break off my engagement &amp; to wait awhile, (although in so doing we should again in all probability be exposed to much inconvenience &amp; loss,)—that I might know how the Chiefs would act;—what Land they would sell &amp; what retain, &amp; where permanently settle. As well as to obtain if possible, the site we needed from the Government, and so be delivered from very much annoyance. And herein the Government will indeed have it in their power to help us much; provided, that, in those tracts of Land which now are or may be offered to Mr. McLean, there shall be found a spot every way suitable for a Mission Station; that is, according to my views. A place, possessing wood and water, and land fit for agricultural purposes, where Natives can quietly dwell without either annoying or being annoyed by the expected incoming Settlers. And, perhaps, should such a place every way suitable not be found in those blocks which are or may be offered to Mr. McLean, the Government would be pleased to allow and approve of my selecting a spot fit for such a Station; which could also be purchased by their agent (if approved of by him) from the Chiefs, &amp; then transferred to me for the foregoing purposes.</p>
         <p>I am happy, Sir, to be able to state, that those Native Chiefs who were last year so turbulent, are, at present, dwelling very quietly. With the major part of them I had made peace, sometimes before the arrival of Your Excellency’s Letter to them; which, however, has been of no small service.—</p>
         <p>               I have the honor to be,</p>
         <p>                       Sir,—</p>
         <p>               Your Excellency’s most obedient</p>
         <p>                 Servant,</p>
         <p>                               William Colenso.</p>
      </body>
