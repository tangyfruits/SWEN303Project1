         <p rend="end">Napier, May 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1882.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I have to thank you for the dozen copies of “Trans. N.Z. I.”, vol. I., 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. edn., which came safely to hand last week.—</p>
         <p>I have recently seen in your Wellington papers, the reply given by Mr. Dick to Mr. Hutchison, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Dr. Buller’s Manual of Birds: and, also, in a <hi rend="italic">late</hi> price List of Official Publications, &amp;c.,—what is therein said <hi rend="italic">re </hi>some other useful Nat. Hist. Manuals to be published “<hi rend="italic">shortly</hi>”: and, I have been engaged, during this last week, in drawing up descriptions of some new Ferns of ours lately discovered:—and all this combined, leads me to ask of you,—if you will aid in getting out a really good Manual of all our N.Z. Ferns?</p>
         <p>I am ready to do the classifying, describing, and writing part, <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi>; if you can aid with <hi rend="italic">good </hi>plates, and a few specimens of S. ferns &amp; forms, and a few extreme N. ones,—and, also, some <hi rend="italic">general</hi> information as to habitats.</p>
         <p>I believe I have by far the best <hi rend="italic">Fern Library</hi> in the Colony, and specimens from the neighbouring Colonies, including Fiji, &amp;c, &amp;c., and am quite conversant with the Order—but this, perhaps, you know.</p>
         <p>To have the plates done <hi rend="italic">well</hi> with <hi rend="italic">dissections</hi>, I would, <hi rend="italic">if necessary</hi>, subscribe (say) £50.—and perhaps they had better be executed in England.</p>
         <p>Will you kindly think over it, and let me hear from you about it.    I am, my dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
