         <p rend="end">Monday morng.</p>
         <p>His Honor<lb/>the Superintendent<lb/>of H. Bay</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Many thanks for your kind note and invitation of this morning,—I was quite glad to see your well known hand writing again, and that you could write as usual after the long shaking you have had.—</p>
         <p>I should very much like to attend any Meeting of Natives in Town called by you—also to be at your Dinner today, (as I think some of the <hi rend="italic">old </hi>pakehas should be there;) but I am far from well; I have for some time past been obliged to be extra careful—never showing out after dark, nor in rain—and I would not be out today only business called me forth. I did not move out yesterday; and I feel anything but well now—partly owing to damp feet.</p>
         <p>I am therefore obliged (believe me unwillingly) to beg you to accept my apology for not attending the dinner.—<hi rend="italic">which I am glad to see got up &amp; given to the Chiefs.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>If you should not be <hi rend="italic">over pressed</hi> for time or with company—I will try to see you in a few days:—Believe me, yours very truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
