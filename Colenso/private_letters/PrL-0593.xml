         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>March 24th 1885</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your kind &amp; welcome of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> I duly received, to­gether with a tin containing a live Green Lizard, &amp; a piece of peaty shale. I did not see the messenger, which I regretted.</p>
         <p>I was glad to hear from you again, and to find that you were pretty well, and (as usual) well employed—I wish I could say so.­ The little Orchid, I fear, we shall not see now for this season, also the seeds of <hi rend="italic">Drosera binata</hi>; perhaps next season we may be more lucky. Thanks for spns of <hi rend="italic">Mentha</hi> enclosed in your letter. I had supposed when inland that I had detected another species, &amp; had dissected it, &amp; drawn up its description—it varies much from the N species, &amp; so I was desi­rous of seeing your find, but now yours is much nearer the N species, &amp; only partially agrees with mine. There are several spns of this Genus in Australia.</p>
         <p>Your “Seeds” of the “introduced plant” Alfalaria, amused me a wee; these are scarcely seeds (though in a few of them a seed may be found, the seed having dropped—much as we may see in the “seeds” of the thistle, when blown by the winds. Very few, if any of them, containing a seed). These are the spiral awns of the seed, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>The plant is <hi rend="italic">Eradium cicutarium</hi>, a common English weed, though here it grows much more luxuriantly, like many other of our introduced weeds. It is closely allied to <hi rend="italic">Geranium</hi>, the main difference being, that in Erodium the seed vessel is spiral, while in Geranium it is circinnate, or rolled up like the very young ferns.</p>
         <p>The Green Lizard is a very <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">lively</hi> one; on taking him out carefully on my table he very nearly got away through his nimbleness &amp; activity. It is a handsome reptile, but I would he were away in his native woods enjoying himself among his family (if any) or friends, for I don’t know what to do with him. I purpose going to the Bush next week, and I always take <hi rend="italic">the other</hi> with me, to save its life, as I have lost too many (indeed all) through my careless folks, who, I fancy, dislike them as being uncanny beasts; I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to kill one last year, and did not forget it, as it took nearly 1 hour to die, though <hi rend="italic">immersed</hi> in spirits. I cannot bear to see, or think of, anything <hi rend="italic">lingering</hi> in dying through me. I shall try to keep this one alive, if I can possibly do so, to show at one of our meetings in the winter.</p>
         <p>I hope to leave N on Thursday week, April 2nd, returning about 23rd so should you care to write to me at Norsewood, especially if you should find a nugget or two) you can do so.</p>
         <p>Rheumatism, rather severe at times, still clings to me in the shoulder. Fortunately it does not interfere with my writing, but I cannot well lift my arm, wash my face, &amp;c, &amp;c, so I am often (too often I fear) a wee bit vexed.</p>
         <p>I have been mostly at home, very quiet, no callers; hard at work putting up some small Crypts for Kew, also in dissecting &amp; drawing up descriptions of some for a future Paper. Hope this may find you, and all at Glenross well, </p>
         <p> and with kind regards, I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly                  W. Colenso.</p>
