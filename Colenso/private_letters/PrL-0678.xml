         <p rend="end">NAPIER TUESDAY nt <lb/>AUG 14/88</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour<lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours of 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to hand last night (1.20) on my return from our meeting, which was on the whole a good one—tho I should have liked to see more <hi rend="italic">men</hi> (thoughtful M) present.</p>
         <p>I am writing you now, not because I have anything particular to say, but to ans your kind letter in <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for your <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> mail. I fear I don’t exactly know the right day of its leaving us, although I enquired purposely some 2–3 months ago at P.O. but I will enquire again.</p>
         <p>I am pleased in finding <hi rend="italic">you</hi> too, among the number who were pleased with my (Address)—I have received plenty of thanks &amp; kind words from old valued settlers &amp; friends, also some A.1. letters—one in particular from a gentleman <hi rend="italic">high</hi> in office, <hi rend="italic">many</hi> years in N.Z. and a countryman of yours, which came to hand on Saturday last. He had sat up all night (or till late) to read it, &amp; so thoroughly approved it, that he writes for 25 copies (from my bookseller) to send to friends (of his) at Home &amp; in America—will forward chq. Alas; there are <hi rend="italic">none</hi>; it was not printed for sale, &amp; being at my sole expense I only ordered 250 copies—all now issued. And lest you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be a wee bit puzzled I will enclose translations of a few Lat sentences in “Address”.</p>
         <p>You say— “You sent me a catalogue of books in Library last week”—but <hi rend="italic">none</hi> came to hand. “Old New Zealand” I don’t like as a book, or memento, of N.Z. History; it is a <hi rend="italic">romance</hi> (as I have often said) and so is John Whites “Te Rou”, as I <hi rend="italic">told him.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>There is but a <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> account of our last nights meeting in “Herald” of this this day (the reporter came in <hi rend="italic">after</hi> all was over; and gleaned a little from Hamilton, who was talking and bowing the ladies out,) and a still worse one in the “<hi rend="italic">D.T</hi>.” “Evg News” this night, <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have a better one. Do you take in or <hi rend="italic">see</hi> this paper?</p>
         <p>“Jubilee Paper” is printing,—16 pages (only) completed this day. I have arranged with Blair (a clever artist we have here) to have 3 Lith Views—copies of my old sketches—to illustrate it.</p>
         <p>I hope by <hi rend="italic">this day month</hi> (after our next meeting) to be again in my old Bush quarters, looking after my Hepaticæ flock. <hi rend="italic">Now is your time to pick up some Hepaticæ in fruit,</hi> also Mosses. Norton (Taupo) has <hi rend="italic">published</hi> his account of Tongariro &amp; Ruapehu in an Auckland Paper, he should have sent it to me (US). I pitched into him for it; he says in <hi rend="italic">reply</hi> &amp; defence—“he had thought Hill &amp; Owen had already done so”. It is very interesting. I am well. It is <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> today. With kind regards, Believe me always</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely      W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Taylor White has sent in a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> paper on “coloured Sheep”—it was to be passed as read, but I got it deferred until next meeting. I know nothing of the contents, but I told Hamilton to have your coloured wool specimens ready to show at same time. Have you any Good fresh Clianthus seed you could send me, (sods and all).</p>
