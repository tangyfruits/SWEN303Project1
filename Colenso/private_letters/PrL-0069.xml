         <p rend="end">Waitangi, August 12, 1847.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I can but suppose you to be, at least partly, prepared, for the tenor of this letter; any prefatory remarks will therefore be unnecessary, and, from my situation, I presume, an apology for this obtruding myself upon your notice, should be equally so.—</p>
         <p>A short time ago the Natives of your neighbourhood informed me, that you were unlawfully cohabiting with Charlotte Taẁi, a Native Communicant of our Church. I heard the information with astonishment, and rejected it as unworthy of notice.</p>
         <p>Very recently, however, that report has been again brought me by several Christian Natives, and that, too, in such a manner as to oblige me to pay some attention to it. Being very busy myself, I sent Leonard, my principal N. Teacher, (and a near relation of Charlotte Taẁi’s,) to Ahuriri, to make enquiry upon the spot concerning the same. He visited your place, conversed with you, returned to the Station, and gave me an outline of what passed—and it is the conversation which you had together, your admissions to him, and the sad consequences attendant thereupon, if persisted in—not to mention, Mr Alexander, the respect which I have hitherto had (and would still have) for you, or the present agitated state of my mind upon your account—which induce me now to write to you upon this very painful subject.—</p>
         <p>When I came first to these parts, C. Tawi was a Heathen girl. The Tribe, however, with whom she lived receiving Christian Instruction, Charlotte came under the same; in process of time she learned to read—became a Candidate for Baptism—passed through the different stages of Instruction—and, having been made fully acquainted with the rudiments of the Christian Religion, was Baptized, and at the last administration of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s </hi>Supper was admitted thereto. She was a young Native female over whom both myself and Mrs Colenso had ventured to rejoice in hope; she is now what you, Mr Alexander, have made her.</p>
         <p>Of course Charlotte Taẁi while she follows a course of open profligacy cannot be admitted to the Holy Table of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>.—And, as a consequence, all her abettors among her Tribe (being communicants) must also be debarred from the same high Christian privilege. Hence, I doubt not, some feeling the rod of discipline, will be led to cast off their Xn. profession, and thence the course downhill will be easy enough. You have already seen, how Paul Kaiẁata, the former Teacher of that Tribe has fallen off; you also, the other day, saw, how sadly Paul Torotoro, the present Teacher, got ill used by the Heathen Natives of the place, in his attempting to reclaim Charlotte from the path of error; you must have plainly enough seen the fearful spirit which the Heathen Chiefs shewed to Leonard and his little Xn. band when they visited your place on their errand of mercy; and, further, you must have observed (if not already felt) the difference in the present behaviour of Charlotte’s people, when contrasted with what it was when you first came among them. Let, then, the Natives know, that you, too, are becoming an enemy to Righteousness, and you will, I fear, certainly find that hitherto you knew them not; and, that the influence which their Missionary held over them, and often used in your behalf (though unknown to you), was much greater than you had ever imagined. And then, Mr Alexander, if not before, the time of retribution may arrive, and you yourself may perhaps feel the storm which you have been the cause of.—</p>
         <p>That I have been deceived in you, Sir, is alas! too true. But, I would fain indulge a hope,—when I reflect upon the general high tone of morality of your countrymen—upon your, doubtless, respectable family connexions (some of whom, too, I dare say, are worthy members of the Scottish Church)—and upon an idea which I must still cherish, namely, that you can not yet have been habituated to such ways. I would, I repeat, indulge a hope, that when you consider your error and its consequences, you will be led to do all in your power to escape therefrom.—For, while we are all sinners and daily sinning, to an ingenuous mind it is by far the greater evil to persist in continued delinquency than merely to fall into it.</p>
         <p>I say nothing now, Mr. Alexander, respecting your own state of moral fault before <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>.—I would rather leave that for His Holy Spirit to work within you; for which salutary change I devoutly pray. Still, I should, perhaps, make a passing remark in reference to what you told Leonard, (if he understood you alright,) namely,—that though you and Charlotte Tawi had committed wrong, yet it was not in <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> sight so heinous as the sin of theft or lying, in fact of but little matter at all!! I would, however, charitably hope, that Leonard misunderstood you; although, as he says, this sophistry vexed him not a little, and opened his eyes immediately to see, that you knew nothing whatever of the spirit of Christianity. If, however, you did use such language, and so attempt to pervert a simple child in Christ from his right way, you must surely have forgotten that these are such solemn words of warnings, as,— “Be not deceived fornicators shall not inherit the kingdom of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>;” and, “Whoremongers and adulterers <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> will judge”? There is now a poor young man dying at the Cape (Kidnapper, hard by, a young European at the Whaling Station there,) who once walked in that path, and who could tell you a harrowing tale of woe were you by his bed-side.</p>
         <p>Conscience, that faithful monitor, must certainly have told you—that you have drawn aside one of Christ’s little ones, one who did run well, from His flock—have caused the enemy and heathen to triumph—and given her Pastor and his few faithful Natives no little sorrow—and all this, too, in a still dark and guilty land, where the cause of Christ needs every human aid. In so doing you have placed yourself in decided and open opposition to your <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>, who, sooner or later, will avenge his injured cause, unless stayed by unified &amp; hearty repentance. Oh! How much, how very much, would the report of this your error grieve your Christian relatives &amp; friends at home, were they but to hear of the same.</p>
         <p>I am now, and shall be for some days longer, closely engaged with my Teachers of the District, assembled for their annual course of Instruction, otherwise I should have visited Ahuriri ere this. I intend to go there as soon as I am at liberty, perhaps on some day in the coming week, when I hope to hear that both yourself and Charlotte Tawi, are, through the grace of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, in a better mind.—</p>
         <p>Praying for which<lb/>I am, very sincerely yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
