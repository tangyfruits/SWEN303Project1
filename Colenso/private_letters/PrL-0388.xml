         <p>Mangawhare</p>
         <p>Sir</p>
         <p>The Governor of the N.Z. Institute having called upon us to contribute forthwith the sum of 2/6 per member per annum to meet the increased expenses of publication, and our Council having adopted the same, I have to request you to pay me the amount of your subscription, £1.1.0 (due on 1st. January last) without further delay.</p>
         <p>     I am.</p>
         <p>             Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>                             W. Colenso</p>
         <p>                             Hon Treasurer H.B.P.I.</p>
         <p rend="end">Napier June 12/79</p>
         <p>Mr Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I must not let this opportunity to pass by without writing to you a few lines; (of course, the dry official <hi rend="italic">circular</hi> which I am obliged to send to over 40, counts as nothing).</p>
         <p>I have often thought of late, why it was I never heard from you? perhaps you were unwell,—or bothered, at first with drought,—afterwards with <hi rend="italic">rain</hi>—perhaps I <hi rend="italic">owe</hi> you a letter,—or, perhaps, I offended you a wee bit in my last in returning your chq for £2—all these thoughts have been in my head about you.</p>
         <p>I have certainly lost a good deal of valuable time this past autumn. I left N. for the woods on the 29th of April—was overtaken by rain at Waipukurau, &amp; shut up <hi rend="italic">there</hi> a prisoner 10–12 days, coming back with Rheumatism which has been sticking <hi rend="italic">pretty close</hi> to me ever since. I have however <hi rend="italic">managed</hi> to attend our 2 past ordinary meetings, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I hope ere long to be able to say, your Hand Book N.Z. Flora has come; I wrote for 1 copy of the 1st Vol to be sent at once by mail.</p>
         <p>No doubt <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find it much colder up in your <hi rend="italic">high</hi> abode than we do here; as yet there has been but little cold, but <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of wet. Some time ago I heard from Mr Dolbel of Mrs Balfour &amp; yourself being well.</p>
         <p>     I am</p>
         <p>             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso</p>
