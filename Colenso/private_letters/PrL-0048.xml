         <p rend="end">Paihia, B. Islands<lb/>July 15/44</p>
         <p>Mr. J. Johnstone</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>I have recd. your Letter informing me of your having received mine contg. a remittance on the C.M.S. for ₤25., and further acquainting me of your awaiting the receipt of another Letter from me , ere you complete the Order for the Encyclop.</p>
         <p>Allow me, Sir, to say—had you sent on the Books the small Balance would have been duly paid you; &amp;, if you felt not disposed to do so, I think, (and my friends here think with me) you should have sent the first vols. to the amount of the remittance wh. you received. It is true, that we are entire strangers to each other—but you could have enquired somewhat concerning me of the C.M.S.,—or you might have had credited me with ₤10. for a few months—seeing that I hesitated not to trust you with double that sum.</p>
         <p>Howr., as we only draw Bills of Ex. on our Society at our ½ yearly Comee. meetings, in order that they may be signed by the Chn. &amp; Secy., and as both the Chairman &amp; Secy. of this Dist. are absent in the southern parts of the Island, &amp; will not return before October, &amp; not having any Bills of small amount drawn by me, I cannot now send you what would make up the sum required.—And as a vessel is now about to sail for England, I lose no time in writing to request, that you will be pleased, to send me the Encyclop. as ordered, applying to the Secretary of the Edinburgh CMS Association, or to D. Coates, Esq., the Secretary of the CM House, to pay you the Balance; or, to send me the Books and await my sending you the Bal. wh. I will do as soon as possible after receiving them,—&amp; would now if it were not for the reason above mentioned; or to send me the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. vols. of the Work to the amount of the remittance already sent, keeping bk. the last vol. of the lot as a pattern for the remg. ones wh. are to come after;—or, if none of the foregoing plans, (which are all that occur to my mind just now) is suitable to you—that you will be pleased to remit the said Bills of Ex. for ₤25. to D. Coates Esq. to be placed to my Credit.—</p>
         <p>And, while I confess I feel much disappointed on not having received the Books—do not, Sir, think, because I have written you the genuine &amp; undisguised utterance of my heart, that I am angry at your not having sent them; such I beg to assure you is not the Case. We may still do business together. And believe me Sir<lb/>                                  Very sincerely yrs<lb/>                                                         W.C.</p>
