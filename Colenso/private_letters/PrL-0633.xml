         <p rend="end">Napier.                                   <lb/>Wednesday, Sept 1/86.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Hill</p>
         <p>Your welcome letter from Havelock of last night reached me this evening (through, I suppose, the kindness of both Messrs. Fannin and Ferguson—or the Double ff’s!) and I thank you for it.—</p>
         <p>Of course I knew you were absent &amp; on duty (indeed, last week I considered you hard-hearted towards your juvenile flocks, in thinking to gather them together in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> wintry weather! our coldest for ’86!!) and, though I should have much liked to see you here—on Sunday or Monday—yet I hardly dared to expect it,—thinking on the superior demands of your good wife &amp; family:—and of your being little at Home. Still, I did wish to see you, or to know of your address <hi rend="italic">on days</hi>, (which you have <hi rend="italic">now</hi> kindly &amp; thoughtfully sent me,)—that I might tell you—1. I have not recd. a line from Govt. (indeed, I hardly expect one <hi rend="italic">now</hi>) unfortunately—through my not having been requested by them to go on—the unfort. Lex. is again at a standstill:——2. that I am halting ’tween two opinions about my going <hi rend="italic">next week</hi> to Norsewood: the weather of last week was so bad, and having recd. no less than 3 different letters from Nd. (each of them declaiming against the weather there, &amp; written <hi rend="italic">early</hi> in the week <hi rend="italic">before </hi>the great change,) I was, &amp; still am, in doubts, whether to go thither at the time I had fixed, or to put it off for a week of fortnt. In my last letters thither, I mentioned “Thursday 9<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.” as being my probable day—&amp; this, if poss., I will keep (for your sake): and if I do so I must also write to Hans early next week: but this will mainly depend on our intervening weather. Should I not be there at that time, I will write you a letter—so look out then at Nd. P.O.—I have had a <hi rend="italic">nice letter </hi>from little Charlie my mail-man (or boy—for he is very small, &amp; 7 yrs. or so)—in ansr. to mine to him, &amp; this I wish <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to see, &amp; should I unforty. be hindered I will forward it—as above. (Charlie reads w. me, at times, as Emma used to: I also wrote to Emma, telling her of your early visit to Woodville. Please remember her—&amp; me to her.—)</p>
         <p>Of late I have been working up a few plants, for my 2 papers: also finishing the heavy arduous task of arranging that Fungi List of Kew, I just showed to you.—</p>
         <p>Hamilton called here on Saty. last. I had written to ask for a better spn., (which he had promised in Jany., when he gave me a scrap—saying, his parcels were at Mohaka, &amp;c.)—but he has <hi rend="italic">none</hi>, which disappd. me.—He told me also of his <hi rend="italic">new </hi>troubles, &amp; you have heard of them. This day I have a note from him to borrow my vi. vol. of “Icones” contg. plates of “<hi rend="italic">Colensoa</hi>”—(published in ’46, or so,)—I have written, assenting, but informing H. of this <hi rend="italic">new</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">coloured</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">plate</hi>, &amp;c. Does he already know of it?——</p>
         <p>Am sorry for F., hope he will soon be better: his cold last week was <hi rend="italic">severe</hi>.</p>
         <p>Hope you are keeping well: don’t expose yourself—<hi rend="italic">not</hi> for <hi rend="italic">my </hi>but <hi rend="italic">for Mrs Hill’s sake &amp; bairnies</hi>. I am pretty well. Write me if you conveniently can do so: &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">try</hi> to <hi rend="italic">elicit</hi> something from <hi rend="italic">Gow</hi>. </p>
         <p>Believe me ever Yours truly W. Colenso.</p>
