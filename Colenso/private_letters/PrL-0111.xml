         <p rend="end">Mission Station,</p>
         <p rend="end">Waitangi,</p>
         <p rend="end">Sept. 8 1851.</p>
         <p>My dear Mr McLean</p>
         <p>Although I have more than both hands full—I cannot allow the “Rose” to return to your Town without a line of congratulation from me upon the late auspicious event of your marriage—of which your note of the 27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, &amp; Mr Cole’s letter of the 28<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> ulto., informed us two days ago.—</p>
         <p>We wish you every blessing which the Bounteous Giver of all good may have in store for you—and that you may have grace supplied to enable you to bear &amp; forebear.—</p>
         <p>By next vessel, I suppose I shall have to write to my old friend Mr Cole in a similar strain. You mention the <hi rend="italic">intended </hi>Mrs Cole as having “<hi rend="italic">lately </hi>arrived in the Colony”—I hope (may I be allowed to say,) that he is not in too great a hurry.—</p>
         <p>And then you mention Dr. Sinclair, as having “<hi rend="italic">often </hi>enquired for me, &amp; requested to be remembered, &amp;c.”—By this, I infer, that you are a friend of his, &amp; therefore, I may (also) be allowed to ask you to enquire of the Doctor, whether he received the letters which I did myself the honor of writing him—namely, in July/45, &amp; again in January/48,—as well as a packet, containing copies of my little publications,—as I have <hi rend="italic">never </hi>received any acknowledgement of the same.—</p>
         <p>I thank you much for your very kind &amp; early offer of a home when I may visit Wellington—but, (lest you may possibly become offended hereafter,) allow me to say, that I must continue to do as I have hitherto done—travel <hi rend="italic">snail </hi>fashion—carry my house with me.</p>
         <p>I must venture to suppose, that some of my few friends, to whom I had mooted the subject of my migrating to the interior of the Australian provinces, will think that I had a kind of foreknowledge of the <hi rend="italic">gold </hi>of those regions! Be that as it may, I can not but believe, that had I <hi rend="italic">gone </hi>thither, many would have said that <hi rend="italic">such </hi>was my purpose. I have, however, fully set aside that mission, perhaps for ever.</p>
         <p>In thinking over our <hi rend="italic">last </hi>conversation, at Porangahau, relative to Waimarama &amp; thence to the Cape as a desirable N. Reserve, I have, I think, concluded upon <hi rend="italic">not </hi>moving in that direction—mainly upon the belief, that I should be <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, or nearly so.—For, even as you said, the Natives will assuredly be near to the Whites. <hi rend="italic">For them</hi>, therefore, I have decided to endeavour to get upon the Tukituki R., (<hi rend="italic">or</hi>, the nearer R. Ngaruroro,)—and, if possible, at or near Patangata—perhaps the piece of ground which I had nearly obtained in the autumn of last year (1850). This spot has been again spoken of to me by Te Hapuku &amp; others—and, as it adjoins your boundary, it could be very well added thereunto for this <hi rend="italic">specific purpose</hi>. Karaitiana, &amp; the other Chiefs of these nearer sub-tribes, <hi rend="italic">wish </hi>me to locate myself upon a piece of ground about 2 miles or more from this, &amp; nearly opposite to the village of Tanenuiorangi, upon the R, Ngaruroro—which is, I confess, desirable enough for a station, only, as they were going to have their own “Taone” there, they could not well allow more than 4 or 5 acres for a Mission Station.—</p>
         <p>I intend, however, to get the matter <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> upon your arrival hither—unless the Govt. should be pleased to put any obstacle in the way—i.e. should not see proper to consent thereto. For I intend <hi rend="italic">never </hi>again to dwell upon land which is not <hi rend="italic">bona fide </hi>my own purchase, so as not to be disturbed any more, having had so much trouble that way.—</p>
         <p>I hope you will have full powers to do what may be required in the matter: seeing, too, that I wrote His Excellency the Lieut. Governor upon the subject last summer.—But I will tell you more when I see you.—</p>
         <p>I send you a note &amp; a parcel, which we have received for you since my last.—</p>
         <p>All local news, I dare say you will get from Mr. Parks.—</p>
         <p>My annual teachers’ School is now in hand—so that I am closely worked: this will be over in a fortnight—when I shall be able to breathe again.—And make my Northern visits as arranged.—</p>
         <p>Should you see your friend Mr.Taylor, gently tell him, that he is a letter in my debt:—ditto, Archd. Hadfield, &amp; Rev. S. Williams.</p>
         <p>Our garden is beginning to shew signs of returning life—cheering token of the paternal love of God, and of His truth, &amp; of the sureness of our Resurrection.—</p>
         <p>Mrs Colenso is pretty well—ditto Fanny—Latty <hi rend="underline">very</hi> so—myself tolerable. I am sure that Mrs. Colenso would wish to unite with me in kind respects to your good lady &amp; yourself—I am</p>
         <p>My dear Mr. McLean</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely, W. Colenso.</p>
