         <p rend="end">Norsewood, April 30/85.</p>
         <p>Dear Dr. Hector</p>
         <p>This afternoon I received the two packets of printed pages of your forthcoming vol. of “Trans.” you had kindly sent me for revision; and I thank you for them. I have lost no time in reading them, so as to return them to you by tomorrow’s mail,—and find but few real <hi rend="italic">errata</hi>, which I have marked: there are also 2 or 3 others, <hi rend="italic">doubtful</hi>, (being here away from books, &amp;c.,) these I will thank you to verify—by looking at my Mss.,—and deal w. them accordingly.</p>
         <p>In the larger (Botanl.) lot, there are 3 copies of one sheet,—which I suppose to be an error: I have only gone over <hi rend="italic">one </hi>of them.</p>
         <p>I have been, again, up here among the woods &amp; glens just 3 weeks, and intend returning to Napier next week. As before I have gained several novelties of the smaller Crypts.—</p>
         <p>Should you be staying at Home (Wellington) for some time, and have any spare time, and could let me know, I would thank you, as I have a subject I should like to write to you on.</p>
         <p>Again thanking you for your kindly forwarding me those pages.— I am,</p>
         <p>             Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>                     Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Please excuse wrapper—as I have no large envelopes here. W.C.</p>
      </body>
