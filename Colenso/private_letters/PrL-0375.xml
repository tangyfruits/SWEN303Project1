         <p>Mr Balfour </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I must not forget to thank you for <hi rend="italic">another</hi> lot of ferns,—received per mail.—I hope someday you may see here growing some of those you so kindly brought me.—And now, not content, I am going to tease you for more; (I fear it is something like the <hi rend="italic">old story</hi> of the “Willing horse”,—and of “One volunteer being worth 2 pressed men”).—I should like to have some specimens of the 2 Ferns enclosed; of the one (a bit only, containing 2 <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> leaflets).</p>
         <p>I only had a piece of a frond from you, of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi>, I have 2 barren fronds, &amp; I should like to see more, together with the <hi rend="italic">scales</hi> at the base (if any) and fruitful fronds—of both.</p>
         <p>Also,—if you could send me two or three nules (or leaflets) of each kind of Fern tree;—both barren &amp; in fruit, as this is a good time now at hand,—most of them shoot their new leaves early, &amp; grow very fast too.</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">parcel post</hi> is now commenced,—so you can send them by mail; the rate, I think is 2oz 1d, 4oz 2d, 8oz 4d—&amp; so on, and better send them <hi rend="italic">before</hi> being <hi rend="italic">quite dry</hi>; half or <hi rend="italic">quarter</hi> dry, would be letter, as they then don’t break in carriage, &amp; many of them will bear bending over, well.</p>
         <p>I forgot to ask you the day of the week in which you get your mail. I know the mail leaves N for <hi rend="italic">Puketapu</hi> 3 days a week. I know also you <hi rend="italic">busy shearing</hi> season is not yet at hand; for if it were I would not trouble you. If possible I hope to get out a short paper on some (few) of our N.Z. Ferns for our next months meeting.</p>
         <p>There is a fern (which indeed you also brought me) <hi rend="italic">very like</hi> the smaller of the two now sent—though it is larger every way.</p>
         <p>Hoping that Mrs Balfour is quite well, &amp; that you have nice warm spring weather—just as we have here,</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
