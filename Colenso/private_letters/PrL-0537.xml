         <p rend="end">Norsewood June 5th 1883</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I am thinking you will be a little surprised on seeing (above) my place of abode;—here still!!. I wrote to you shortly before I left Napier (on 23rd ulto) and then I said I hoped to return in a day or two. However I came here in <hi rend="italic">rain</hi>, and had <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of it the first few days—then the wind was fearfully high, so that there was no going out (for me), much less venturing into the forest—where among so much of dead standing trees it is very dangerous at such times, especially after heavy rains. Indeed the turnpike or Mail road was in many places strewed with trees and big branches—2 or 3 men employed in clearing the line, so I had to <hi rend="italic">wait</hi>—having come hither for a specific purpose, I was determined (if possible) to accomplish it.</p>
         <p>There was little change in the weather till the night of the 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>., then it became <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>, with snowing on the hills around, though not here. That night a hard frost, very cold, 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. fine; 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., a <hi rend="italic">glorious day</hi> but very <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>; the roads &amp; ditches have frozen, &amp; the frost on the shady side not thawed by night. I went yesterday to Matamau by coach, arriving there I took a snap &amp; a glass of beer, &amp; away 2 miles to the woods. How cold, &amp; wet, &amp; dark in them; there I worked till evening when I returned to the Inn—pleased with my days work.</p>
         <p>It was truly a glorious day; Sunday was also a very fine one—but this was super. From sunrise to sunset not a single cloud, no wind, and the air so balmy, and the sky such a heavenly blue. I stood on an open hilltop, among the woods, &amp; with an overflowing heart joined the tuis in praise. I returned this morning to Norsewood, &amp; away to the woods this afternoon and now have not done my work here—I fear a change for rain is again at hand, &amp; so I have been trying to make hay while the sun shines. Tomorrow I hope to go forth again, also (if possible) on Thursday—and return to Napier <hi rend="italic">on Friday</hi>.</p>
         <p>Sir J Hooker wanted particularly for the Roy Bot Gardens all our N.Z. epiphytal Orchids, &amp; I have succeeded in getting good spns of all, save the little Divott plant you have—of this I have but 2 poor or small spns. I want you to send me two or 3 plants <hi rend="italic">just as they are</hi> with the bark &amp; all; lap them up well &amp; send seperately by <hi rend="italic">post</hi>—I will repay <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">postages</hi>. I purpose packing a lot to go by English mail <hi rend="italic">next</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">week</hi>, so write now to let you know in time.</p>
         <p>I am keeping tolerably well, <hi rend="italic">better I think</hi> than at Napier. The Bush air agrees with me, but I feel the cold by day &amp; night—especially yesterday &amp; this morning, having <hi rend="italic">no fire</hi> in my sitting room (of course my own choice).</p>
         <p>             Hope you &amp; yours are well</p>
         <p>                             Bel me</p>
         <p>                                             Yrs truly</p>
         <p>                                                             W. Colenso.</p>
