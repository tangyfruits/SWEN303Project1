         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Tuesday night<lb/>Novr. 13<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1888.</p>
         <p>A. Luff, Esq<lb/>  Wellington.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Now that I am once more free! &amp; nearing too the middle of this month, I must drop you a line in remembrance of my promise in my last.—At that time I little knew what was nigh at hand for me—<hi rend="italic">a severe attack of Rheumatism</hi>, that lasted about a fortnight &amp; caused me to <hi rend="italic">lose </hi>much valuable time, &amp; <hi rend="italic">to work</hi>, afterwards, day &amp; night to make up for it. (Impossible!) I only finished my work for <hi rend="italic">our </hi>Society by 5 p.m. last evening—when I <hi rend="italic">was </hi>exhausted: &amp; yet had to attend meeting, &amp; returned to this place solitary &amp; worn &amp; weak &amp; sad, at 10.45: but <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">thankful</hi> that my <hi rend="italic">Society work </hi>was over.</p>
         <p>Your son kindly called while I was laid up—or getting better—&amp; then, afterwards, when he very kindly paid me a 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. visit, I was too much engaged &amp; weak to see him!</p>
         <p>Well: after I got a bit round, I went away to Bush for a change—much <hi rend="italic">needed</hi>:—I arrived at Dannevirke <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, day fine: &amp; went into the Bush adjoining <hi rend="italic">that afternoon</hi>, rejoicing: that night the rain commenced, with <hi rend="italic">stormy</hi> S. winds, &amp; such continued (with little &amp; only hourly intermission) during my stay of 10 days, bringing back Rheumatism <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>! so that <hi rend="underline italic">I had a sad time of it</hi>: fortunately I had with me a lot of writing (as I always have) but I could do but little as I could <hi rend="italic">not sit</hi> up without pain.—</p>
         <p>And now I am looking forward to my returning to D. But having business to transact, (Sperrey’s <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> paper, also, to fill in, &amp;c, &amp;c,) I <hi rend="italic">cannot </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">exactly</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">fix </hi>my time there—but hope to be there the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> week of this month, <hi rend="underline italic">&amp;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of next mo.—perhaps my best plan will be to <hi rend="italic">wire </hi>to you when there, which If I don’t hear from you, I will do.—–</p>
         <p>And now with kind regards,—<hi rend="italic">especially </hi>to <hi rend="italic">your son</hi>, (whom I shall hope to see here again when I am in <hi rend="italic">better</hi> trim) Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly                  W. Colenso</p>
