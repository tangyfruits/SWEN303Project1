         <p>Dr. Julius Haast,</p>
         <p>&amp;c  &amp;c  &amp;c</p>
         <p>Canterbury.</p>
         <p>Dear Dr. Haast,</p>
         <p>Your friendly &amp; frank note of 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. May I had the pleasure of receiving about the end of that month, and should have answered by the last Mail S., had I not been very unwell—scarcely able to read a line, or to do any thing,—and now that I am a little better I cannot delay any longer, although I feel shaky—unequal to the task.</p>
         <p>1. With reference to Dr. Hochstetter’s work on N.Z.—I hope your own many interesting discoveries and also Dr. Hector’s will either be added, or will quickly follow as a fitting sequel. Please secure me a copy for which I shall immediately send a Draft when I know the amount.</p>
         <p>2. Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Ms. </hi>(enclosed in yours). I greatly wish I had this earlier, but I will do my best to answer it, though <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> immediately</hi>. You speak of a Botanl. essay of mine which you had read in <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>., (that, I<hi rend="italic"> </hi>know, has been printed,)—but what I valued more was my <hi rend="italic">brochure</hi> on the Maories, (also written for the N.Z. Exhibn. Commissioners,) but which I find, from a note just to hand from Dr. Eccles, has <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> yet</hi> been printed!! This, although much too hastily written, in Jany. ’65, (I having only been allowed 6 weeks for its completion,) contains what would interest Darwin,—and indeed contains answers to a few of his queries. If you are writing to Darwin, you can tell him,—that I will do my best (<hi rend="italic">con amore</hi>), and write to him <hi rend="underline italic">some time this year 1867</hi>.<note xml:id="ftn2-137" place="foot" n="137"> No letter from Colenso to Darwin has survived.</note> He will, I think, recollect me, as I saw him in 1835, when he was in N.Z. with Fitzroy: besides he knows of me from my good old friend Dr. Hooker.</p>
         <p>I should tell you, that by this Mail I intend writing to Dr. Hector (with whom, I find from Dr. Eccles, the printing of this essay, &amp;c, &amp;c, now rests,—and from whom I have also just heard,) once more to urge on him the speedy printing of that essay.—If you have any great influence with him,—or with any of those Gentlemen of your large Province about leaving you for the Genl. Assembly,—<hi rend="italic">do use it</hi>: (<hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi>, I have had my thoughts, that my essay on the Maories has been delayed from its possibly having been declared <hi rend="italic">heterodox</hi>!)—At all events, whether in <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> or in Print, I should greatly like for you, &amp; Dr. Hochstetter and Darwin to see it, small &amp; hastily written though it be.</p>
         <p>3. Your request for <hi rend="italic">N.</hi>Id. N.Z. plants I would most gladly comply with—but I have so often been applied to that I have now but a <hi rend="italic">scanty</hi> Herbarium left, still I will bear your request in mind, and will hope (and really wish) to help you by-and-bye; as I intend travelling again in the interior this approaching summer. But I find time very precious, particularly since I undertook this heavy (unassisted) task of the Maori &amp; English Lexicon.—</p>
         <p>I thank you much dear Dr. Haast for your very kind expressions and Invitations. I may <hi rend="italic">next </hi>year visit your part of N.Z. I must some time see the Maories of your neighbourhood, and also those farther S. And with every good wish for your success in all your scientific undertakings—in all which I feel deeply interested—<lb/>  I am, dear Dr. Haast,</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I have just received the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. part of Hooker’s N.Z. Flora, and am disappointed—Large collections of the smaller Cryptos. I had sent him during the last 3 years are unnoticed. W.C.</p>
         <p rend="end">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. June<lb/>evening</p>
         <p>Dr. Julius von Haast,<lb/>F.G.S., F.L.S.,<lb/>&amp;c  &amp;c  &amp;c</p>
         <p>Dear Dr. Haast</p>
         <p>Allow me to request your acceptance of two little scientific works of mine (herewith sent) long ago published. Not that they are <hi rend="italic">now</hi> of any value, but merely to shew some of our A. B. C,—rude &amp; early attempts.</p>
         <p>I regret to say that mine on the “<hi rend="italic">Moa</hi>” (published earlier) <hi rend="italic">is wholly out of print</hi>, or I should have much pleasure in sending you a copy.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Ever your truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
