         <p>To His Excellency<lb/>Sir George Grey, K.C.B.,<lb/>Governor, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.,<lb/>of New Zealand.—</p>
         <p rend="end">Wellington,                               <lb/>August 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. 1862</p>
         <p>Sir</p>
         <p>I did myself the honour of forwarding to your Excellency, on the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of July, a Petition and Letter from myself.—</p>
         <p>On the same day, your Excellency did me the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the same, and to inform me that “you had lost no time in forwarding the same for the consideration of your responsible advisers.”</p>
         <p>In that letter, Sir, which accompanied my Petition, I stated my intention of also forwarding an open Letter from a few of the early Settlers and others of Hawke’s Bay to your Excellency in support of my Petition, and begged permission to forward the same, on receipt thereof.—</p>
         <p>Having lately received the Letter referred to, I now have the honour of forwarding it enclosed herewith to your Excellency.—</p>
         <p>I doing so, however, I beg, Sir, to be allowed to state,—that during the 10 days the said Letter was at Hawke’s Bay, (having been sent by me per “Queen,” and having been there posted to return by her,) the weather was so very wet and rivers high that scarcely any communication could be had with the interior; and which is the sole reason why certain of the early respected residents there had not been to town, and were not communicated with.—</p>
         <p>I may also, Sir, be further permitted to add, (having very recently heard here, that it was being industriously circulated that I had received large sums of money from the C.M. Society towards, or on account of, the present property at Waitangi,) that I never received from the C.M.S. any sum or sums whatever on account of the same, save the sum of ₤<hi rend="italic">15</hi>. (Fifteen Pounds) towards the erection of the large wooden building there; indeed, my only main difference with the C.M.S., during the 20 years I served them, was entirely owing to their disinclination to allow my reiterated (just) demands for necessary outlay on the station: and which, Official Correspondence extending over a series of years would fully prove.—</p>
         <p>             I have the honour to be,<lb/>                           Sir,<lb/>       Your Excellency’s<lb/>                  very humble Servant,<lb/>                               Wm. Colenso.</p>
