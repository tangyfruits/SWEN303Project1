         <p rend="end">Dannevirke<lb/>August 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>, 1894</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Mantell</p>
         <p>I came to this place last evening from Woodville, (whither I went last week from Napier for Ch. duty,) and found your long &amp; friendly letter (with others) <hi rend="italic">here</hi> awaiting me: this place being my main station in the Bush.—</p>
         <p>I have read your interesting letter 2–3 times, and I heartily sympathise with Atkinson <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the treatment his paper has received from the Governors of the N.Z.I.—Perhaps <hi rend="italic">I can the more fully do so</hi>, as I myself have also similarly suffered—though my papers (4–5) were not printed by <hi rend="underline italic">us</hi> until <hi rend="underline italic">after</hi> their rejection: and I could wish that Atkinson had adopted the same course. I suppose, you are aware, from my paper in the last vol. (XXVI) of “Trans.”, in defence of Von Haast against Quatrefages &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">Co</hi>., that in vol. XXV. Q’s. <hi rend="underline italic">old</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> published</hi> paper was again republished by the Governors! and, more recently, I find a paper of Maskell’s (just now read there at Wellington) printed <hi rend="italic">in extenso</hi> in one of your Wellington Papers!—how will they manage with that?—–</p>
         <p>I fear I have but little weight at <hi rend="italic">present</hi> with my affiliated branch,—its Council being mainly composed of unscientific folks;—but if the other—older &amp; larger—affiliated Societies were to take the lead, then possibly ours might be induced to follow. As I view it (and probably others also), the matter between Atk. &amp; Treg. is not as if between two on the same plane or field fairly equipped for the fray, but between one of the “right colour” with the Govt. of the day at his back, and one—<hi rend="italic">sans </hi>power, <hi rend="italic">sans </hi>coadjutors!</p>
         <p>I thank you for kindly remembering me with these 2 papers sent: I had, also, received from Atkinson a copy of his <hi rend="italic">second </hi>brochure containing Tregear’s <hi rend="italic">courteous</hi> (!) note, and now we have from him a second effusion with embellishments!</p>
         <p>You give me some <hi rend="italic">new</hi> items of interest <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Owen &amp; the first fragment of Moa bone, and your honoured Father: and I thank you heartily for your very kind offers—but I must decline taking up that subject afresh—having “said my say”: <hi rend="underline italic">age tells</hi>!—and I <hi rend="underline italic">feel</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> it</hi>!!</p>
         <p>I obtained, last year, from Christchurch, a written copy of Owen’s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> paper concerning that fragment, with <hi rend="italic">facsimile </hi>drawings of the same. I do not think that any useful information could have been obtained from Polack, neither from his book: for, <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>, it is evident he <hi rend="italic">never saw </hi>a Moa bone; had he done so he would have grabbed it. He did not (for he <hi rend="italic">could not</hi>) write his book: he supplied the rough materials, and the Bookseller of London got them licked into shape. I knew Polack <hi rend="italic">well</hi>,—a Jewof the lowest grade &amp; type,—had often been in his <hi rend="italic">Rum</hi>-store (a big raupo whare) on Kororareka beach; and had seen the wreck of his coasting &amp; trading craft at Tolaga Bay, &amp; there he was a prisoner for some time owing to that wreck. Polack was never at E. Cape nor at Poverty Bay—the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> known deposits (then) of Moa bones. And though I (or, rather, <hi rend="italic">we</hi>) had <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> of his book in “the Bay,” I never saw a copy until a few years ago. When, in ordering books from London for our Society, I got a 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>.-hand copy of it for myself—yet this I had not read nor looked much into; and I was not even aware of any mention in it of “struthious” birds until Hamilton from Dunedin some 2 years ago pointed such out to me in a letter!</p>
         <p>Yes: I had noticed that <hi rend="italic">addition </hi>of “Dr.” to “Rule” with the first fragment.—Curiously enough! I have here to hand by Mail, the May number of “Proceedings Linnean Society” containing a long panegyric on Owen.—–</p>
         <p>What can you mean, in saying of yourself, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>copying a Ms.— “<hi rend="underline italic">I am too blind</hi>”?—I hope not.</p>
         <p>I have to return to Woodville on Saturday next for <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>, &amp; perhaps next week to Napier.—</p>
         <p>           With very kind regards,</p>
         <p>                   Yours faithfully,       W. Colenso.</p>
