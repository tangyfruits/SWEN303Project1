         <p>Mr Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I am sure I don’t know what you can be thinking of me—even allowing you to possess a double share of charity—when I look (again) at the date of your last letter; “Jan 3rd”, enclosing too, such nice specimens,—However I am determined, as far as I may, to make sure this week &amp; not put off writing until tomorrow to go to you by your <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> mail on Saturday. I should however say, that I could not write <hi rend="italic">last</hi> week, being <hi rend="italic">very</hi> unwell &amp; in the doctors hands,—indeed, I am still <hi rend="italic">taking</hi> medicine, &amp;c, &amp; Dr Hitching only left a short time ago; but I am getting better very fast, although I do not think I shall go to town for all <hi rend="italic">this</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">week</hi>; I may go (D.V), about Monday next.</p>
         <p>Now, then, to your letter—I was very much pleased with it, pleased to find that you had found anything to interest you in mine, but particularly with your very nice specimen of a fern, which arrived in excellent condition. I have already given it 2–3 hours study; (owing to my having so many books of Reference to refer to by various Authors, and no <hi rend="italic">specimens</hi>—save yours—at hand), for the time it must pass as a variety of <hi rend="italic">Lomaria</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">alpina</hi>,—which Dr Hooker (and his dear father before him) says is a native of N.Z.,—as well as of many other countries!. Indeed Sir William (in his <hi rend="italic">Species</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Filicum</hi>) says “This interesting little <hi rend="italic">Lomaria</hi> has a most extensive Geographical range—it may be said to circumscribe the Globe, wherever there is land between lat 35º and 55ºS”.</p>
         <p>So far so good; but here, now, comes the <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it.—This fern (or rather <hi rend="italic">the one</hi> now lumped together, from a comparison of several specimens from various parts of the world) is composed of many—which taken separately, were (or are) different; and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> description is then drawn up to try to suit them all!. Here, many modern Botanists are at variance with me, or I with them; I don’t like this plan, it is too synthetic for me. I have a whole page of synonomy alone, of this <hi rend="italic">one</hi> fern, as it has been at various times of late years described by Hooker, and each time too, by <hi rend="italic">eminent</hi> Botanists, great men in their day. Some of those names I will give you on a separate bit of paper.—I am pleased to find, you have a few more specimens of it for me, and if you have any <hi rend="italic">young fertile fronds</hi> among them, try (at your liesure), to get me one. I wish to see the <hi rend="italic">Involucre</hi> in its early stages.</p>
         <p>Your pretty little pink blossomed <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> I know well, it grows here on this hill, plentiful here, &amp; generally to be found in N.Z. during this last early summer; I often admired it, for it had always been a favourite plant of mine. This species is named (by Hooker in his Hand Book), <hi rend="italic">D. auriculata</hi>, and is said to be identical with one found in Tasmania and Australia. There is a curious white flowered one, which is very rare in N.Z. (I only found it in one low spot near the base of Tongariro,) it has linear leaves, &amp; one flower on the top of its stem. Should you meet with this species, secure specimens; it has also been found in the Mid Island near the snow.</p>
         <p>You will have been surprised to hear of the <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi> death of Mr Watt. I was with him in town the day before (though unwell then myself), &amp; he told me how very well he felt himself, &amp; how nicely the weather agreed with him, &amp;c, &amp;c. In about 24 hours he was gone.</p>
         <p>Well, as I remarked this morning to a friend who called,—may my end (when the time comes) be of that <hi rend="italic">quick</hi> nature. Better still (with me) to be killed by lightning.—But enough.</p>
         <p>I have <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> to do in the writing way; always so; and now this worrying confounded Land Tax Act of Greys (with its ugly “Forms”) gives me more bother, and takes away from me my <hi rend="italic">precious</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">time</hi>. I am getting out the accounts, Report &amp;c, for <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Annual Meeting, on 3rd Feby. I hope the new lot of books may arrive in N.Z. <hi rend="italic">before</hi> then. By the way, I have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sets of Hookers “Hand Book of N.Z.Flora”, 2 Vols, in that case of books, &amp; can spare you one—if you wish to have the work; price, I believe, £2.2.0—the 2 Vols. I have not seen Mr Dolbel <hi rend="italic">for the year</hi>; neither have I heard from him; I hope he is <hi rend="italic">well</hi>—somewhere.</p>
         <p>By this time next week I hope to spend a week in the 40 mile “Bush”—at Norsewood. Hoping you are quite well, also Mrs Balfour (to whom please present my respects) </p>
         <p>I am, </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly.</p>

         <p>Among the above names of the Botanists are several Continental ones, German and French, who have also published their plants with <hi rend="italic">plates</hi> &amp; descriptions.</p>
         <p>I should observe—that I was the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to publish it as found in N.Z., as L. linearis;—which was done in the Tasmanian Philosophl. Journal in 1842. W.C.</p>
         <p>I still have <hi rend="italic">my doubts</hi>
