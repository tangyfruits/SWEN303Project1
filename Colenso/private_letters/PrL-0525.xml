         <p rend="end">Napier, Jany. 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1883.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have received yours of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., and I thank you for it: seeing however, from its tenor, that there is some amount of misunderstanding (either on my part, or on yours) existing, I must do my best to remove it; though to do so will cause me some extra writing.</p>
         <p>1. You say,— “I did not know that I had not fully replied to your last letter, which arrived just as I was starting for Otago”. Now this implies (if I read it correctly) that you did reply to that last letter’ whereas my complaint to you, was that you had never replied or written at all—and that, too, for 7–8 months! (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) I find, that the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>note I received from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, is dated “May 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>.: and the last 2 brief official letters (and the only ones during the latter half of 1882) were in October; (1) dated 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., merely acknowledging the receipt of 7 Papers: and (2) dated 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., <hi rend="italic">re</hi> vacancies through death in List of Hony. Members. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) On the contrary, I find, that during that same long period I have written to you, and to your Secretary, no less than 18 times, (part officially, &amp; part friendly,) as follows:—<lb/>(<hi rend="italic">to Dr. Hector</hi>), 1882: May 16, ditto 29, June 21, July 13, Octr. 14 (4 letters of this date, 2 official and 2 private), Novr. 1 (offl.), ditto <hi rend="italic">priv</hi>., Decr. 14 (official) ditto <hi rend="italic">p</hi>: 1883, Jany. 4 (offl.) ditto <hi rend="italic">priv.</hi>—<lb/>(to Mr. Gore, Secretary.) May 29, July 1, ditto 13, Augt. 26 = total, 18.—</p>
         <p>I do not mean to say that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of them required an answer,—but some of them certainly did, both of the offl. and private ones; but I received no reply, save as above.</p>
         <p>And, as I have also now received from you an Official letter of thanks (dated Jany. 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) for the dried specimens of Plants I had lately sent, I may mention that I never received any acknowledgement of the receipt of the 2 Botanical papers I had sent you in December.—</p>
         <p>2. You say,— “I wrote you some time ago about the extra vols., but have no reply only a further application. What I said, was, that any vols. beyond those for your members for the year to which the vol. applies, are issued from Stock, and for the cash value of these I am responsible: Members elected during this year have to pay extra for last years vols.” I do not know to which former letter of yours you here refer me, neither do I recollect it (in those precise terms), but this is just what I have been repeatedly seeking,—extra copies of the “Transactions” from you <hi rend="underline italic">and I paying for them</hi>: having had from our Council 2 years ago full authority to do so. Allow me to refer you (to go no further back) to my letters of July 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>., July 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., and August 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., and, again, in mine of October 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., from which last I quote:—</p>
         <p>“Three months ago this day I wrote to you, requesting 5 additional copies of vol. XIV. “Transactions”, for our then newly-elected Members, (<hi rend="italic">offering, also, to pay for them if required</hi>,)—and again, at the end of August, I wrote to Mr. Gore on the same subject, thinking you were absent:—but <hi rend="italic">no answer has reached me</hi>. Since then we have elected several more Members, who also <hi rend="italic">want this last vol. if to be had</hi>: I have told them all, that I should write to you, for copies; and they are waiting. <hi rend="italic">Please let me have an answer for them. </hi>Members of our Council have lately told me, that others would join us at once, if they could be sure of having a copy each of vol. XIV.”</p>
         <p>(The underlinings were also made therein.) However, as some of our Members have resigned, without taking the vol., I do not need any copies at present.</p>
         <p>3. The little Petrel, new to me, that I sent to you, supposing it to be a species of <hi rend="italic">Procellaria </hi>(from the character of its nostrils), is, you tell me, a <hi rend="italic">Thalassidroma (T. nereis)</hi>,—of course, a closely allied genus,—I thank you for this information. I have very great pleasure in consenting to your request—to add it to your collection; indeed, it was expressly sent for that purpose—if worthy.</p>
         <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>the dried plants: of which you say, “I have only glanced at them”. I do not wonder at your supposing the small and imperfect scrap specimen sent of the fine <hi rend="italic">Olearia</hi> from Blenheim to be <hi rend="italic">Ol. insignis</hi>: I had long thought the same, though I had several specimens before me (yet no perfect flowers), but if it should prove to be identical, then Hooker’s description of <hi rend="italic">O. insignis</hi> must be very largely altered, as this plant possesses important characters which his <hi rend="italic">O. insignis</hi> does not, and such, too, as he could not possibly have overlooked. I think, however, that I have pointed them out in my description.—</p>
         <p>And now I have gone through your letter.</p>
         <p>If you can tell me something about those small sharp-pointed molar teeth of some unknown Mammal, that I sent to you in May last, you would  oblige. There was much interest concerning them, and any amount of subsequent enquiries.—</p>
         <p>I am, Very truly yours, Wm. Colenso.</p>
