         <p>Mr. R.C. Harding</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I am thinking of preparing a letter for the cols. of D.T., <hi rend="italic">re </hi>my case of yesterday. And I want the <hi rend="italic">exact</hi> sums per ac. Mr. Margoliouth said he had valued ea. sub. section at: I took down for 44 (including the 2 Tn. Sns. adjoining) @ ₤450, and I have but a poor confused note of the others—both Sns. &amp; figs. of value—&amp; therefore I have thought of asking you for them, as I noticed you were busily engaged in writing, and to you I believe I (or <hi rend="italic">we</hi>) are indebted for your clear &amp; concise abstract which appeared in your paper last evening.</p>
         <p>Of course I could obtain them by applying to Mr. M., but I would prefer having them from you if you took them down.—</p>
         <p>May I ask you also to post a note <hi rend="italic">early</hi> for me, or (perhaps) send it by your youngest (?) Brother to me, when he comes to school next door on Monday mg.,—I ask for this latter, as I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> benefitted by the Town Delivery.—</p>
         <p>I will send this to your residence by my man this evening.</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
