         <p rend="end">Napier, May 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1882.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I am much obliged to you for your kind letter of the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. inst., and heartily thank you for your valued present of 12 copies of “Trans. N.Z. I.,” vol. I., 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. edn.—</p>
         <p>I should have written to you last week, but as you had said in your letter,— “I <hi rend="italic">send</hi> per steamer, &amp;c.”,—I waited to see if the said package of books might turn-up, by some one of the many steamers hence from your port, but hitherto nothing is to hand.—</p>
         <p>I hope to hear of your success <hi rend="italic">re</hi> copies of “Trans.” being conveyed at Mag. rates.</p>
         <p rend="justify">Now, as to the “2 Teeth”! First, you have evoked a smile by saying,— “I think I wrote you about the 2 teeth, and said what I think they are.” This, however, you <hi rend="italic">did not do</hi>. At least, nothing ever reached me, and there have been <hi rend="italic">many </hi>enquiries: indeed, <hi rend="italic">all are waiting</hi>. At our last week’s Ordinary Meeting (Monday 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) the question again arose. (I only received your letter on <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> night, 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) Please <hi rend="italic">let me know at </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">early</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> convenience.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p rend="justify">Second: you say,— “I have them yet, shall I return them?” As far as <hi rend="italic">I </hi>am concerned in the matter you may keep them, especially <hi rend="italic">if of any value</hi>; but they are not mine, only lent. Still, I think, I can <hi rend="italic">manage</hi> that little matter with the owner.</p>
         <p rend="justify">Then, as to the “fresh find” of teeth, &amp;c.,—which you wish to see; I will gladly send them, but (to keep my word) I must <hi rend="italic">first </hi>exhibit them here at our <hi rend="italic">next</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Meeting</hi>: directly after I will forward them with all their bones, &amp;c., to you.—</p>
         <p>I have been up on the S. end of the “70-mile Bush” for nearly a fortnight, but with my usual luck of rain! Out of 10 days there 7 were rainy, (I think you at Wellington had similar weather at same time,) still I got some new &amp; interesting things. I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to return quickly on account of our Meeting,—as so much depends on this poor Fag!—</p>
         <p>I enclose a copy of a local, which will give you a pretty fair <hi rend="italic">résumé </hi>of our <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Meeting for ’82.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well, I am, my dear Sir, yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
