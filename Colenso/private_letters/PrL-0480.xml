         <p rend="end">Napier, Sunday</p>
         <p rend="end">Jany 16/82</p>
         <p>Mr J. Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>At last I am seated to reply to your <hi rend="italic">long</hi> and proper let­ter of 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Nov last; it has always lain on my writing table among my un-answered letters, patiently biding its time, but <hi rend="italic">never</hi> forgotten. I had fixed on last Sunday for replying, but the Saturday-night over­land mail brought me a letter from Dr Hector, which took a good part of that Sunday to answer,—so yours <hi rend="italic">again</hi> was put on one side. On a <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> sheet I will endeavour to say a few words on your most impor­tant question. A short time ago I sent you a “Circular” <hi rend="italic">re</hi> a new Serial about being published at Dunedin; I had been (before) asked to contribute to it, and I had agreed to do so, &amp; then they sent me a lot of Circulars (stamped) for me to send out to all Scientific men, lovers of Science, &amp;c., so I, with much pleasure, sent you a copy; I mention this now because I have very recently received letters from the S, telling me, that Dr Hector had consented for my 2 manuscripts on the Exploration of the Ruahine mountain range, to be published in the new work; and I thought that you knowing this, would like to subscribe for a copy; you will have seen it is only 10/- a year. Several I know, will subscribe, as they have written to me about it.</p>
         <p>Last Friday (13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) we held a Council meeting of our Society, (Preparatory to the Annual General one for the first Monday in Feby), and as we have <hi rend="italic">nearly</hi> 100 members at present, we want (if we can do it) to obtain a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> more, so as to be <hi rend="italic">over</hi> 100; and so show, in the next Vol of Trans (as well as in our “Report”) what little and young H. Bay can do; &amp; therefore, to you, <hi rend="italic">as a member</hi>, I write, to ask, if you can possibly gain one or two respectable members from your locality­—of course, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> touting or begging,—if so, let me know, names., &amp;c, before the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> of February.</p>
         <p>I do not think I have written a <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> to you since I returned from the Bush on Xmas Eve (though I have sent you papers). After some delay in getting away owing to changeable weather, &amp;c,)—I left N on that me­morable day (?) for good or evil to N.Z., viz. the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Dec (the voting day;) at first I staid at Kaikoura (Fletchers) a few days, then, the following week, I reached Norsewood; that afternoon I wor­ked in the Bush, and that night; the rain set in, &amp; out of 8 days there were 6 rainy ones; My patience was tried, I confess,—still I found work for myself to do, with the Mosses &amp; insects, &amp;c, &amp;c. On my re­turn—my hands (&amp; head, too) were <hi rend="italic">full</hi> with writing for home, &amp; abroad, &amp; N.Z., and I am only now beginning to breathe freely.—I hope, at the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of this week, to be pretty free from all <hi rend="italic">promised</hi> jobs; and then I prepare for our Annual Meeting, hoping by <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> of Feby to have an­other Bush holiday, if the mosquitoes shall have gone to sleep.</p>
         <p>I hope you are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> (3) well, and with kind regards.—and a doz kisses from you to my namesake, believe me</p>
         <p>     Yours truly</p>
         <p>             W.Colenso.</p>
