         <p rend="end">Napier March 6<lb/>1865</p>
         <p>The Hon. Mr Mantell,<lb/>Wellington.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Mantell</p>
         <p>By this day’s Mail I send you an Offl. Letter of enquiry after two young Ngapuhi Natives. I much fear they may never again be heard of, and that there are several others in the same predicament: pray do all <hi rend="italic">you can in the matter</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I suppose I am indebted to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for the offl. letter of Jany. 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. (now only replied to by me) desiring me to proceed with the Maori Lex. I am sure I thank you heartily, and the Govt. also, and I hope to receive every efficient &amp; needful help to enable me to do it properly—to carry out my plans long ago told to Sir George &amp; to Mr. Fox. I have also written to you, by this mail, for further information. I should have written before, but I have been working hard at the “<hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>” (<hi rend="italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">nd</hi>), which is now, I hope, in the hands of the Commissioners—but will they print it?</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Do not believe all—or a tithe—of what you may hear respecting our Natives and their Pai Maraire visitors</hi>. It is a great pity the venal local papers should go so far as they do—acting so unthinkingly. </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">I believe Hapuku to be very very far from joining them.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I should like to write to you officially (if required) respecting a most severe sentence inflicted by Mr. Justice Johnstone on 2 young Natives here, (4 years imprisont.), and which however legal, is, under all the circumstances, most harsh, and at this crisis highly injudicious. It was a very common Maori case of purlieu (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> adultery), &amp; the Natives know of the <hi rend="italic">Settler </hi>at Taranaki having lately recd. a <hi rend="underline italic">less</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> severe</hi> sentence for what they would call murder! I sincerely hope the Governor will reduce this <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> sentence to <hi rend="italic">6 </hi>months (or 12).—</p>
         <p>                     I write in haste</p>
         <p>                                     And am,</p>
         <p>                             My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>                                     Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>                                             Wm. Colenso.</p>
