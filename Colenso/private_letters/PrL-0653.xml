         <p rend="end">Napier, Wednesday,<lb/>Sepr. 28/87.</p>
         <p>A. Luff Esq., <lb/>Wellington.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I duly received your kind note of 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst., (also Paper) for which I thank you. I have since sent you 2 (or 3) “Evg. News”—that you might know somewhat of <hi rend="italic">t’other</hi> side! I was pleased last evening to find they took their defeat so well: I would they had shown <hi rend="italic">less</hi> zeal for low abuse (&amp; storytelling) before. Of course you knew all about results of elections as soon as we did. I went to Hastings on Monday to vote for your old friend—&amp; thought on <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (&amp; <hi rend="italic">old</hi> times, here!) at the time. The rush &amp; mob was so great here in town, (though not to be compared with what it was 3 years ago!)—that, after going 3–4 times to the area in front, M.R. Miller &amp; myself took a cab &amp; went down to Spit to vote—in peace!—I must refer you to papers for particulars.—</p>
         <p>In town today I saw Sutton—I told him I regretted <hi rend="italic">his advt</hi>. in “Herald” this mg., I thought he seemed much cast down: Lascelles <hi rend="italic">more</hi> so. I think, that either S. deceived Bob P., <hi rend="italic">or</hi> Bob P. deceived S. <hi rend="italic">I had steadily heard (&amp; believed), that S. had </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">no chance</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">—as against Tanner from the beginning</hi>. If I see any thing <hi rend="italic">worthy</hi> of sendg. a copy of “Evg. News” to you, I will do so—I shall just take it in for a week longer—the boy comes this way with it every night as my man takes it in.——–</p>
         <p>I am pleased at your getting your 2 vols. of “Transactions”; how you put up <hi rend="italic">so long</hi> with the want of the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> year’s vol. I don’t understand.—Am also pleased w. your liking my Papers; the <hi rend="italic">Huia</hi> has been copied by Buller as a vignette for his big book!—and the Tree-fern was also copied into the “Gardeners’ Chronicle”,—and this <hi rend="italic">last</hi> wood-cut is <hi rend="italic">better</hi> done than the one in vol. xix—the lower right hand trunk is drawn black &amp; smudgy (up to end of 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. big<hi rend="sup"> </hi>branch of the <hi rend="italic">Panax</hi>) which should <hi rend="italic">not </hi>be, as its bark is whitish &amp; clean. There are also 2–3 errors in my papers (as in vol. xviii) which I will point out for you—as I have already done for others.—And at the end of vol. xix is a paper by a Mr. Blyth (on the Maori)—where he charges <hi rend="italic">me</hi> w. error, or worse! whereas it is <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> stupidity—not mine. I merely gave those words <hi rend="italic">as a quotation</hi>! (see, p. 515, line 9 from the bottom, also p. 535, line 7 from top, &amp; look at my paper in vol. xi.)—I have not found time to read any of it (the vol.), save to run over my own for errors, &amp; to <hi rend="italic">look </hi>at Blyth’s.</p>
         <p>I noticed, &amp; read <hi rend="italic">twice </hi>the art. on Tollemache &amp;c., but it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> altogether true: I only get 7½ &amp; pay Py. Tax, and even <hi rend="italic">this</hi> they seek to cut down, &amp; from men whom <hi rend="italic">I have always </hi>befriended—in <hi rend="italic">that way</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">low rate.</hi> For poor dear Mrs. Wm. Thomas’ death I was prepared by letters from him &amp; family. I am well, save Rheumatic tooth-ache: weather very fine. I saw J. Anderson in Town today looking <hi rend="italic">very</hi> frail; he told me he had been very unwell, which I had also heard from Mr. Paterson who kindly called here last week.</p>
         <p>Hoping you &amp; yours are quite well.</p>
         <p>I am, my dr. Sir,</p>
         <p>with kind regards,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>     W. Colenso</p>
