         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I had intended, &amp; hoped to have been far away inland today—but the weather (here) &amp; Rheumatism have prevented me; so I scribble you this,—to thank you for your kind note of 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, also for the green lizard. But first to your note</p>
         <p>(1) Do not trouble yourself any more (for the present, at least,) about the “Divot” plant; 3 of mine have flowered (long ago), &amp; Hamilton, also, brought me immature flowers of one from Petane; I have fully described it, in a paper (read at our last meeting), &amp; exhibited its flowers, &amp;c,—very small.</p>
         <p>(2) The Lizard; <hi rend="italic">its</hi> arrival surprised me; My man came in with a bottle, saying, “Heres another bairn (or wean) for you”; It is a different species from those I had (very likely <hi rend="italic">Naultimus elegans</hi> the com. green one, but a very fine one)—I also lament over it, as I fear I must kill it. You ask about the others!!! Surely you have forgotten, or have <hi rend="italic">I forgotten</hi>? they <hi rend="italic">all </hi>came to grief, <hi rend="italic">one after another</hi>, through the extreme carelessness of my people in my various absences; also another very pretty spotted one, kindly sent me from Wellington—all have perished.</p>
         <p>(3) I had a <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> time of it up in the Bush. I arrived there on the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> at noon, went into the woods (2 miles off,) that afternoon, it came on to rain &amp; I was drenched; Saty rain; Sunday rain; Monday rain; Tuesday rain, but I again ventured out to the woods, &amp; again paid for it <hi rend="italic">worse than before</hi>. Wed rainy—nevertheless I (who was half cranky with so much confinement, in a small room and <hi rend="italic">terribly smoky chimney</hi>; which prevented me having a fire, &amp; so kept me cold &amp; miserable;—I again went to the woods, &amp; again got wet—<hi rend="italic">worse than ever.</hi> Thursday was at last, <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>, but I could do nothing—save try to walk up &amp; down a bit in the sun—for I had caught a <hi rend="italic">dreadful cold</hi>—which remained on me 2–3 weeks, so that I <hi rend="italic">dreaded</hi> our last meeting night (before it arrived) having no one to help or aid in any way. That however passed off pretty well, but <hi rend="italic">next</hi> day, <hi rend="italic">again</hi> Lumbago &amp; Rheumatism, &amp; I am scarcely well yet; Verily I have had a full month of it.</p>
         <p>And yet (methinks you will say)—Going again to the wet woods; Yes, it is true, but the weather will be warmer <hi rend="italic">there</hi> now, (that is when it is settled), and I saw several nice wee little Crypts, and I am going to hunt them up ere the summer heats fall on them.</p>
         <p>The folks up there told me, they had not had such a week of weather during the whole past winter. It not only rained, but hail, and snow abound on the hills, &amp; the cutting cold Southerly winds;—and then there was no butcher within 6–7 miles, &amp; the weather being so bad, he did not come round to the outlying huts; I was glad to get away, &amp; would have done so <hi rend="italic">earlier</hi> if I could.</p>
         <p>You say you are busy shearing (perhaps, <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, just now,) good news from Home in <hi rend="italic">rise of</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">wool</hi>. Hope you are all well, &amp; with kind regards</p>
         <p>                                             believe me</p>
         <p>                                                             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                                                                     Wm Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. I intend returning on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Dec, to be here (and) <hi rend="italic">there </hi>for the voting.</p>
