         <p rend="end">Napier, July 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1882.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>At our Council Meeting held on Monday evening last we elected <hi rend="italic">five</hi> more members, and I have to ask you to grant us five additional copies of vol. xiv. for them. And, if these copies may not be issued to us <hi rend="italic">free</hi> (as the former ones just to hand were), then, I am instructed by our Council to offer to pay you for the same; but if these 5 copies could also be given to us, it would be a boon at this time, as we have only <hi rend="italic">now concluded</hi> to pay the Athenæum Committee £75., cash at once (and an annual rental on a lease for a term), to have our present room wholly to ourselves,—which we shall fit up, for Museum, students, Meetings, &amp;c., and which will cost us <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, and we have lately sent nearly £100. to England for Books.—</p>
         <p>I enclose a cutting from a local paper of Tuesday 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi rend="italic">re</hi> our Ordinary meeting on the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <note xml:id="ftn3-153" place="foot" n="153"> The letter is accompanied by a cutting reporting the HBPI meeting, annotated in Colenso’s hand, “Written by myself, at 2 a.m. on Tuesday! (after a heavy time in Council till nearly midnight!)—hence I have said <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of myself: vote of thanks was given, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c.”</note>—</p>
         <p>I found your <hi rend="italic">brief memo. re</hi> those 2 incisor teeth I had sent you last year; it was on the back of Mr. Gore’s official receipt for specimens sent to the Colonial Museum, and so had been overlooked. I greatly regret my having said in my last that I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> heard anything about them from you. Please let me know <hi rend="italic">something </hi>about the last little lot of teeth &amp; bones sent: as there are many enquirers, particularly Dr. Spencer.</p>
         <p>Ever since I received the copies of vol. xiv I have been much pressed for time,—in sending them out, each packed separately, entered, &amp;c.,—in preparing my paper for our last meeting,—in correcting proofs of my <hi rend="italic">old</hi> unfortunate specimen pages of the Mao. Lexn., lately sent me from Wellington,—and in writing to England by the mail tomorrow: so that I have not yet found time to look much into vol. xiv, save at Buchanan’s beautiful drawings of those Alpine plants,—these are beyond words! I have almost worshipped them! and from my heart &amp; soul <hi rend="italic">thank him</hi> for his elegant work, would that he might so illustrate our Flora, particularly the Ferns:—next week I hope to devote closely to them.</p>
         <p>Believe me, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>W. Colenso,</p>
         <p>Hon. Secy. H.B. Phil. Inst.</p>
         <p>I suppose you did not secure me a few copies of the unaltered “Addendum” <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Mr. Stack’s Paper, I had asked you for? W.C.</p>
