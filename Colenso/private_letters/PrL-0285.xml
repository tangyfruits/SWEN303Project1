         <p rend="end">Monday 15</p>
         <p>My dear Mr. McLean</p>
         <p>Many thanks for your kind intimation. That party however is <hi rend="italic">clear</hi>—I would that I could say as much to those S. of Ahuriri.</p>
         <p>When shall I see you again? I have looked in twice—but you were not. One of those times however I was deceived (<hi rend="italic">unintentionally</hi>) by Capt. Carter—as you were within.</p>
         <p>Tomorrow early, I leave for Clive to inspect the School there. I will call on you at ½ past IV. this evening.</p>
         <p>     Ever yrs truly</p>
         <p>             W. Colenso.</p>
