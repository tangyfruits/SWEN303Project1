         <p>Dear Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>A month ago I wrote both to you and to Mr. W. Mason, and I have recently heard from Mr. Mason that you were in the Country: Mr. Mason’s note is quite satisfactory: I thank him for it, and fully intend to send you a few articles in December.—</p>
         <p>I now write, (as a hearty well-wisher to your Exhibition,) just to ask, If you have, at Otago, a copy of the Flora Nov. Zeland. of Dr. Hooker, 2 vols. 4to, which you could place in your Exhibition: as, if you <hi rend="italic">have not</hi> and would <hi rend="italic">like</hi> to have the loan of one, I would gladly send you my copy, which has colored plates:—or, if preferred, the whole Flora Antarctica, 6 vols. I think you should have a copy in the Exhibition, as it is the only <hi rend="italic">British </hi>scientific work (of any size) on the natural productions of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Native—or adopted—Country. Let me hear from you. The essay I hope to send by next Mail.</p>
         <p>     I am</p>
         <p>             My dear Sir</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                             Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>I could also send you Owen on <hi rend="italic">Moa</hi> &amp; Apteryx if required. W.C.</p>
