         <p rend="end">Napier, April 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1882.</p>
         <p>Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I wrote to you briefly last week:—and now I am writing again!—</p>
         <p>I have lately received my Subscriber’s Copy of the “Postal Guide” for this June Quarter, and what I have read therein is the principal cause of my now troubling you.—</p>
         <p>1. I find, that a “Magazine Post” has just been established, at 4d. per lb. weight:—and, further, that “other serials” may yet be also “approved of” by the Postmaster General; and remembering the great trouble, and <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> expense I have always had <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the sending out of our yearly vols., (which, this year, will be largely augmented through our increased number,) I have thought this a very good time to write, to ask you to see the P.M. General, and to get some similar reduction (at least) for your big “<hi rend="italic">Serial</hi>,”—though, if not wholly free as a Govt. publication, 6d. a vol. should suffice. And as you may be well acquainted with our present Post Master General, he may the more readily grant you this favour.</p>
         <p>2. I have very often been asked for a copy (“author’s copy”) of my old “Essay on the Maoris,” (kindly published by you in vol. I., “Transactions N.Z. Institute”,) but those few I had have long ago been given away. Last year I even purchased a few copies of vol. I. (merely for that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> paper therein) to give away; and I have good reasons for believing I shall yet be asked for more; but I find that a <hi rend="italic">guinea</hi> a vol. is too much for such a purpose. I have, therefore, a proposal to make (please, don’t be offended at it). I see, in your last report (xii. Annual) of N.Z. Inst.,—p.424 of “Transactions,” vol xiii.,—you have the very great number of “<hi rend="italic">430 copies of vol.I. (2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">nd</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. edn.) left on hand</hi>”.—Could you not let me have a few copies, (say, 6, 10, or more,) at a nominal sum?—say, 5/- each?—I leave this with you.—</p>
         <p>3. I have lately received from the interior a small lot of bones and teeth of some little Mammal, which have interested me exceedingly. Unfortunately the bones are very much broken, mostly mere fragments, still there are enough (I think) for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and for Owen, to come to a conclusion upon; a few of the <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> ones are whole, or nearly so, and the <hi rend="italic">teeth </hi>(mostly molars) are in tolerably good preservation, that is, their surfaces; but it is these latter that have so bothered me! for, from their fine rough conical sharp-pointed surfaces, they seem to have belonged to an <hi rend="italic">Insectivorous </hi>animal! Moreover, they run very long (<hi rend="italic">in length</hi>),—indeed, as if they had been more or less consolidated: the internal cancellated structure of the few fragments of the larger bones is also peculiar. The animal may have been as large as a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> cat:—They are evidently portions of the skeleton of only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> animal (but not <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">20</hi>
            <hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the whole), and were found near the surface, among red soil, &amp; the roots, &amp;c. of herbage; possibly they may have been a century or more deposited.—My thoughts have been running in the direction of the ancient Maori “Rat” (? <hi rend="italic">an Mus</hi>), and also of Forster’s big Vampire Bat, (or Flying Fox) of the S. Sea Islands. (I should say, that I once kept a live Maori Bat for some weeks, and fed it with big blue-bottle flies, and its fine sharp teeth, though much smaller, certainly resemble these.) On my receiving the first lot (in a <hi rend="italic">small </hi>tin match box!), I immediately wrote, to get all earth, &amp;c., &amp;c., from the spot secured, and now I have a second small lot of bones, or fragments, to hand, (just enough to fill a dessert spoon!) but among them is another good molar tooth.—</p>
         <p>If you were not so <hi rend="italic">very busy</hi>, I would gladly send them: ere long, however, your usual heavy toil at this <hi rend="italic">publication </hi>season will be over, and then, let me know, when you have a little spare time.</p>
         <p>Also, (may I e’en now enquire?) what of those two Marsupial teeth I sent you in summer?—</p>
         <p>The extreme sickness up in the Bush has hitherto kept me from moving out in that direction—which I regret.</p>
         <p>Believe me, my dear Sir,</p>
         <p>very truly yours,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
