         <p rend="end">Napier, May 18, 1885.</p>
         <p>My dear Dr. Von Haast</p>
         <p>Your telegm. of this mg., requesting <hi rend="italic">instant return</hi> of Books, you had kindly lent me, I have received &amp; respond at once. I would that I had got it on Saturday morng. last, then your books could have gone direct by Ml. Str.:—now, I suppose, they must crawl thither by <hi rend="italic">overland </hi>Mail to Wgn.—</p>
         <p>I regret to say, that I have <hi rend="italic">not yet thoroughly</hi> read Quatrefage’s:—while Buller’s I have not looked at. When your packet arrived here, about a month back, I was absent in 70-m-Bush, whence I have only recently returned. Your kind letter was sent thither to me as you did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> say in it, that you wanted the Books returned early: but, on the contrary, that your “Lectures had just begun and your hands were full,”—and that I was “to lend the books to our mutual friend Locke,” (who is still absent at Gisborne, expected here I believe next Saturday). I was in no hurry,—having, too, <hi rend="italic">lots</hi> to do, after my month’s absence in the Bush.</p>
         <p>However, I have detected 2–3 small things, which I note. There are more, no doubt. I do not admire Q’s. style:—he, too, evidently, fully believes in the legendary migration, (indeed, like some others, gives the island whence they came!!!) and therefore does all he can in support of that story.—</p>
         <p>One thing however I notice, that Q. <hi rend="italic">never once </hi>refers, or in any way alludes, to my <hi rend="italic">record</hi> &amp; exhaustive papers on the Moa, (Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. xii,)—while he does to others (e.g. Travers’, White’s, Stack’s, &amp;c) whose erroneous statements I had in that paper refuted. He also, in a note p.168,) directs the attention of Writers and Authors to my <hi rend="italic">later</hi> papers, in vols. xiii. &amp; xiv, “Trans.”—but <hi rend="italic">that one vol. he entirely overlooks</hi>: can it be designedly? or, Had he not got a copy of <hi rend="italic">that vol. </hi>to refer to? He also, (I think,) ignores my paper on the N.Z. dog,—vol. x. “Trans.”—where, too, he would have found something—or, all that is known—respecting that animal.——</p>
         <p>Another thing that Q. has done (which I greatly dislike) is, the taking up with every thing—every strange story—no matter by whom written or stated, by the man in the street, or (as I told Bastian, when here) by a mere low Billiard-room marker! a fellow of only a short time in the Country: and putting all together as of <hi rend="italic">equal authority</hi>: hence I withheld mine.—</p>
         <p>I regret you must have your books right off. I shall write to London, by this week’s S.F. Mail for copies of Q’s. paper.—</p>
         <p>As I said to you before, look closely into my papers on the Moa (2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. part)—the Dog,—&amp;c, &amp;c. Even the stories (Legends), and Proverbs, will yield you much. In vol. xi. pp.95 &amp; 100, you will have a full account of the monster <hi rend="italic">pet</hi> saurian!—while another worthy had a <hi rend="italic">pet </hi>whale, on which he rode through the deep!—others, too, performed similar feats on albatrosses!—why not a legendary <hi rend="italic">pet</hi> Moa?—</p>
         <p>I am obliged to write in great haste.—Beware of trusting to any <hi rend="italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">nd</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. rate </hi>authorities in Mao. matters.</p>
         <p>Ever yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
