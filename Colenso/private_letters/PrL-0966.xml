         <p rend="end">Napier, Thursday night,<lb/>May 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1896</p>
         <p>Dear Hans Mortensen—</p>
         <p>This is my last night here in Napier, as I leave by express tomorrow for Dannevirke. I have often of late been thinking on you—and of yours there—and of Norsewood, and <hi rend="italic">old times</hi>! I fancy that I think on such things more than you do, or can do, from the fact of my being so much <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>. You may have heard a little of me of late, if you see any one there near you who reads our Napier papers: I send you one of Tuesday last, which may interest you a little.<note xml:id="ftn3-785" place="foot" n="785"> Root fungus. <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 5 May 1896.</note> The wind has been very high here all this day, one of my biggest &amp; oldest <hi rend="italic">Acacia </hi>trees has been uprooted by the gale. I hope you are all well at Norsewood, and have plenty of feed for the stock for the coming winter. I still hope to be able to pay you a visit while I am in the Bush District, I shall try to do so if the weather proves fine: I intend to pay Lund a visit at Makotuku, and I will endeavour to let you know of it in time. Hope your father-in-law is keeping well, remember me kindly and lovingly to him.—I am pretty well <hi rend="italic">at present</hi>, but I have for a long time been suffering daily from Rheumatism.</p>
         <p>Good bye, Dear Hans: kind regards to your good wife, and love to your little ones—from</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
