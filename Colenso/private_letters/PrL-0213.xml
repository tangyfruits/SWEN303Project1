         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>By this Mail I have written to Col. Russell what I hope will be a final reply to his unpleasant letter. I have even gone so far as to tell him rather than have any more such letters I would repay the whole of the advances I have received during two and a half years.</p>
         <p>I thought it proper to let you know this, as from many remarks which I have from time to time made to you I cannot conceal that this has mainly arisen through my helping the Dunedin Exhibition by which I lost so much time—had Mr Weld and Mr Mantell remained in Office this state of things would never have come to pass. Mr Fox, Mr Weld and Mr Mantell ever behaved to me in this matter as honourable men. I still think that seeing so many of the Royal Comms. are either Members of the House or holding high Provl. situations this might still be stayed—for in order to raise this sum if I have to repay it I must sell some property as I have no spare cash.</p>
         <p>I tell you all this my dear Sir before any final action shall be taken in this matter—lest on hearing of such you might afterwards blame me for not having informed you in time.</p>
         <p>I cannot write myself owing to a severe whitlow on the front of the forefinger of my right hand—which has given me awful pain for the last ten days—but which has been lanced—I have not yet had a reply from Auckland. I hope you are well &amp; enjoying yourself.</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
