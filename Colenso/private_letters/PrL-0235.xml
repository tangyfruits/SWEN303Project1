         <p rend="end">Tuesday morning</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have to thank you for the Otago papers. I regret I have <hi rend="italic">not </hi>a printed copy of my Essay on the Maories (I have often wished for one) I have written again &amp; again about it, &amp; the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> I heard from Dr Hector—was, it is to be printed at Govt. Press—that was when you were at the Assembly.—</p>
         <p>I send you your Essays you so very kindly lent me, and have to apologise for keeping them so long—they would have been returned shortly after I had them only you were away—and I had carefully put them aside.</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">burr</hi> you speak of—I dislike much, &amp; root it out—also the <hi rend="italic">lucerne</hi> (which is too common here, although of great value in S. Australia <hi rend="italic">as a green crop</hi>.</p>
         <p>I hope you will enjoy your ride and am</p>
         <p>             My dear Sir</p>
         <p>                             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. I have sometimes thought that my Essay on the Maories is not <hi rend="italic">orthodox </hi>enough—?</p>
         <p>There were <hi rend="italic">no Otago</hi> Papers in the large lot you sent me.—</p>
