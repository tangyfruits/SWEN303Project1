         <p rend="end">Waitangi Feb. 25 1850</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I cannot but deem it a part of my duty to make you acquainted with some of the more prominent features of the late extraordinary commotion here. And, chiefly so, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, from the fact (as I have been credibly informed) of some of the ringleaders therein having had the hardihood to write Letters to the Bp. about me!—and <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, from my having written to the Lt. Govr. to inform him of my ill usage and to claim his protection.</p>
         <p>From multitude of causes however I can only give a meagre outline, and necessarily pass over many minor matters.</p>
         <p>On the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Decr./49 I returned to the Station from my inland journey to Patea, &amp;c. having been absent a month.—I found the place all but deserted by Natives, no prayer meetings, nor schools, nor daily prayers.</p>
         <p>On Sunday the 16. I held the usual Services and Schools (though not well myself, as I scarcely ever am when at the Station at this season, owing to the prevalence of March malaria,) and, endeavored, as usual with me at the close of the year, to stir up the Congns. and Schools of the Station to consider their ways, speaking more Particularly to the Teachers and Monitors:—Renata K., Apiu. P., Noa, Katene. Noticed the congregation generally being very careless and indifferent and many of them asleep in Ch. during D. Service.</p>
         <p>On the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I conducted our usual prayer meeting; lecturing upon Ps. 101. 1 Noah &amp; Katene not present.</p>
         <p>On the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I held a full Evg. Service discoursing from 2 Pet. iii. 17; 3 out of 4 Teachers absent.</p>
         <p>On the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. and 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. I was engaged with Porangahau natives, going with them to Ahuriri to return some stolen propy. and to give 4 hogs as a payment for what was said to be still missing. In the evg. I held pr. meeting, lectg. fm. Jno. xx. 25. Abraham not present.</p>
         <p>23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. Lord’s Day. I held the usual Services, and School. At the Mg. Service the Natives were as last Sy. unusually sleepy, insomuch that I paused consy. during my reading the Litany, in order that they might start up as some were snoring loudly, and others wrapped up in their hot blankets lay stretched out at length. (I had again and again cautioned them about their hot dirty blankets as not only being a cause of sleep, but also a cause of fever at this hot season.) The Litany ended I rose up, and it was some minutes before the congr. had aroused themselves or rather each other; much grieved I proceeded to give out a hymn, but on seeing some still lying stretched out near the doorway, I called to them and desired them either to sit up as they ought to do in the Ho. of God, or if not to go out. Some one called out loudly, “<hi rend="italic">Ko koe ranei kia haere atu ki waho</hi>”. The Porangahau and other strange Natives, assd. here for the Xmas, being present, I deemed it most unwise to pass this by; so walking out of the Desk, I went towards the place where the one to whom I had party. spoken was (and whom I supposed to have ansd. me,) and asked him, “<hi rend="italic">E ta, nau ranei te kupu ki aau kia haere atu I toku nei ware karakia</hi>?” He quietly ansd. “<hi rend="italic">Ehara I aau, na tera tou</hi>”. I asked, “<hi rend="italic">Na wai</hi>?” &amp; the person was then pointed out;—Te Waka Te Kawatini, a chief of the Ngatihori tribe (an old offender, who had been again excluded from the last Com. for stealing a Blkt. from Mr. Alexander; and) who was sitting against one of the pillars of the chapel. Going to him, I twice asked him those words, “E ta, nau &amp;c.” To wh. he made no answer. His large Test. wh. I had formerly given him, lying before him, I took it up and returning to the Desk and pulpit continued the Service.—After Service, I was informed that the person who slept so long on the ground near the door was Oneone, Tareha’s father. At Evg Service, at Tareha’s request, I Baptized his dying child;—a pretty little girl named Tahitio, who had been gradually sinking for several months, and for whom we had done all that was in our power, in food &amp; medicine &amp; washing, &amp;c.—by night &amp; by day.—Her mother being the sister of K. Takamoana, &amp; a niece of Te Waka Te Kawatini.</p>
         <p>25. Xmas day. I struggled hard, and held Mg. Service and School as usual; but was very unwell. Mrs. Colenso distrib. 180 cakes, to as many wom. and child. With diffy. I read the evening prayers but cod. not preach. I should have asked my N.T. Renata to address the Congn. it being very large, but I had done so, on 3 several &amp; similar occasions in the spring, to all of which he refused; and, I had often heard of the pitiable alteration in his discourses in my late absence.</p>
         <p>26–29. Very closely engaged in making out yearly papers for Comee. Teachers, Helpers, &amp; Monitors, all away scattered.</p>
         <p>30. Sunday. Held usual Services &amp; Schools. Mg. preaching from Rom. <hi rend="smallcaps">xiii</hi>. 11. Evg. Ps. <hi rend="smallcaps">xc</hi>. 12. Gave notice of a extray. special Prayer meetg. tomorrow (being the last) evg. in the year, to be held as usual in the School-room.</p>
         <p>31. Morning read prayers &amp; held Schools.—Evg. Prayer Meetg. but was so unwell as to be obliged to leave in the midst; I strove hard &amp; returned but could not address the <hi rend="italic">few</hi> present. I was quite ill.</p>
         <p>1850. <lb/>Jany.1. Though very unwell, I sent for R., not having had any close conversn. with him very lately. On his coming I pd. him £1.10.0 (a ½ yrs. stipend, or better perhaps an expected donation,)<note xml:id="ftn1-111" place="foot" n="111"> WC: See Journal to CMS. </note> and we talked together in my study for some time:—I told him of several things wh. I had lately heard against him, all of wh. he denied; I remarked, that the evil report wh. one or 2 persons might raise about a canoe or a bridge or a road, wod. not be greatly noticed; but that it was a common saying what everyone says must be true; and that he should get up and testify to the falseness of those many “little things” now so commonly sd. concg. him. I said, I had scarcely a peson about me now on whom I cod. depend; that I had (on my return from T.) called on all, and party. on the Teachers &amp; Helpers, to consider their ways at the now closing year—but that out of 4, 3 had immy. gone off (N. and K. to Ahuriri and A. to W.—) and had only sleepily showed themselves on Sundays. He replied, It was very wrong in them to have done so. I said, another thing I am told is this, That whenever you conduct School you merely read the chap. and them conclude, without asking a single question; is it so? He replied, “Etika ana, ekore ahau kite i nga tikanga o nga upoko e wakamaori atu ai ahau i runga i te karaihe”! This statement and the manner in which it was spoken, opened my eyes a little; I talked to him seriously and affy., for I loved him, showing him, that he shod. have been the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>person to have entertained such an idea, &amp;c.—&amp; once more begged him to consider his ways, this too being the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. day of the year.</p>
         <p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Two Wairoa Natives arrd. from Rev. J.H., bringing Letters for me. Busy all day in writing Letters to N. Teachers at Wairarapa. Having rung the Bell for our usual Prayer Meetg. I went to the School room, and, after waiting a long while &amp; only 2 Natives coming (besides the 2 from the Wairoa,) I held a short service &amp; came away much grieved. On enquiry I found, that Renata had early this morning left with his people for the swamps a few miles off, there to scrape flax for Mr. Alexander; he and Katene had in September last taken the putting-up of a fence on the Station, for which they had asked £2.14.0, and I had promised to give them £<hi rend="italic">3.0.0</hi>.—but this they soon threw aside—and that he had told Abm. &amp; others, on my return from Taupo, that for them to do as I wished was the way to kill and starve themselves outright— “What! School Monday morning,—prayer meetg. Wednesday evening, School Thursday morning, a full Service Thursday evening, &amp; prayer meetg. again on Saturday evening—where is the time for work?” Hence it was, that Abm. left for Waimarama.</p>
         <p>3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>.–5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Busy, copying Journal for CMS. arranging for, &amp; printing plan of approach. autumnal journmey, &amp; also plan of visiting for teachers,—writing to them, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. At sunset, the Natives, congregating here as usual for the Sunday, I caused the bell to be rung, &amp;, finding R. was not forthcoming, went to the Chapel and read prayers, 62 present. Had some diffy. in getting across the river from the large Canoe being aground. R. was not there.</p>
         <p>6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Sunday. (Here I should remark that my plan is to ring <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> on the Sunday morning, the first bell at ½ past 8 as a preparatory one, &amp; the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. at 9, when I leave the House.) This morning, after the ringing of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. bell, on going to the river with Mrs. Colenso &amp; family we found the <hi rend="italic">large</hi> Canoe (wh. serves as a common floating bridge for <hi rend="italic">all</hi>) aground, &amp; my 2 household lads vainly attempting to drag her into deep water. While we were standing on the banks, Te Moananui and his people (upds. of 20) came up from R.’s village, &amp; I said to them “Did you not hear the first bell? Why did not some of you make more haste here, &amp; get to rights our bridge—it is the bridge of all &amp; cannot be done by two persons.” And aftds., on entg. the Canoe I said nearly the same words to the Chf. himself (who was next to me), adding “Why did you not send some of your young men on before you to help my 2 lads to float the Canoe for us?”—No remark whatever was made by anyone to what I had said—there not being room for any. Just as we were shoving off, Renata and Katene and their party came hasting down to enter the Canoe. On seeing them, I said, “Ihea koutou i te pere tuatahi, te haere mai ki te parepare i te waka? ekore hoki e taea e te tangata kotahi; no tatou tahi hoki tenei arawata.” L. replied, “E taea ano e Matiaha” (one of my 2 lads) te parepare atu kaua e waka iwinuitia ekoe hei matenga mo ngatangata.” I sd. “I spoke just now to Te M. and his party &amp; they said nothing; but when I speak to you, you turn upon me directly. “You, L. should have been here to your duty instead of being away the whole week.” Upon which he sd. a good deal. And on my desiring him to cease, he replied, “Kati ranei koe te korere,” &amp;c. – – Ko koe anake, – – ko koe anake —kati koe te korero.”—Katene also said, much in an undertone.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A great deal more was said by R. who remd. on the banks of the R. talking loudly, while we were crossing, which from the noise of the paddles I did not catch but I heard,— “Titiro! e haere riri ana ki te karakia; akaunei ia te iri ai ki nga tangata o te ware:—kota anake e wakakino ana I te ratapu. – – – Emara! Ehara ahau i te mea wakarite na te komiti,” &amp;c.—On Landing, I said, “R., if that is the state of your heart I think you had much better return to your house, and not come on to Ch.”—When he replied, “Ki te hoki ahau! ka hoki katoa, kahore he tangata mo tau karakia.” Mrs. Colenso, stepping on shore, said to me, “he seems determined to contend”; so, leaving him talking we went on to the Chapel. Mg. Servive over, I remained alone as my custom is in the Chapel until the bell rung for School; during wh. time I thought deeply whether I should place some one else over the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Readg. Class instead of R.; at last I concluded that he should come to school, and rise to take his class, to say nothing (at present) but to allow him quietly to do so. The bell rung, &amp; the Sch. having been opened with sg. and prayer, R. rose and took his class; and no allusion was made by any one to the occurrences of the morning. At Evening Service there were only 3 women present besides our own girls, and 35 men; the Cong. of the mg. being m. 60, w. 30, ch. 16—the majority who were absent sitting idle in the pa.—a sad beginning this for the n. year!</p>
         <p>7. See Journal:—</p>
         <p>To the few who remained, I said, “You have heard me accused by my Teacher of error, sin, &amp;c.—Now, I will confess my error, this is it.—My admitting many of those Natives, T. Pekapeka and others to the Holy Comn. the other day. You know that I said I would now take upon myself the responsy. (under existing circumstances i.e. an oppory. of the L.S. once in 1 or 2 years), of keeping any one away therefrom, unless for very gross &amp; unrepented crimes;<note xml:id="ftn1-112" place="foot" n="112"> WC: Tiopira’s appendix no.1.</note>—now this is my great error, that I should have allowed such persons, whose conduct is more that of pigs and dogs than Xns., to drink of the Cup of the Lord.—However, one thing will result from this—there can not now be any adult Baptism here next month.” The few natives who had remd. perceiving that I had ceased talking also withdrew. I, being now alone, went to the Comn. Table, and there thanked God with an overflowing heart for his great deliverance, and prayed for forgiveness and guidance, and felt greatly comforted.</p>
         <p>After we had all left the Chapel Abm. Poẁa (the only Teacher who had stood by me, and who, every time that T. Pekapeka rushed upon me with his threats, walked close up to my side) said to Katene (who was sitting in the village, nr. the path), Thou art the cause of all this contention; for it is mainly through thy continual talking to us about the excellencies of other Ministers, and finding fault with our own, that we have been induced to act in this way.”</p>
         <p>This evening Tareha’s child died, and great wailing was made for her.</p>
         <p>8. Wrote &amp; sent a letter to R.<note xml:id="ftn1-113" place="foot" n="113"> WC: Marginal note. As translations of this, &amp; of all Letters wh. passed bet. us have been already sent to the CMS., they are barely mentioned in the Journal. Lettr. to R. Appendix No.2.</note> (Note.) Read Evening Prayers; R. attendg.</p>
         <p>9. Read Mg. prayers, 52 present. As soon as prayers were ended they all went out. I afterwards heard that they had leagued together, 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. to attend no more Schools; and 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. not to allow me to appoint anyone to be Teacher, save one of themselves. This mg. I recd. a line from R. in ans. to mine of yesterday.<note xml:id="ftn1-114" place="foot" n="114"> WC: L. from R. appendix no.3. A day or two after (during my abs. at Tangoio) he sent me anor. note; extracts from wh. I here subjoin. (in appx. this letter).</note>—Heard during the day that the Heathen Chiefs generally greatly disapproved of the treatment which I had received from the Baptized Natives. This evening I buried Tareha’s daughter, Ani Tuhitio; &amp; read prayers in the Chapel; 88 present.<note xml:id="ftn1-115" place="foot" n="115"> A slip is glued to the draft here, though it appears to be out of context: “I suppose that L. having succeeded in rousing the evil passions of the Native Chiefs, (and, seeing the extent to which he had carried them,) his heart began to fear the ult. conseq., &amp; therefore he wrote me the foregoing. Mrs. C. tells me, it was brought by M., L’s. wife on the evening of the 16th. Jany, the day of my return to the Station.”</note>
         </p>
         <p>10. Read mg. prayers at the close of wh. all again marched out. Engd. in ppg. pp. 23, 24 H.D. and in preparing to leave tomorrow on a visit to Tangoio, etc., as previously arranged. Had extreme diffy. in getting any one to go with me as baggage bearers, R. having succeeded in keeping back those who had promised to go. After evening prayers wh. I read, I had a long Conversn. with Tareha (who mourns the loss of his child very much,) in the verandah of my house. Endeavoured to Comfort him—gave him totara timber &amp; nails for a fence round her grave; &amp; lent him my boat &amp; oars (the first time of their being used) during my absence, to go afishing. He tried much to persuade me from going to Tangoio; but I told him, I cod. not remain, not merely on account of the Natives having assembled there, but that this was a journey to make peace with and restore the Tribes of that valley from their late fall; which he also knew.</p>
         <p>11. Left the Station this mg.—leaving a note for Abm. P. to take the Sunday and Monday mg. Services at xi. After we had crossed Ahuriri harbour, Paraone Te H.—a Thames N., whom I was glad to get to go with me, told me what R. had told him that mg.—he had endd. to persuade him not to go with me to T., &amp;, finding he wod. “not disobey his Minister,” he, R., said, if Paraone had been from these parts he would make him remain. And that this mg. as soon as I should be gone, he, R., wd. go to the pa &amp; use all his influence to get the Native Chiefs to rise against my cows, which were eating their grass and not paying for it;—and, further, that he wod. not be satisfied with any thing less than their driving me from the whole <hi rend="italic">Island</hi>!! And that he would soon get anor. M., for M’s were plentiful enough. And, as to Abm. Poẁa, if he or anyone dared to take the Services on the Sy. he R. wd. get up in the Chapel and strike him, &amp; put him down.<note xml:id="ftn1-116" place="foot" n="116"> WC: See Journal.</note>
         </p>
         <p>12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.–14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. At Tangoio.—</p>
         <p>15. Returned to Petane. Heard this evg. of the sad doings of R. at the Station since I had left, &amp; of the great &amp; increasg. commotion there, and of the resolutions which they the Chfs. and R. had come to;—namely, to drag me before their “komiti” (assembly), and then, to propose 3 things—</p>
         <p>1st. That I shd. never use such words as pigs or dogs or log of wood, in ref. to them, for any behaviour of theirs; nor find fault with them for sleeping in the Chapel, &amp;c. and </p>
         <p>2. That my Public Services mast be shortened, &amp; to have no School; or (if I wd. not immy. &amp; fully consent—) </p>
         <p>3. That I should be driven from the Station; and, if I sought refuge in the Thames or Bay of Islands, that they would follow me, &amp; never rest until I had been expelled the Country.to here</p>
         <p>The people of Petane, upwards of 100 in no. were very indignant, and pressed me much to consent to come and reside among them, or, at all events, to be allowed to escort me in a body to the Station; both of wh. I strenuously refused.</p>
         <p>16. At Warerangi, where yesterdays sad news was confirmed by the chiefs &amp; others of the village who had just returned from the station whither they went to mourn for Tareha's daughr. They described R. (tho a relation of theirs) as being mad, &amp; exulting in the thought of how he would serve me;—firstly, by degrading by dragging me before them (him)— &amp; 2<hi rend="sup">ndly</hi> by expulsion.—Some had proposed now that 2 vessels (a very unusual thing) were in the harbour to go in a body &amp; forcibly take all my goods on board! while others pointg. to the no. of graves in the chapel yd., of those who had died during my residence, were not for allowing me to get off so easily. All were greatly angry with the Warerangi Chiefs, for daring to say, that I was going to Baptize some of their Children, and endeavd. to dissuade them from permitting it.<note xml:id="ftn1-117" place="foot" n="117"> WC: See Journal.</note> At sunset, when about to leave this place the ancient Chief Rawiri, (whose childn. and grand children compose the majy. of this Tribe) said to me, “White man! you are now going into deep and troublous waters; only one word will I say, Be patient; endure hardness.” I replied, that is what I have already determd. upon.—I reached the Station (to the great comfort of my W. &amp; family, who had been a few miles over the stony banks lookg. for me; and who had returnd. disappointed) by xi p.m. Long, however, before I reached Te Awapuni pa, the loud orations of the enraged Chiefs, as they passed up and down among their people, before their fires which glared in the distance, broke upon my ear. I entered suddenly and passed boldly along the pathway through their village, without receiving any molestation.—</p>
         <p>17. Early this mg. I crossed the river to the Chapel &amp; read prayers; only a few of those in the village attended, &amp; none remained to School. During the day a great no. of Natives arrd. from Petane &amp; other villages, some to cry over Tareha’s loss, and some to hear the result of this (to-be) famous Commee. respecting myself, all the chf. men of the neighbd. being also here assembled. Towards evening the Natives,getting tired &amp; impatient at my non-appearance, sent me a Letter, written by 3 of the prin. Chiefs, in, apparently, a kindly tone,<note xml:id="ftn1-118" place="foot" n="118"> WC: Letters from K. No.4.</note> but unfortunately for them I well-knew the stratagem, which they had laid to get me among them. Read Evening Prayers, upds. of' 100 present. Retg. in the dusk to the Station, I found Te H. by the River side, awaitg. my coming that he might shake hands with me, at this crisis, a truly significant &amp; friendly action; he did not however speak. During the evening I wrote &amp; sent my answer to their Letter;<note xml:id="ftn1-119" place="foot" n="119"> WC: my 3 answers No.5.</note> and, also, a request. to the Xn. Natives of other villages to disperse quietly in the morng.</p>
         <p>The receipt and readg. of my absolute refusal to appear among them caused great commotion among the discontented, who, loading me with abuse, vainly sought to discover who had informed me of their secret (?) determinations; Renata and Katene were indefatig. in stirring them up; the former proposing that they should take me by force, even if shut up in my Dg. Ho.—the latter inciting then to revenge for the degradation (?) they had recently suffd.. in my compelling the Porangahau Natives to make restitution to Mr. Alexr. &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
         <p>18. Went to the Chapel &amp; read Mg. Prayers, soon after which all the better disposed Natives returned to their homes; laughing loudly as they passed at “the sagacity of the whiteman!” Some of the discontented also left, vowing they wod. never again come to D. Service; while those who remained, proceeded to hatch further mischief. Renata bitterly upbraided them for their cowardice, &amp; finally counselled them not to sell us any food, saying that if he caught any one bringing food to sell he wd. fight him &amp; any one who took any part sd. be expelled also. He was also exceedingly angry with his bro. Noah Huke and with Apm. Poẁa (the assistant Teacher) for their going to fetch some valuable goods wh. had arrd. for me from Dixon and Co.—wh. goods I certainly expected they wod. pounce upon and dist. among themselves. Engd. in printing pp. 25, 26. H. Deaths. Evening, read prayers few present. </p>
         <p>19. Read mg. and evg. Prayers; very few present. Heard, that the reason why T. so earnestly sought to keep me from going to Tangoio on the 10th. inst. was that the people there might the more readily be induced to join them here. Busy in opening some cases, wh. were wetted in Landg.—Evg. prepg. for tomorrow.</p>
         <p>20. Sunday. This mg. just as we were going to famy. prayer, a nat. came from the village with a Letter. After prayers, it was given to me, but as I knew it to be from the disaffected party, I said I would not read it till the evening. Going at the usual hour to Church, we were hissed at as we walked along the path, L. being among them. The bellringer, who lives in the village, was not allowed to ring the bell, which we did however; and some were laid hold of, and their clothes torn off them while others were shut up in houses, to keep them from going to D. worship. Present 20, 19, 13 (including my own household of 12) several of whom, w. and ch., stole away from their husbands and fathers. L. held Service with the disaffected! none of whom came to ch. At noon I rang the Bell for School, only 13 males attended. Evg. I held Service, &amp; aftds., being very feverish, bathed in the river. Retg. to our house I read the Letter recd. this mg,<note xml:id="ftn1-120" place="foot" n="120"> WC: Letter from K.ma. No.6</note> and was astonished at its contents; I felt thankful I did not read it this mg, and that God had again delivered me. I consid. awhile, and wrote them an ansr,<note xml:id="ftn1-121" place="foot" n="121"> WC: My answer No.7. Note to H. &amp; P. 8 their answer 9.</note> tearing up their letter and enclosing it to them.</p>
         <p>21. See Journal.—</p>
         <p>22. ditto. My feet and arms and sides very painful.</p>
         <p>23–26. During the week engd. in instructg. my 5 Candidates for Baptism; and in compositing and printing the Society Jubilee Letter. Received several letters of condolence from various quarters; see  Elisha’s</p>
         <p>                                               Hirini’s</p>
         <p>                                               Te Awe’s—heathen chief at</p>
         <p>Tangoio.</p>
         <p>Heard of Karaitiana having been severely talked to by Puhara and Hapuku for his conduct. He sd. they had not done yet—that he was tired of hearing the bell so often and that P. and H. must not be alarmed at what they might hear hereafter. P. enraged ordered him to make haste and leave these parts, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>27. Sunday. With diffy. I held the usual Services &amp; Schools this day, being very unwell; cong. 57; and at male school 29. At the morng. Service I Baptized the 5 persons whom I had been preparing &amp; a few of the disaffected party were present at morning Service, among whom were Karaitiana and Katene; the latter sitting with his back towards me. Gave out at School a direction that those of the disaffected who returned were to be put down a step—those of the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. to the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>., and those of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. to the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. class, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>Feby. 1. The disaffected Natives, particularly Karaitiana, still talking largely of what they would do to me. I deemed it proper to write a letter to the Lieut. Govr.<note xml:id="ftn1-122" place="foot" n="122"> WC: Letter to Governor. No. 11.</note>—</p>
         <p>2–7. Visited Patangata &amp; other villages inland, as had been previously arranged. Was exceedingly gratified at the kind feelg. reception I everywhere received. Every native m. w. and child, Xn. or Heathen, assembled to give me a most cheering welcome.—The nights were passed in a display of their indignant oratory against the disaffected.—I here learned the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> of the report (wh. my lads &amp; others had heard but had concealed from me), namely, that the disaffected chiefs had agreed that if I attempted to Baptize, &amp;c, I should be seized and bound up (pitote) like a pig; why they did not fulfil their vow, has yet to be explained.—</p>
         <p>On retg. to the station, I found that the disaffected party was still bent on further mischief. Among other things which they last Sunday projected was, for R. and Kat. to go immy. to Auckland to fetch anor. Minister!! this they strove hard to carry, but Kat. steadfastly refused to go, upon wh. he got abused by Karaitiana.—What vexes them now is, the probability of my going to reside among some other neighbouring tribe, &amp; thus they (as they say themselves) if they get no other Minister shall come to nothing.</p>
         <p>10. Sunday. Held the usual Services &amp; School, preaching in the mg. from 2 Tim. iv. 2–5; &amp; in the evg. from 2 Cor. vi. 7, 8. Renata, Karaitiana, Paul Muri and Katene present, the latter sitting with his back towards me; R. often made remarks in an undertone which I did not catch.</p>
         <p>See Journal, 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.—</p>
         <p>17. Lords day. Held the usual Services and School. Preached in the morning from Gen. xix. 9; in the evening from Gen. xxii. 1. Congn. 80. Te Moananui also, attended Service this day.</p>
         <p>22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Received a note this day from Karaitiana,<note xml:id="ftn1-123" place="foot" n="123"> WC: Karaitiana No. 12.</note> against any N. Teachers from other places coming here to hold Service; wh. I briefly ansd.<note xml:id="ftn1-124" place="foot" n="124"> WC: My answ. No. 13.</note> In the evening I recd. Jno. Mason Takihi, his brother, he having twice written to me very proper Letters declaring his sorrow, &amp;c., and as he was not an <hi rend="italic">active</hi> opposer I, after having talked to him, made up matters with him.—</p>
         <p>24. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lords</hi> Day. Held the usual Services &amp; School. Preached in the mg. from Gen. 27. 34; in evg. Eph. i. 13, 14. Cong. 122. Te Moananui and Paul Muri attended School this day, much to the vexation of all the other disaffd. ones. After mg. Service, L. said to Te Moanannui, “Na mou to kawau nei; <hi rend="italic">ko koe ano ko Ihau</hi>.” Te M. replied, “Ko koe ranei; ko te tangata nana te putake o te pohehe.”</p>
         <p>25. L. with his party left early this mg. for Manawatu;—their course being through the woods some miles to the right of the way,—none of the Xn. natives caring to speak a word to him. He told Te M. he should hahu &amp; bring away thence the bones of Te Wanikau; Te M. made no reply; but on being urged to speak, at last, he said, “Mau ra tena mahi; kua mutu hoki ta matou.” Te Moananui also, with Brown Te Heihei left this mg. for the Thames. Abm. &amp; Noah already seem quite happy, now that their little village is again become quiet.</p>
         <p>Thus my dear Sir I have endeavored to give you a faithful outline of the major facts down to the present date. Surely we may with St. Paul exclaim—2. Cor. i. 3, 10. I ought, perhaps, to have taken counsel of you ere I wrote to the Lt. Govr. Without doubt, I should have done so had you been nearer to me.—</p>
         <p>I have not time at present to add anything more—being also quite weary with so much writing.</p>
         <p>               And am</p>
         <p>                       my dear Archdn.</p>
