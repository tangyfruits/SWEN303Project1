         <p>Mr J. Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>During the past week I have more than once thought, that you may have been expecting to hear from me,—unless I had previously in­formed you of my long-wished for &amp; planned visit to the Bush;—where I had hoped to be at this time. But as your (or our) National Poet, Burns, truly says, just so have I experienced,— “the best laid schemes o’ mice and men Gang oft a-gley”;­—</p>
         <p>Our last meeting took place on the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> (I sent you a “D.T.” containing a brief account of it—though it was a lengthy one;—and all that week I <hi rend="italic">worked</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> (day &amp; night I may truly say), in getting off all our papers, official letters, specimens, entering minutes of meeting, of Council, entering letters, settling outstanding accounts, &amp;c, &amp;c, hoping <hi rend="italic">at</hi>
            <hi rend="underline"> </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to leave N on the Friday afternoon,—but that could not be &amp; I only fin­ished my letters, &amp;c, for Dr Hector late on Saturday night (14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) intending to start on the Tuesday;—</p>
         <p>On Sunday morning (15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) I was seized by my old foe—<hi rend="italic">Lumbago</hi>; and as I found it to be of no use resisting, I gave in, &amp; took to my bed—<hi rend="italic">taking the ugly thing there with me;</hi> I have not yet been out, or<hi rend="sup"> </hi>had my boots on, but I am wonderfully well again, &amp; hope to go to town tomorrow,—and as tomorrow is your mail day I write to you today; I hope to leave for the Bush on Friday next.—</p>
         <p>You will have seen from the “D.T.” that those worms you had sent me were shown, &amp; caused much interest, &amp; some wee bits of fear from the ladies.—</p>
         <p>Yours of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>, with the egg or capsule of those worms, I duly received and I have been watching the said egg ever since, but it is still the same. I think I must take it with me to ensure its<hi rend="sup"> </hi>safety &amp;c. If your good friend Mr Howlett<note xml:id="ftn3-166" place="foot" n="166"> William Howlett, at this time teacher at Makaretu school. See <hi rend="italic">Colenso’s collections</hi> p.404.</note> can get you one, or two more, without too much trouble, I should be glad to receive them.</p>
         <p>Miss Smiths little plant (you sent) is very common here, on the side of the path-way coming up from Milton Road,—&amp; generally<hi rend="sup"> </hi>throughout N.Z. also, in other Countries;—I exhibited a lot growing in a pot, at one of our meetings<hi rend="sup"> </hi>(see Trans Vol XII p 460, if<hi rend="sub"> </hi>you have that Vol) it is called <hi rend="italic">Drosera auriculata</hi>; but it is the <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> species, that are known (by ex­periment) to be insect eaters;­—</p>
         <p>I have been “grunting” a little at not being able to get to the woods to the <hi rend="italic">early</hi> spring flowers (some of which I greatly needed),—but it is well, perhaps, that I did not go early last week, as I have heard of plenty of rain up that way;—Here, we had a nice rain last night &amp; this mg which has done great good.</p>
         <p>I hope you are <hi rend="italic">all well</hi> &amp; that <hi rend="italic">you are doing well</hi>, &amp; with kind re­gards        Bel. me</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso.</p>
