         <p rend="end">Napier, Decr. 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1893</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>It is a long time since I last wrote to you (25 Nov.)—but I had <hi rend="italic">then </hi>determined I would not write again until your <hi rend="italic">busy </hi>time (election, &amp;c.) should be over, <hi rend="italic">and </hi>I also thought that I would write to you <hi rend="italic">this day.</hi>—But, oh—I have such a <hi rend="italic">lot </hi>to speak of, that I fear I may forget some, and not do justice to others: when down in town a few days ago I obtained the enclosed P.N. for £1., as a Xmas box for Victor &amp; the young Hardings, so please accept, &amp; dole out the same, as a good paterfamilias.—</p>
         <p>For some time past I have been putting up a rare dish of scraps of sorts for you—these will go w. this, in a small packet; only a <hi rend="italic">few </hi>(marked) to be retd. Among these 2 letters from Auckland w. my reply to 1 (having kept copy). I send these—(1) that you may see, I have had a <hi rend="italic">similar </hi>matter, as that of Eb. Baker of yr. city—and, I fear, have given great offence to Steele by my ansr. to <hi rend="italic">Malcolm</hi> I replied briefly—referring him to my letter, same subject, to his “<hi rend="italic">friend</hi>” S. M. replied, immy. on receipt, thanking me, &amp; begging a phot. (’65), &amp; saying, that S. would write in a day or two, however he has <hi rend="italic">not</hi>: &amp; 3 wks. ago I wrote to M. sending him a phot. (65), &amp; one for S. (’56:)—but <hi rend="italic">no </hi>acknt. to date!—There is also a P.C. from Xt.Ch., <hi rend="italic">re </hi>von Haast’s subsn.—and a circular from R.Sy.—I think I called yr. attention to the List of books pubd. by Didsy., &amp; among them one by Thompson (Dunedin) w. F.R.S. appd.—</p>
         <p>In the lot of sundries—notice, the <hi rend="italic">neat</hi> plan, &amp;c from Adelaide (greatly lauded by Craig, McD., &amp; others at our last Inst. Mtg.) <hi rend="italic">in </hi>the Cat. of Books, a veritable vol. on the <hi rend="italic">Sea Serpent</hi>!!—a no. sent to <hi rend="italic">me </hi>from America, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Dumb animals! containing a lot of <hi rend="italic">bosh</hi>: a peculiar no., also hailing from U.S., “Zoos”—(imperfect, too!) this is for dear Victor to amuse him.—The rest must speak for themselves. In my last I mentd. my going inland early in Decr. but the weather, &amp; <hi rend="italic">flood</hi>, &amp; broken up Railwy. Line hindered me: I go tomorrow (18) to Waipawa (only) on <hi rend="italic">business</hi>—too long delayed; absent about 2–3 days; and as Bp. is leaving us on 31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. Jany. I (of course) cannot well go away now, until “sports” &amp; holidays are over inland, &amp; the Bp. <hi rend="italic">goes</hi>: <hi rend="italic">then </hi>I hope to do so. All his furne. <hi rend="italic">Books, </hi>&amp;c &amp;c to be sold by Auction on 28<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Mont. L. Auctr. The Bp. called on me (in rain) on Friday, noon, to invite me to the Induction Service of Bradbury at Augs. on that evg.— “<hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>, if fine”: it <hi rend="italic">was so</hi>, &amp; I went.—On my return, <hi rend="italic">late</hi>, I found your letter of 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. &amp; <hi rend="italic">such </hi>a bulky lot of Wgn. P., sent by you (2 dz.) on my table, that I <hi rend="italic">wondered</hi>, but soon knew the cause &amp; <hi rend="italic">thank you </hi>for your great kindness &amp; <hi rend="italic">thoughtfulness</hi>, too, in this matter. I <hi rend="italic">fancy, </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi> wrote that notice of the Paper &amp; yr. Meeting. I have devoured <hi rend="italic">your graphic </hi>acct. of your Mtg. (in letter)—I suppose that Mair was <hi rend="italic">not </hi>there, <hi rend="italic">neither Mantell</hi>.—As you observe—it may not be pubd. in Trans., but <hi rend="italic">if so</hi>, could we get it retd. &amp; printed by you? Has yg. <hi rend="italic">von </hi>H. any infl. w. Committee (i.e. Council), (or w. <hi rend="italic">others</hi> who may have such infl.) I cod. write to <hi rend="italic">him </hi>urging him to come to the rescue of his Sire’s name. Give me your opin. Do you <hi rend="italic">know </hi>my <hi rend="underline italic">author</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">v. </hi>Tacitus <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Phœnix? <hi rend="italic">tell me</hi>. I agree w. you, in your remark, on Dr. H. (&amp; <hi rend="italic">others</hi>) laying hold of the <hi rend="italic">very opposite</hi>; long ago I had noticed <hi rend="italic">that</hi> in Dr. H., &amp;, in fact, it was my <hi rend="italic">plain speaking</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">anent </hi>it in L. to him, that brought about his <hi rend="italic">coolness</hi>, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>yr. enqy. “Old Maori Bible”—it is evidently <hi rend="italic">same </hi>as mine, wh. also (O.T.) ends on that <hi rend="italic">same </hi>nod. <hi rend="italic">page </hi>(910), ptd. by <hi rend="underline italic">Watts</hi> in 1868, &amp; the <hi rend="italic">whole </hi>bk, (O <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> N.T.) curiously ends w. page “1199”! I think I have a <hi rend="italic">spare</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">new</hi> copy I cod. <hi rend="italic">sell </hi>them: and, I may tell you, that I have found a <hi rend="italic">brand-new </hi>copy of <hi rend="underline italic">my</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">N.T.</hi>, <hi rend="italic">bound too in calf</hi>!!—for which I must find a <hi rend="italic">good niche</hi>—B. Museum, or yr. Genl. Liby., or (<hi rend="italic">anon</hi>) sell at a <hi rend="underline italic">good fig</hi>. This subject leads me to mention what I have often thought of doing, viz. of sending to Genl. Liby. copies of all <hi rend="italic">our </hi>pubs. here, through you—tell me what you think of it.—I have lately recd. several parcels of books from Home (most not yet opened!)—one Cook’s 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. V. from his log, &amp;c—a ponderous 4to., 400 pp. ptd. on <hi rend="italic">thick </hi>paper uncut, w. most uneven <hi rend="italic">fore</hi>-edge, and by no means prepossg. <hi rend="italic">prim. facie</hi>! I have dipped into it, &amp; am <hi rend="italic">greatly </hi>dissd.—<hi rend="italic">too much </hi>of E.N.E. N.N.W., alt. decl. winds, compass bgs., &amp;c &amp;c—and we are told it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> bona fide Cook’s, but written (suppd.) by his Clerk (<hi rend="italic">Orton</hi>!) w. C’s. marginl. obsns. <hi rend="italic">Less </hi>of their landf. &amp;c. at Py. Bay than we knew before, (Give me Hawkes.’ &amp; Parkinson’s) only a few plates, (copies of <hi rend="italic">former </hi>ones, but badly done, &amp; so the maps &amp; charts! Inty, w. small &amp; confused names,) the Compiler (or copier) speaks of <hi rend="italic">Banks’ </hi>as giving <hi rend="italic">much </hi>informn. (and <hi rend="italic">so </hi>Sir J. Hooker,) &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">that</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> I hope yet to see</hi>. In his life of C.—the Editor—Capt. Wharton, R.N., F.R.S., &amp;c &amp;c—begins, “James Cook rose from nearly the lowest ranks”—&amp; ever &amp; anon Wharton keeps <hi rend="italic">this </hi>in view! Still there are interesting bits in it. <hi rend="italic">The Marines </hi>(as P. says) were landed in form at P. Bay:—&amp; on leaving Mcy. Bay, they <hi rend="italic">cut that inscriptn </hi>&amp; left it.—<hi rend="italic">note below </hi>give the mad. sp. of Mao. names! but, alas! by some creature who does not know Maori. Strange! C. has left no descendants: he had 6; 3 died yg.; of the others (all boys), eldest, Jas. entd. R.N. &amp; rose to be a Commander, drowned in 1794: the second Nathaniel (also in R.N.) lost in hurricane in 1780: the 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. died at Cambridge—none were married.—Wharton closes his “<hi rend="italic">Life of Ck.</hi>”, with a good par. “Well may Engd. be proud that this greatest of navigators was their countryman”. The Ed. has kept in, <hi rend="italic">bad </hi>gramr. &amp; <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> orthogy (!) as he found it—remkg. such <hi rend="italic">not </hi>of Ck’s. own doing, as <hi rend="italic">all his </hi>letters were invariably correctly written. (!!) I had 5 parcels sent by one Eng. M., but provokingly one the biggest is missing! <hi rend="italic">1</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">st</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. vol. </hi>of “Index Kewensis” (Botl.) large 4to. have made many enqs.</p>
         <p>I have had a <hi rend="italic">strange </hi>Visitor on Friday. Last wk., in town <hi rend="italic">Hoben </hi>(!!!) accosted me—a gentm. from Melbourne wished to see me <hi rend="italic">re </hi>ferns, &amp;c, &amp; that <hi rend="italic">H.</hi> wod. escort him! so they came in rain. A Mr. Sass, &amp; certy. he is a nice well-edd. yg. man,well up in <hi rend="italic">Ferns</hi>, having a large Fernery at M. They called rather late (near iv.) but we spent a <hi rend="italic">pleasant </hi>hour, he had been to Whi. &amp; seen &amp; <hi rend="italic">heard old Field</hi>! he leaves tomorrow for Auckland—I put up “Ruahine”, &amp; another, w. a few of our rarest <hi rend="italic">small </hi>ferns for him, yesty. aftn. &amp; sent to Masonic. Hoben behaved very well—<hi rend="italic">here</hi>. I had sent of my new lot of <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi> to Kew, last mo. since, engd. on <hi rend="italic">Lichens</hi> &amp; now taken up <hi rend="italic">Mosses</hi>—a <hi rend="italic">long </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">tough</hi> job, being the collns. from 1880! I have also been keeping <hi rend="italic">another </hi>“Jubilee” (quietly &amp; <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>!) viz. the day of my <hi rend="italic">first </hi>treading H. Bay soil: and, (D.V.) I have others coming-on!—Last wk. I called on Dr. Sp. (1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. for ’93,) on leaving by Hosp. Bus my 2 hands were grasped—1 by a lady, &amp; 1 by a gent. unknown to me! However, they proved to be <hi rend="italic">Purvis </hi>R. &amp; wife!! (<hi rend="italic">She a nice </hi>pleasant person, &amp; P. much <hi rend="italic">altered </hi>for the better (<hi rend="italic">older</hi>, of course, &amp;c.) we chatted all the way to Hoadley’s. You have seen <hi rend="italic">re </hi>our elections—I was ill-used at Hastings, &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">felt it</hi>. Fitzroy came out to take the Sergeant’s first, &amp; to tell me—I should have kept a <hi rend="italic">better look </hi>out, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Suppy. Roll. of <hi rend="italic">names struck out</hi>; but, as Ed. Herald aftds. told F., my name, or <hi rend="italic">no</hi>., was <hi rend="italic">not </hi>inserted there!! I lost my time, my money, and my temper—having to wait 1h. &amp; 15m. <hi rend="italic">in Ry. Stat. Verandah</hi>! for a return train, &amp; so got knocked up.</p>
         <p>I suppose you know all or <hi rend="italic">enough re </hi>our floods: it was severe &amp; disastrous and <hi rend="italic">ruinous </hi>to many!—I can well sympathise w. them—having expd. such, and that on sevl. occasions during residence on the <hi rend="italic">low</hi> flat, 1844–62, and <hi rend="italic">the flood of ’45</hi> was a bigger one that this: and I <hi rend="underline italic">alone</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>as to White residents. With you (&amp; many others) I mourn over <hi rend="italic">Douglas</hi>! I liked him: he was buried at Taradale, Grant &amp; Fraser at the funeral.—Paterson gone S. w. £50. <hi rend="underline italic">bonus</hi> in pocket,—Morrison is now at St Pauls. Lascelles’ loss is sd. to be very heavy (“<hi rend="italic">£1000</hi>”) which he cannot well bear. I thought on yr. Father, but did not know his exact locality, &amp; scarcely ventured on hilltop to reconnoitre; have been out <hi rend="italic">but little</hi> of late—once in 3 wks. to town.</p>
         <p>Here I must stop. I enclose p. stamps to pay for papers sent w. postages. You did <hi rend="italic">not </hi>say how Victor was—hope the dear boy is better. I heartily wish Mrs. Harding &amp; yourself a Happy N. Year, also, <hi rend="italic">all good </hi>to the bairnies—If. this mo. (as you say) should prove to be a “<hi rend="italic">slack</hi>” one—then write up, but I would rather hear of yr. prospects for this new Y. being good.—</p>
         <p>With kindest regards, Believe me ever,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
