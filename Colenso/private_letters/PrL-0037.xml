         <p rend="end">Victoria,<lb/>Monday<lb/>May 8th.</p>
         <p>My dear friend,</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">We</hi> arrived here yesterday—48 hours from the Thames. Through Mrs. B’s. kind and pressing invitation, we remain here for the present. My good wife is pretty well and joins me in sending our kind regards to Mr. and Mrs. Mair and family.</p>
         <p>I saw the Bishop at Auckland, on Thursday night last; and had some conversation with His Lordship. He was 13 days coming from Waimate, by way of Kaipara. He intends returning to the Bay by way of Wangarei and, Ngunguru, and I ventured to assure him that you would do all you could to assist him, and put him in your boat to Ngunguru,—I mean to Kaiwa Bay, whence he could get in 3 or 4 hours to Capt. L’s.—I hope the Natives will huihui, and behave well to His Lordship, and remember Neho their old matua.</p>
         <p>As soon as he returns We are to go to the Waimate, when I hope to write you again.</p>
         <p>Mr. Chris. Davies is at Paihia for the benefit of his health. The Tortoise is here taking in stores, and going home—now is the time to write your father. Capt. Todd is here in the Union—and the Westminster, another merchant ship, is here also; and 6 or 8 whalers—ka pai ha!</p>
         <p>I send your daughters watch, and wishing you every blessing—and desiring to whisper, (in love and friendship,) <hi rend="italic">make sure work for eternity</hi>—</p>
         <p>       I am,</p>
         <p>               My dear friend,</p>
         <p>                       with the kindest regards to<hi rend="italic">all</hi>
         </p>
         <p>                               Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>                                       W. Colenso.</p>
