         <p rend="end">Tuesday Morng.</p>
         <p rend="end">Porangahau</p>
         <p>My dear Mr. McLean</p>
         <p>It occurred to me last night, that, while a probability existed of the Chiefs being unwilling to consent to my going to Manawarakau, they would not be so greatly unfavorable to my going <hi rend="italic">to Waimarama</hi>. Seeing too, that this had been agreed to <hi rend="underline italic">publicly</hi>
      by <hi rend="italic">them before the Archdn.</hi>&amp; myself, &amp; had only been set aside on the score of ₤100. being demanded by Hapuku.—Now I think—on reconsidering the matter—that, in many respects, W.marama is preferable to M.rakau—I should be much more <hi rend="italic">central</hi> to those at N. &amp; W. of me.—And this spot you can boldly speak on without any fear of arousing unnecessary suspicions—as they <hi rend="underline italic">now</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">know I</hi> cannot legally purchase their land. If you could <hi rend="underline italic">see</hi> that little glen (which Mrs Colenso has seen) &amp; purchase it for me—10 acres of it, as a Missy. Station—&amp; the remr.—no large qy.—I would <hi rend="italic">purchase</hi> immediately of the Government. I feel almost sure this could be done directly—it has <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> boundaries &amp; “<hi rend="italic">no mistake</hi>.”</p>
         <p>Please confer with Mrs Colenso on the matter, &amp; if you can settle it, <hi rend="underline italic">do so</hi>.</p>
         <p>       Ever yrs truly</p>
         <p>               W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Hapuku’s demanding ₤100 was merely a pretext to break <hi rend="italic">his word</hi>, hoping to keep me by him: the glen can be of no use to any European settler.</p>
