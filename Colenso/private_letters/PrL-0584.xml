         <p rend="end">Napier Saturday night <lb/>Dec 6th 1884</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Though very tired with so much heavy writing all this week (for foreign mails), yet I think it better to delay no longer replying to your welcome note of Nov 30th, that came with spns on the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> (Tuesday). I was glad to see your writing &amp; packet (as I always am) although I knew you had been, &amp; still were necessarily busy. I was delighted when I opened the tin &amp; found your little beauties smiling &amp; looking charm­ing; we seemed to know each other. (Judge Gillies, who was here last night was greatly pleased with them; I don’t think he had seen any of the Ge­nus before). They were not however new; &amp; though varying in size were­ all 4 of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> species—the same as you had sent me last year, &amp; descri­bed at p. 337, “Trans” Vol XVI <hi rend="italic">Corysanthes papillosa</hi> (see p.8 “In Memoriam” for a notice of the described species). The other little plant (no 3 on Zinc) is also known, &amp; described in Hand Book p.285, <hi rend="italic">Arthropodium can­didum</hi> Raoul, (though R did not <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">find</hi> it, &amp; send it home. I did, near Tolaga Bay, many years before; but Hooker delayed its publication, through being absent in India). It grows <hi rend="italic">solitarily</hi>—in the shady &amp; cliffy (Mossy) sides of ravines, &amp; streams; <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, I think, “frequent in woods”, as Hooker says in Hd Bk, (but there are many mistakes of that kind,) I was also interested in the wrapping Moss, about them; unfor­tinately they were all <hi rend="italic">barren</hi>; there was one Moss in particular with fine &amp; large green leaves, that I would like to get good spns of, as I <hi rend="italic">fancy</hi> it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be <hi rend="italic">new</hi>,—we have 2 species of the Genus described (and there are many others all over the world). I enclose a scrap of it—there were only a few scraps like this one, but there are plenty (no doubt) where it grew. Young Chambers sent me some of it (also <hi rend="italic">barren</hi> and mixed up with other Mosses,) 2–3 years back. Just put this scrap in a little water &amp; you will see how its leaves expand.</p>
         <p>The proper season is, I fear, too far gone for <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Mosses in fruit, but should you at any time fall in with any, gather &amp; send; these plants re­quire no extra care; just wrap up loosely, in a bit of paper <hi rend="italic">any how</hi> (like tobacco) but their little hats, caps, or helmets, should be sent with them, for much depends on its cap,—nearly all being <hi rend="italic">dissimilar.</hi> I hope to work at our <hi rend="italic">Mosses</hi> shortly, for which I have been making large pre­parations!!.</p>
         <p>I shall post with this a copy of the Official Parly. Paper about the Mao Lexicon, for your library; as I much wish the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> to be known; and I must also <hi rend="italic">present</hi> a copy of Vol I “Trans”—tho rather scarce &amp; dear in a guinea. If my sending it to <hi rend="italic">Puketapu</hi> by Rymer <hi rend="italic">would do, I could send it there, well.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>As the season advances, dinna forget those 2 very long stalked Orchids, with a few small flowers at top, you sent me last Autumn in <hi rend="italic">Spirits</hi>;<note xml:id="ftn3-277" place="foot" n="277">
               <hi rend="italic">Prasophyllum variegatum</hi> Col. = <hi rend="italic">Corunastylis nuda</hi>.</note> They were however, too far gone, &amp; you said you would look out for more this season. I have recd one <hi rend="italic">wee</hi>, <hi rend="italic">new</hi> plant from Mr Hill,<note xml:id="ftn3-278" place="foot" n="278">
               <hi rend="italic">Pterostylis tristis</hi> Col. = <hi rend="italic">Hymenochilus tristis</hi>.</note> &amp; have been working on it. And now my dear Sir, I must conclude with very kind regards, Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Tuesday 9th evening. In town this morning I endeavoured to learn from the Post Office, about the mail to you, &amp; so on. I am told it leaves at 3.30 for Puketapu; so I shall try tomorrow to send you your book so far; and if I do not succeed, will keep it till I hear from you. Showery again today</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
