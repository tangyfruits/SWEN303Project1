         <p>Dear Hans Mortensen</p>
         <p>Last night I received your kind (though <hi rend="italic">sad</hi>) letter of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and the news you give me of the death of your brother-in-law John Frederickson has caused me to <hi rend="italic">sorrow </hi>with <hi rend="italic">you all</hi>. It must have been a heavy and unexpected blow and trouble, may <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> give you all grace to bear it <hi rend="italic">without murmuring</hi>: it is easy to say “Thy will be done,” but not so easy to hear it when the time of trial comes: Paul found it to be so (2 Corinthians, 12 <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, 8, 9 <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.) and prayed for strength: and so our Lord in Gethsemane—that the bitter cup might pass away—but ending with, “Not my will but Thine be done” and was, also, <hi rend="italic">strengthened</hi> in that he feared (Heb. 5, 7, 8) It is often <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> to flesh &amp; blood, my dear friend, but we are called on to follow—to endure, as a dear old Hymn says—<lb/>  “Christ leads me through no darker rooms,<lb/>  Than he went through before;<lb/>  He that unto God’s Kingdom comes<lb/>  Must enter by this door.”——</p>
         <p>Bishop Williams’ aged mother died lately, and this hymn was sung at her funeral—–<lb/>  “Brief life is here our portion,<note xml:id="ftn3-801" place="foot" n="801"> The letter ends here, but the funerary hymn goes on... “Brief life is here our portion, brief sorrow, short lived care; the life that knows no ending, the tearless life, is there. There grief is turned to pleasure; such pleasure as below, no human voice can utter, no human heart can know.”—Words: Bernard of Cluny, 1145; trans. John Mason Neale, 1851.</note>
