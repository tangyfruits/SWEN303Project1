         <p rend="end">(Duplicate)<lb/>Waitangi, Hawke’s Bay,<lb/>January 20, 1846.</p>
         <p rend="end">Rev. J.P. Gell,<lb/>  &amp;c &amp;c<lb/>C.M.  Hobart.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Believing that, ere this, you will have seen some late numbers of Sir W.J. Hooker’s “Icones Plantarum,” and of Dr. Joseph Hooker’s “Antarctic Botany” in which my name is mentioned as having published a description of cuta in <hi rend="italic">filices novæs</hi> in the Tasmanian Journal, and which publication is in those works referred to as a kind of authority for such plants—I venture to write you, hoping that you will not deem it an annoyance in my requesting you to procure me copies of the numbers of that work containing the Descriptions <hi rend="italic">above referred to</hi>, as well as my rambling Journey into the Interior, supposing the same to have been published: or, if that work has been discontinued (which I almost conclude to have been the case) to send me back those Mss., with a note from yourself as editor at the period when those papers were written and sent to Hobart, stating the <hi rend="italic">time </hi>when they were received and the reason why they were not published. I am the more constrained to exert myself in this matter, because, some other Botanists have subsequently described those Ferns, &amp;c., whose synonyms Sir W.J. Hooker has kindly set aside, referring to my <hi rend="italic">prior</hi> publication: it is, therefore, incumbent upon me to make some enquiry in the matter, and not knowing the gentleman on whom the Editorial department may have devolved after you, I am necessitated, as it were, to make this application.—</p>
         <p>I think I wrote you a short note in March last from Wellington, which perhaps never reached you.—</p>
         <p>Having been so much in correspondence with Hobart in connexion with our Journal, several of the Members residing here—Major Richmond, Dr. Sinclair, Revds. Taylor and Maunsell, &amp; others—look to me for some information concerning the same, which I am not able to give. I mention this, my dear Sir, as a further apology (if needed) for my intruding upon you <hi rend="italic">again</hi> in this matter.—</p>
         <p>Here, in a new Station in this all but unknown part of N. Zealand—I have too much to do to attend to Botanical researches: yet I have in my lonely wanderings among the Natives—or rather in searching after them—detected several new and curious (if not lovely) additions to the Botany of N.Z., which I hope in time will find their way to England.</p>
         <p>I know I know little of what is going on at Auckland, or the N. parts of the Islands: my last information was dated September. We are sometimes 6 months without hearing from those quarters, and without seeing a white face!—happily the horrors of war have not yet caused any Commotion in this neighbourhood.</p>
         <p>As I much wish for this note to reach you without loss of time, and as I have to send many days overland by Natives ere it can be posted at any of the towns, I have, in order to guard against any casualty, written to you in duplicate: the original I sent via Auckland, this I shall send via Wellington.<note xml:id="ftn1-66" place="foot" n="66"> Apparently both arrived: they are among the Gunn papers; they differ only in detail.</note>
         </p>
         <p>Please when you write, direct to the care of Rev. R. Cole, M.A. Parsonage, Wellington.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Very faithfully yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
