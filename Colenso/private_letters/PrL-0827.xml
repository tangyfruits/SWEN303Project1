         <p rend="end">Dannevirke<lb/>April 21 1892</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Hading</p>
         <p>I will no longer put you off!</p>
         <p>I have only <hi rend="italic">now </hi>(XI a.m.) broken the seal of your last letter—of the 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. &amp; recd. by me on 12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>—&amp; then, through my <hi rend="italic">not </hi>being able to keep an appointment!</p>
         <p>I will try to explain—briefly.—–</p>
         <p>But <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, yours, tho’ <hi rend="underline italic">specially good</hi>, is <hi rend="italic">not </hi>(as I take it) <hi rend="italic">a reply to my last.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On recg. yours I was <hi rend="italic">doubly </hi>busy: so many letters (&amp; daily increasing!) unanswered, &amp;, at the same time, six sermons to prepare for within 8 days: spns. of plants, insects, &amp;c sent in for information, Govt. forms to fill in,—Eng Mail (aye &amp; Am. one, too, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>!) <hi rend="italic">reqg. attention</hi>—to say nothing of other minor matters, including weakness &amp; inability from the dregs of La Grippe! &amp;c—————</p>
         <p>So I put yours aside, until <hi rend="italic">after </hi>E. Mail Day (yesty. <hi rend="italic">here</hi>:—and lo! <hi rend="italic">another </hi>&amp; most unexpected—hindrance, in a letter from the Bp. informing me of the arrival of a Dr. Leitch from Edinburgh a great friend of his, &amp; zealous <hi rend="italic">Botanist</hi>, who came by “Arawa” &amp; would return by her! on 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., who was leaving N. for Taupo Auckland, &amp;c, &amp; would be sure to come on purposely to Dvk. to see me (having been stirred up to do so by his, the Bishop’s, daughter) to go w. him into the forests—collg. Ferns!!! I, who have not been thither since Septr. last! However I <hi rend="italic">hoped </hi>this Dr. would <hi rend="italic">not </hi>find me out, seeing he had to go N., &amp; then S. But at Woodville, last Thursday evg., Hill burst in on me, &amp; told me, he had clinched the nail, &amp; the Dr. would be sure to be here, on 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., &amp; sure enough, he came! and I had to go w. him into the nearest wood from 2 to 4 p.m. in pain &amp; misery (wh. tho he saw he did not care for—either from his professional hardening, or his zeal for Botany—) when we returned together—he carrying his many treasures &amp; happy—I my loads of pain &amp; heavy dark thoughts arising from my present weak physical state, &amp; that re-acting on mind, causing me to forget the names &amp;c &amp;c of common things around us.—However, I to my couch; he to his room to put up his stores, &amp; then at VI. with me to get them (ferns) <hi rend="italic">named</hi>—this I manage to do having H’s. HdBk. N.Z. Flora <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, tho’ unused for a long time: but he got me yesty. to prom. to go out w. him this mg.—which <hi rend="italic">I could not do</hi>—but shall try once more, at 2 p.m. &amp; so, having got rid of him, I opened your <hi rend="italic">prized </hi>letter—which, like boys eating plum-cake and keeping the biggest tit-bit for last!—I had so <hi rend="italic">stored</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I find from the Dr.—that Mrs Hill had promised to be w. him <hi rend="italic">here</hi>: &amp; H. was here on Tuesday nt. by <hi rend="italic">late </hi>train, &amp; left by <hi rend="italic">early</hi> N. train yesty. mg. VII.45, (for, I <hi rend="italic">suppose</hi>, Makotuku,) &amp; likely returning today. This Dr. is an enthusiastic Botanist—knows Brit. Boty. (<hi rend="italic">I see</hi>) &amp; has lots of things w. him, as drying papers, vasculums, presses, &amp;c. workg.—well, <hi rend="italic">like yourself</hi>, heartily: &amp; seeing all this, &amp; knowing he has but a few days in N.Z. stirs me the more, <hi rend="italic">when even my desires to aid throws me back! </hi>Oh! dear, I <hi rend="italic">feel it</hi>.—He has letters to folks S.—XtCh. Dunedin &amp;c &amp;c, &amp; will see them all! &amp; being a very Hercules (or son of Anak) in size &amp; in strength, &amp; (appy.) in health, he <hi rend="italic">cannot enter into my wretched short-comings</hi>. To my astonishment, he told me, how freqy. he had stopped the Coach (the complaisant John helping!) to dismount &amp; gather ferns, on his way hither: he had also bought a box of dried ones of Craig, Auckland, &amp;c, &amp;c. But you will have had eno. of <hi rend="italic">my </hi>Dr.!</p>
         <p>Last wk. (Thursday for G. Fy.) returning to Woodville for 5–6 days wk.,—Mrs Hill, Craig &amp; wife, Fannin &amp; son, &amp; others, were fellow-passgrs—bent on their holiday—to Whanganui, &amp;c—all leaving on G. Fy. morning.</p>
         <p>Having recd. <hi rend="italic">living </hi>insects, “blights,” twice by mail from N. reqg. replies, &amp; not having Books nor microscope here, I sent them on to Maskell, &amp; yesty. recd. a very kind reply from him: he too, is, &amp; has long been, unwell: he says vol. __ will be <hi rend="italic">late </hi>this yr. owing to delay on plates.—</p>
         <p>Remr. me very kindly to Koch, when you see him: your relation (from him) of his shave in civil war (barricades), reminds me of an argument I once witnessed ’tween him &amp; Weber <hi rend="italic">re </hi>same:—which K. capped by telling W., that <hi rend="italic">he </hi>was on the <hi rend="italic">wrong side</hi>!—</p>
         <p>You are right my friend in your practical remarks re preaching coupled w. this moving about to perform same in all weathers—crowdings in trains—and <hi rend="italic">no </hi>help from Porters, &amp;c—loss of baggage (viz. my 2 cloaks—which however I got back after <hi rend="italic">much trouble</hi>, &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
         <p>After long continuance of fine &amp; warm weather the G. Fy. &amp; Easter Season was a mis. cold &amp; wet one! I managed to get through all the services—but had to endure much from cold—espy. at the <hi rend="italic">hotel</hi> there. Robertshawe goes thither next Sunday &amp; I <hi rend="italic">here </hi>in his place. I did hope to go to Napier on Mondy. next, mainly to bring up work for myself—i.e. in Maori Lex. matter (resumé III) &amp; for papers on Hawaiki &amp; Greenstone Myths, &amp;c—but I fear Capt. R. is at XtCh. Races—&amp; if so I may defer my going to N. It suits me better to go, <hi rend="italic">after </hi>a Sy. S. <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, than after one at Wdv.</p>
         <p>Thanks for retg. my letter to you—I will send it back anon: I notice (just as I had supposed) sevl. points therein, <hi rend="underline italic">untouched by you</hi>—this <hi rend="italic">I did not expect</hi>.</p>
         <p>Sorry to hear of your loss of <hi rend="italic">that </hi>ptg. work: <hi rend="underline italic">Glad</hi> to hear of Victor’s improvet. Excuse this. </p>
         <p>Very kindest &amp; best old love &amp; regards. </p>
         <p>Yours always, </p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Have just dipped into “Morris”—<hi rend="italic">anon.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>P.S. This old machine can only get along—a little longer—by moving in its <hi rend="italic">old </hi>grooves.</p>
         <p>Hope &amp; intend to write again shortly.</p>
