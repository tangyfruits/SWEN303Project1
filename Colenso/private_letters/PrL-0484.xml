         <p rend="end">Napier, Feby. 8<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> 1882.</p>
         <p>My dr Capt. Russell,</p>
         <p>I was a wee bit disappointed in not being able to have a word w. you in private on My. last—wh. I had hoped for.</p>
         <p>I wished to have yr. opinion about writing to Mr. Rolleston to remind him of his promises re. those spn. pp. of the M. Lexn. Whether we (both) should write? or you alone? or I alone? Of course you (who had so often <hi rend="italic">seen </hi>him) know the exact posn. of your private acquaintance, &amp;c.—I am of opin., that you shod. write (you might say, on my reqg. you to do so) &amp; that I, also, shod. write:—just to remind him of his (2) offl. promises to me, &amp; my patient waiting. I may also add, that in my replies to enquiries from <hi rend="italic">abroad</hi>, last year, I had said, that Mr. R. had promised , &amp; I was then expectg. his fulfilment.</p>
         <p>I have heard from an acquaintance at the N., that Mr R. had been written to offy. upon the same subj. from that locality.</p>
         <p>If convenient let me have an early line from you.—</p>
         <p>             Hoping you are well<lb/>                                        I am<lb/>                                               Yrs sincerely<lb/>                                                      WC.</p>
