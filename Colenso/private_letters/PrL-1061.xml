         <p rend="end">Napier, New Zealand,<lb/>October 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1898.</p>
         <p>My dear nephew William</p>
         <p>My last letter to you was on 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. August, written from Waipukurau, where I was then staying. I suppose you have received it in the week just passed. This day I have written <hi rend="italic">officially</hi> to the Mayor &amp; Corporation, enclosing 3 Drafts (₤<hi rend="italic">500</hi>: ₤<hi rend="italic">300</hi>: ₤<hi rend="italic">200</hi> = ₤<hi rend="italic">1000</hi>) drawn <hi rend="italic">payable to Mr. Julyan as Mayor and to you as B. Councillor</hi>—<hi rend="italic">and representing me</hi>: I only got the money yesterday (the day on which the <hi rend="italic">fixed deposits </hi>became due), so have lost no time about it. You will see, and note, what I have said in my official letter to you all. I thought it best to tell the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> as to my being only a man of <hi rend="italic">moderate means </hi>for several reasons—to stop others from thinking I am <hi rend="italic">rich</hi>! my Income has for 3–4 years been fast diminishing—<hi rend="italic">mainly </hi>owing to interest having so steadily gone down: formerly 8 per cent, then 6, 5, &amp; now <hi rend="italic">3 in Banks</hi>, and rates &amp; taxes terribly increasing! A case happened <hi rend="italic">to me</hi> this last week: I have a 5 acre paddock at Waipawa, this was formerly let at ₤18. a year—then let at ₤15. (on lease), last year after 12 months hanging on hand, I let it at ₤<hi rend="italic">12</hi>. the <hi rend="italic">taker </hi>(as in former cases) paying the Rates &amp; taxes, 13/4 per ann.;—to my <hi rend="italic">surprise</hi>, last week a letter from him, saying,—the Rates &amp; taxes had increased from 13/4 to ₤<hi rend="italic">12.15.0</hi> &amp; so he must give it up—leaving me to pay those extortionate demands! You may ask, <hi rend="italic">How can that be</hi>? Under the <hi rend="italic">new </hi>Act, of rating on <hi rend="italic">Unimproved</hi> value: by this a paddock (or land near a township) is valued (generally by a <hi rend="italic">worthless </hi>wretch, an underling of the Govt.) at a <hi rend="italic">fictitious </hi>value—of what it <hi rend="italic">might</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be, <hi rend="italic">worth</hi>, if cut up into small (⅛th. ac. sections) for villa residences; but in <hi rend="italic">many </hi>instances there is <hi rend="italic">no </hi>demand for such, as in this case, and so, I suppose, I shall be again <hi rend="italic">driven</hi> to sell it at what it may bring at auction: it was the same here in Napier—the Tax Commissioner’s men, valued some of my town sections (all I had remaining) in a similar way: I appealed, again &amp; again, year after year, in vain: ₤<hi rend="italic">300</hi>. pr. section was their valuation—after 2 years worry I got it reduced to ₤250: it was the old story, of a “horse eating its head off.” I, at last, sold <hi rend="italic">all </hi>I had in town here at auction—on low easy terms, ⅓rd. at purchase, ⅓rd. at 6 months, and ⅓rd. at 12 months, <hi rend="italic">without Interest</hi>, and I <hi rend="italic">advertised </hi>them <hi rend="italic">all</hi> at a <hi rend="italic">low </hi>upset price: those ₤250. ones, at ₤20.—they only brought ₤26:—sale over I sent in a <hi rend="italic">full</hi> account to the Tax Commissioner—of course, to <hi rend="italic">no avail</hi> (perhaps only laughed at!) and then, he enquired, “What I did with the money received?” and demanded Tax on the <hi rend="italic">Py</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, though they pd. me <hi rend="underline italic">no</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> Int.</hi>—and I was obliged to pay it!! I hope and trust I shall have enough money to carry me well through life, <hi rend="italic">without dipping </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">deep</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>into principal, now nearly all in <hi rend="italic">Banks</hi>—but if anything happened to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>! (and such <hi rend="italic">may,</hi>) <hi rend="italic">I shall feel it</hi>. I <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> worry &amp; care over money, or land; owing to the Editors of Papers out here republishing in their papers about <hi rend="italic">this </hi>“<hi rend="italic">₤1000</hi>,” copied from Home Papers, I have been troubled with many applications from Ministers (at a distance) to help them—in paying debts on their churches, &amp;c, &amp;c., &amp; <hi rend="italic">have refused all</hi>: telling some of them a bit of my mind. Were I the <hi rend="italic">rich </hi>person I am supposed to be, I would keep a man &amp; horse &amp; buggy: but I cannot do that <hi rend="underline italic">and</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> give to the poor</hi>—&amp; so I choose the latter. I believe moreover, that at Home—at Penzance, there are such erroneous notions—even held by <hi rend="italic">Willie &amp; Sarah</hi>! &amp; perhaps others: Latimer, who was out here 2 yeas ago, <hi rend="italic">knows better</hi>.—–</p>
         <p>I received, at <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">note</hi> from Mr. Julyan, (in reply to <hi rend="italic">my long and friendly loving letter</hi>) but it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> such as I expected—indeed, not a reply at all, (but let that pass.) I have written to him, privately, this day: and have told him, he made <hi rend="italic">too much </hi>in Council of my mention of a remark from Penz. 3 years ago about the former investment: for I had never found fault with it, and had told my informant, that I had entrusted it wholly to the Mayor &amp; Corporation, &amp; had been satisfied: and so in this case I cannot suppose they (you all) will do any other than what is right.—Mr. Julyan says, referring to the copy of my little book on “Errors of Rome” I had sent him, that <hi rend="italic">he had no time to read it</hi>, and that there <hi rend="italic">are worse spiritual errors than Popery</hi>: I have, in reply, remarked,—that, likely, he supposed my book was merely the <hi rend="italic">old &amp; common</hi> cry—but that it was <hi rend="italic">my own experience</hi> of 50 years &amp; more, &amp; its <hi rend="italic">historical relations</hi> make it interesting &amp; valuable to <hi rend="italic">us </hi>here in the Colony.—–and as to <hi rend="italic">popery </hi>I <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> with our holy martyred forefathers— “the Ch. of Rome is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Church of Xt.”—–</p>
         <p>Our annual Ch. Synod was held last week—and during its session <hi rend="italic">I told them</hi> the <hi rend="italic">above</hi> concerning Rome—giving them chap’ &amp; verse from the <hi rend="italic">standard </hi>works of our chiefest Divines, with extracts from the Articles, &amp;c, of <hi rend="italic">our Church</hi>,—I fancy I astonished some of the young ones! I gave it <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> to a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> of our ministers who go in for Ritualism (in a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> way—at <hi rend="italic">present</hi>), telling the most advanced &amp; forward one—<hi rend="italic">he had better go to Rome</hi>. And this I did as <hi rend="italic">the old man</hi> of the Synod; and as, possibly, <hi rend="italic">never again appearing there among them</hi>. Our doings in Synod are <hi rend="italic">barely</hi> mentioned in our papers! however I attended every day: thank <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>.</p>
         <p>I sent you (&amp; Willie &amp; Richard) some papers by last weeks Mail, from them you would learn I had been <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>: I am well, &amp; daily <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> something—for I <hi rend="italic">love </hi>work and have <hi rend="italic">no </hi>society. No doubt some of my Ch. brethren were displeased at the plainness &amp; freedom of my remarks, and they certainly showed it by <hi rend="italic">not </hi>calling on me—as on former occasions: but I was strongly cheered in Synod.</p>
         <p>The weather here is fine, the Races (2 days), and the Show Fair of Cattle, &amp;c, (2 days) are held this week. Of course, I wish you to act with Mr. Julyan, cordially, in the matter of drawing the money.</p>
         <p>I trust you &amp; yours, &amp; <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the family are well, I will (D.V.) write <hi rend="italic">you</hi> again next month, &amp; send for <hi rend="italic">Ellen.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>May God bless &amp; keep you.</p>
         <p>Believe me, Your loving Uncle</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
