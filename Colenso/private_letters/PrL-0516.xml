         <p>Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>In sending you our read papers, I would fain say a word that <hi rend="italic">you should know</hi> why there are none from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> this year on the old Maoris: seeing, too, that I had <hi rend="italic">not finished my “Contributions”</hi>, and had some papers in continuation begun last year. All I can <hi rend="italic">at present</hi> say is, that <hi rend="italic">it is not my fault</hi>, very very far from that: to be obliged to drop my work has been a sad blow to me, and I still feel it: more at present I cannot say,—except, that it is quite possible I may never write again any more of such papers for our Branch Institute. (Tempus omnia revelat.)</p>
         <p>After hearing Mr. Locke read his <hi rend="italic">first</hi> paper, in August, I informed him privately, that a very large portion of it had been long ago published, by Sir. G. Grey, Taylor, myself, &amp; others. His <hi rend="italic">second</hi> paper is only <hi rend="italic">just to hand</hi>, in time to be forwarded to you; I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> looked into it.—</p>
         <p>You cannot help noticing how <hi rend="italic">irregularly</hi> my paper on Nomenclature is written (especially when compared with my former ones), that is owing to the trying ordeal (mental) I have had to go through.——</p>
         <p>     Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>             W. Colenso.</p>
