         <p rend="end">Napier April 24 1868</p>
         <p>Dr. Julius Haast, F.G.S.,<lb/>&amp;c  &amp;c  &amp;c<lb/>Ct.Church,<lb/>Canterbury, N.Z.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Two days ago I was much gratified with receipt of your favor of 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst.,—also of your photograph, so very kindly enclosed; I prize it and shall take great care of it. As you expressed a wish for mine, I enclose one—such as it is! (Done at Wellington, in ’65, for General Assembly, in hurry on leaving, &amp; in a gale of wind &amp; rain.) I beg your acceptance of it, it is not so well done as yours.—</p>
         <p>I have read your kind Letter twice; and, while I hasten to reply, I feel I cannot do so as <hi rend="italic">either </hi>of us could wish. I have <hi rend="italic">not time now </hi>for any extra writing: indeed, I have far too much writing to do, (my hand too being disabled), and I could never expect to get through but for something of a “stout heart &amp; resolute will.”—I dig at my Dicty. work daily: <hi rend="italic">to </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">me</hi>, it is much like what your Tunnel <hi rend="italic">was</hi>,—or that of Mt. Denis,—but <hi rend="italic">every stroke </hi>of the<hi rend="italic"> little pick </hi>did something towards its completion.—</p>
         <p>I had hoped to have <hi rend="italic">seen </hi>somewhat of your work on the Moa <hi rend="italic">by this</hi>. I shall keep a look out for Dr. Hochstetter’s Work.—</p>
         <p>You remind me of “Darwin’s queries.” Ah! had my (unfortunate) essay on the Maories been printed, I should have answered them—in part at least—long ago (I wrote to my old friend Dr. Hooker some time ago, requesting him to tell Darwin what I was waiting for.) If that essay should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be printed <hi rend="italic">before</hi> next meeting of Genl. Assembly, I shall give up all hopes of ever seeing it. Your own present enquiry too—about the <hi rend="italic">ancient</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">race</hi> of this country—would also (<hi rend="italic">in part</hi>) have been answered by that essay.—</p>
         <p>——But your own question can not be answered <hi rend="italic">off hand</hi>. You ask,— “Is there any <hi rend="italic">tradition</hi> that <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the Maories <hi rend="italic">came</hi> to N.Z. <hi rend="italic">another people </hi>inhabited the Islands?”—<lb/> 1. What do you mean by “<hi rend="italic">tradition</hi>”?<lb/> 2. What by “<hi rend="italic">another</hi> people”?<lb/>        3.<hi rend="italic">Did </hi>the (present) Maories <hi rend="italic">come</hi> to N.Z.?<lb/>    4.<hi rend="italic">When</hi>?<lb/>­—All this, and<hi rend="italic">much more</hi> which these spirits evoke, I cannot answer now.—I will merely briefly say:—<lb/>     1. There<hi rend="italic">were </hi>Natives in N.Z. even according to their own “tradition” before they came.<lb/>      2. I am<hi rend="italic">no believer </hi>in such statements as, “the present race came here 4, or 500 years ago” (!!)—as related by Taylor, Buller, &amp; others (<hi rend="italic">usque ad nauseam</hi>)—by persons who have gulped down what the Maories of <hi rend="italic">today</hi> have said, as <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> true—Baron Munchausen tales &amp; all!!—and have never considered the subject. Perhaps I should not err in saying, that such consideration was <hi rend="italic">beyond </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">their</hi> powers; or any, indeed, of their class or standing in the Great School of Nature. They did not know how to separate the nucleus of Truth from its many enveloping cysts or layers of Myths:—or (to speak somewhat geologically,) how to get out the innermost fossil septarium from its many zones.——</p>
         <p>Respecting the “Journal of Geologl. Society”—I regret you did not get the loan of it from Mr Mantell. It is vastly too much to have “<hi rend="italic">copied</hi>” <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, being (altogether in the different parts) about 50 pages, and containing besides several <hi rend="italic">interesting </hi>geologl. Diagrams. Moreover there is also “Mantell’s Fossils British Museum” (Bohn’s edition), which is <hi rend="italic">still later</hi>, and which contains additional N.Z. information concerning the Moa: <hi rend="underline italic">this too you should see</hi>.—</p>
         <p>[<hi rend="italic">Entre nous</hi>: I don’t think Prof. Owen and Dr. Mantell agreed very well: some old dispute I believe, so that, possibly, you would not get all of Dr. Mantell even from Owen’s great work.]</p>
         <p>Now I recollect that Dr Mantell’s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> memoir on the Moa, (August 1848,) was <hi rend="italic">republished in N.Z., in the old Wellington “Spectator” Newspaper</hi>—very likely in the autumn of 1849; and as you may find an old file of that Paper in CtChurch, I direct your attention to it. I should think you could find <hi rend="italic">Bohn’s vol.</hi> at some one of your Libraries or Bookshops. <hi rend="underline italic">If not</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">both</hi>, I mean,) I shall be willing to <hi rend="italic">lend you </hi>the vols. or parts (though I am <hi rend="italic">not </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">now</hi> privileged with franking per Mail,)—only—if you send for them—I shall expect to receive from you at the same time copies of your Moa photographs, <hi rend="italic">which I so much wish to see</hi>, having never seen an entire skeleton of any of the species.——</p>
         <p>I can say no more now. While I thank you for mentioning my request to Mr. Stack, I regret now that I had asked you to do so;—but, if I recollect aright, it was only to request him <hi rend="underline italic">to point out some intelligent Native</hi> with whom I might correspond.</p>
         <p>I notice the late Auckland Papers speak of “<hi rend="italic">Tin</hi> being <hi rend="italic">now </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">discovered</hi> in the Thames” (!) I sent to Dunedin Exhibition a specimen of Tin obtained from the Thames in 1838!—which is also mentioned in the Offl. Catalogue.—</p>
         <p>With every good wish,</p>
         <p>I am, My dear Sir,</p>
         <p> Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
