         <p>O sir, O Tiakitai, this indeed is my word to thee; this also being the second of my words to thee, be thou listening hitherward. I am dead, verily dead to the utmost. Thou also hast caused it. For the first time indeed, I am said to be the receiver of the price of women’s blood! but why mention it? when Tiakitai has done it. I did not know, when I was residing at the station, the Cause, why thy daughter died; but on my coming hither to this Sea-coast, I too truly &amp; plainly saw a cause why she ceased to be. Yes, thou didst kill her. Incline thine attention hitherward, hear, thou wert the cause of the death of Kore. Forasmuch as on that very day, in that very self-same hour indeed, in which she ceased to be among us, here thou wert, here, at the whaling-station, stealing women, selling man’s blood, &amp; causing fornication to grow, that thou mightest have money! But what of that? Why speak? Thou hast contended against, yea, thou hast despised GOD, and now thou seest the fruit of thy work. Yes; seest to the very extreme the truth of that word, “The wages of sin is death.” O sir, “Jehovah is known by the judgment which he executeth; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.”—He, himself says this. And this, also, is equally true, “I, Jehovah, thy GOD, am a jealous GOD, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children.” Didst thou indeed forget those words of the Catechism? together with these, “The eyes of Jehovah are in all places beholding the evil and the good; and from him there is nothing hid”? But enough! I have been defiled through thee, but was indeed defiled ignorantly; I was without suspicion; I never once conceived thou wert at hateful works; I believed not thou wouldest presume to bring thy evil upon me: for, what indeed hast thou been done to by me that thou shouldest so act—speak? Oh Sir, thus indeed hast thy evil work been towards me, verily bemiring, my very knees! O Sir, thou hast erred; far, very far off is thy work. If thou wert desirous of causing fornication and adultery to grow, why didst thou not give one of the six<note xml:id="ftn1-56" place="foot" n="56"> WC: He has six wives.</note> whom thou hast, that thou mightest have money? But that compared with this! verily, nothing.—For, besides sin of fornication, here is also the theft, the selling of the daughters of that man as money for thee! this, indeed, is the bad thing; yes, the veriest bad thing. And, then, besides all this, there is yet the very tip top of thy evil—verily this, for this thy word,— “Colenso is agreeable to such payments; that was their course, they two, he and Williams, when living among Ngapuhi”. Lo! it is said, thine indeed are these words, for me, for us two! Enough; be thou listening hither, hear me say, that is false; yes, false to the extreme. For, if it had been so, we should doubtless have been destroyed by <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>; yes, both of us, dead long ago. Now indeed the great sinning man is come; even thou; fearless, shameless, what-less—Alas! for thee, O Tiakitai!</p>
         <p>Go thou, O sir! go thou, to the entrance of the chapel which is nigh thy dwelling; look forth towards the graves; say forth, O Kore, alas! through me thou hast been killed! O my daughter, alas! I was too well-disposed towards the wages of sin! I stole, I sold other girls: I spoke falsely of the ministers of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>; and thou indeed, alas! O Kore! thou indeed art the price!</p>
         <p>Lo! here indeed is thy hateful silver, and thy two pigs; for I will not touch thy things. Enough; it is finished: it will be well if thou considerest the writing,— “Jehovah is known by thy judgment which he executeth; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.</p>
         <p>Now hear me: Return the price of blood to the whites;—bring thence both Emi and Martha; then, pray to <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> to forgive thy evil deeds.—And, dwell mindfully, ceasing thus to sin, lest a worse judgment fall upon thee. Then, when I hear thou hast so done, my heart perhaps may recover from this abiding darkness and grief which remains within and travels with me.</p>
         <p>Once more, go thou not to my house to my place, lest my wife should be afraid because of thee. Let my place be as a forbidden one to thee for these times. This is all my word to thee in this season. It is done.”</p>
         <p>From the Minister of these places of Heretaunga,<lb/>  From Colenso.</p>
