         <p>The Under-Secretary,<lb/>  Col. Secy’s. Office,<lb/>  Wellington.</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst. in which you inform me that the Govt. have found themselves compelled to countermand the instructions given to print my M.L. Such being the determination of the Govt., (which I much regret after my long &amp; patiently waiting,) and which I take to be absolute: I will thank them to return me my Mss. of the said work, (No.1. “A”, clean copy made for press,) the same having been forwarded by me in Feby. 1886, according to their arrangement with me for immediate publication, as I have never recd. a penny for that work, neither for any necessary &amp; stipulated outlay to Maori helpers incurred in my doing it. </p>
         <p>I hope the Govt. will return my Mss. <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> as I am now very far advanced in years.</p>
         <p>I would have replied earlier had I not been absent from Napier.                                              I have &amp;c</p>
