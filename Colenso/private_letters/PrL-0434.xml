         <p rend="end">Napier, Decr. 6/80.</p>
         <p>Mr R.C. Harding,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Say not (even in your heart) “I have forgotten you!” not so: even if I had, <hi rend="italic">fresh arrivals this day </hi>of the same objects from more distant parts would have brought you &amp; your little gifts to remembrance.</p>
         <p>I have now got this curious fungus from 3 (if not 4) sources:—one from S. of Tukituki; one (or two) from you &amp; your brother, and one, today, by mail from beyond Te Wairoa:—and all, unfortunately, broken, &amp;, what is of greater consequence, immature.—</p>
         <p>Better—i.e. far more <hi rend="italic">matured </hi>specimens are needed. Of yours, including those 3 brought up by your brother, there are only 2 worth notice at all: as two of those (3) your brother brought are different,—one being a living larva from <hi rend="italic">under </hi>ground, &amp; one a skin (or exuria) of a perfect insect from above—probably from a fence, or twig, possessing no trace of fungus.—</p>
         <p>The others are all nearly alike: no doubt dug up from just beneath the surface: what is wanted is, (1.) specimens which have just appeared <hi rend="italic">above</hi> ground, as these will, I fancy, have the fungus <hi rend="italic">ripe</hi>, &amp; then we can examine its perithecia &amp; find its spores (seeds):—also (2.) specimens <hi rend="italic">most carefully </hi>taken up, similar to those here, but not broken <hi rend="italic">nor wrapped in cotton</hi>—better <hi rend="italic">very loosely </hi>in a little cone of soft paper.</p>
         <p>More at present I cannot say: should you be pleased to give me a call any evening say 6., or 6.30.—Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly                  W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
