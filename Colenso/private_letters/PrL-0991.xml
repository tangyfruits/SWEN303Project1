         <p>You mention your <hi rend="italic">inferior </hi>and <hi rend="italic">short </hi>schooling: and <hi rend="italic">suppose </hi>that I, in my boy-days, did <hi rend="italic">better </hi>in <hi rend="italic">that</hi>

            <hi rend="underline italic">always</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">so </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">now</hi>—as I often tell my various audiences—working <hi rend="italic">more </hi>like 16 hours a day than “<hi rend="italic">8</hi>”—the foolish popular cry.—Now, however, I find my memory becoming very defective—a concomitant of old age: but my memory is <hi rend="italic">still wonderfully clear—bright—good, of all matters of my early childhood &amp; boy days</hi>! I have before me the old shops &amp; houses, &amp; signs, and their <hi rend="italic">owners</hi> in Penz., their clothes, appearance, every thing perfect; I could, if there, go to <hi rend="italic">old spots</hi>, out of the way, &amp; find <hi rend="italic">certain scarce plants</hi>; of this I wrote a full paper &amp; sent to Dr. Ralphs—but he————.<note xml:id="ftn3-822" place="foot" n="822"> A few stray thoughts on W.

         <p>I must not omit to say, how <hi rend="italic">very pleased</hi> I am in hearing of the success of your sailor-son.—<hi rend="italic">May our Hy.

Another thing pleases me—to find you in your Borough Council: I trust you will keep a good &amp; proper look-out concerning that money I sent for <hi rend="italic">our </hi>Penz. poor,—there are several Cornishmen out here—some from <hi rend="italic">West </hi>Cornwall, Penz. &amp; its neighbourhood, and I always endeavour to let them know I, too, belong to “<hi rend="italic">One &amp; all</hi>,” and we are friendly—as we ought to be.—–</p>
         <p>Here I must stop: I have other letters to write by this Mail: I write a <hi rend="italic">very great number </hi>still, though obliged to give up some correspondents.——</p>
         <p>Goodbye my dear nephew: I hope your good wife is recovered: and with love to you &amp; yours, <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> Believe me</p>
