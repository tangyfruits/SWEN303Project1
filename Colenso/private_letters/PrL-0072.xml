         <p rend="end">Mission Station, March<lb/>23, 1848.</p>
         <p>Mr. W. Morris.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours of the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> I received on the same day, and thank you much for your kind and warm feelings so freely expressed. I can, however, but believe, that you magnify greatly the <hi rend="italic">very few </hi>little offices which it has been in my power to do for you since we have known each other. I scarcely need say to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, that I shall always consider it a pleasure to be able to aid you in any way in my power. We all, at one time or another, need each other’s assistance, during our passage through life.</p>
         <p>I am now about to leave on my long journey. I expect to be back about the middle of June. We may not see each other again. You leave us with regret on my part, and I hope your successor (if one comes) may be so friendly a neighbour.</p>
         <p>And now that you are, as it were, retiring from the turmoil and bustle and anxiety of active life, allow me, as a well-wisher to your interests, to suggest, that you seek to turn your thought towards those things which are solid and sure, and which only can bring a man true peace at the last.—I wish you, from my heart, the <hi rend="underline italic">best</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> blessing</hi>, when I say, May <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, in mercy, cause His Holy Spirit so to shine within, as to lead you to a loving acquaintance with our Saviour Jesus Christ.—Amen.</p>
         <p>I enclose a little Prayer Book for your acceptance in token of remembrance and of kindnesses received from you: also, two little books of Tracts, and a copy of a little publication of my own. Mr. Kier will supply you with whatever you may require, and</p>
         <p>       Believe me ever<lb/>            Very sincerely yours<lb/>                       William Colenso.</p>
