         <p rend="end">Woodville, Sunday aftn.<lb/>May 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. 1894.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding,</p>
         <p>You, I think, will not be wholly surpised in recg. a letter from me written from <hi rend="italic">this place</hi>: I came hither yesty. from Dvk., &amp; purpose retg. thither on Tuesday next, &amp; <hi rend="italic">probably </hi>on to N. on the 26<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Saty. next, which I suppose will quite end my Bush visits until the winter is quite past. I should add I came to Dvk. on 27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Apl., mainly <hi rend="italic">then </hi>to take the Ch. duties there on 29<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. that Robertshawe might visit his far-off &amp; scattered sheep (in the Weber Dist.). On my arrg. there, I found a “wire” of the day before!—soon followed by <hi rend="italic">Lawyers </hi>letters to return immy. to Napier, to see a Wgn. Lawyer <hi rend="italic">there. </hi>I wired NO: then more correspdce. followed by a bulky Affidavit of 10–12 fcp. fol. pp. for me to con.—strike out, add to, &amp;c, &amp;c,—in reply I said I could <hi rend="italic">not </hi>do so from Bush—but would return to N. purposely, also to <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> documents (1845–51,) which <hi rend="italic">now </hi>I refused to part with: so I retd. to N. on 7<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst., was closely shut up 2 whole days, there working hard (for them) &amp; retd. to Dvk. 19<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., after which, <hi rend="italic">more </hi>trouble &amp; worry from them, which only ended on Thursday last (17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst.) <hi rend="italic">if ended</hi>!! Weather fine the whole time (my dear <hi rend="italic">old </hi>N.Z. May!) which still continues. I had <hi rend="italic">believed</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">this day</hi>, also, I was to have the 2 Ch. Services at Dvk. that R. might again go abroad before the winter sets in: to my <hi rend="italic">surprise </hi>he, last wk. informed me that Rev. Arthur Williams (nephew of Archdn. Sam.) was to take the 2 Services there this day, (&amp;, consy., only aftn. Service w. Maoris at Tahoraiti,) &amp; so I concluded to come on here. I could say much more on this <hi rend="italic">head</hi>, but I forbear, because I think <hi rend="italic">this </hi>is an unpalatable subject w. <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—as, whenever I have happened to touch on it in any letter, (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> matters respg. the Williamss,) you have <hi rend="underline italic">always</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> avoided noticing it</hi>—in replying.—</p>
         <p>Your kind note of 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. I found at Dvk. on my return thither (as all letters were to be sent there). I was surprised to find you had <hi rend="italic">so slowly </hi>returned to Wgn as I had supposed you would have gone back on the <hi rend="italic">next day</hi>: but, after all, I think you did right in seeing your <hi rend="italic">old friends</hi> at ’Pukurau, also yr. Uncle at Mt. V.—was pleased to know you had got <hi rend="italic">Home</hi> safely (all the <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, I hope, for your journey) and also to know of your hands being full of work, <hi rend="italic">and</hi>, at yr. having <hi rend="italic">beaten </hi>Ly and B., &amp; others: hope such proper employ may long continue (even if I don’t get <hi rend="italic">any letters</hi>!)—but don’t burn the candle at both ends! At Dvk. I have had 2 pleasant long nights w. Hill—or rather not <hi rend="italic">altogether </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">pleasant</hi> from the fact of his being an outrageous S. Army man!! as well as Prohibitionist! <hi rend="italic">To me</hi>: it is marvellous, how many decent <hi rend="italic">educated </hi>men can hold w. <hi rend="italic">either</hi>: but, <hi rend="underline italic">so it is</hi>. Your mention of Luff, &amp; his <hi rend="italic">query</hi>, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">me</hi>, amuses me—for I think I <hi rend="italic">know his</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>. I have yr. <hi rend="italic">former letter unansd</hi>.,—it contains a Botll. spn. or two,—of which, <hi rend="italic">anon.</hi> I see <hi rend="italic">our </hi>Inst. is coming out tomorrow (a week late!) Dr. Innes “<hi rend="italic">on spectacles</hi>”. Not very alluring: but the Coffee &amp; Cake (if to be had) will make amends: Mrs. Hill is at Xt.Ch., &amp; Miss Large in Engld. I have <hi rend="italic">foolishly </hi>(?) written a lg. p., up here in Bush—which will keep—or, may <hi rend="italic">not </hi>be wanted. I have <hi rend="italic">no </hi>duty here: Eccles offd. this mg., &amp; gave out that he wod. <hi rend="italic">again </hi>this evg.—continue his subject (the “Athanasn. Creed”)—not a very profitable, nor popular one: but, <hi rend="underline italic">so it is</hi>. With kind regards &amp; best wishes (&amp; cold hands!!) <lb/>  Yours sincy.            W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. You came on me <hi rend="italic">so unexpectedly that important matter </hi>I much wished to talk w. <hi rend="italic">you</hi> about, were not even approached!</p>
         <p>21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi> Very cold this mg. severe frost dense fog! weather still fine, &amp; I well—<hi rend="italic">Laus Deo</hi>. Yesty. <hi rend="italic">twice </hi>walked to &amp; from Ch. (here) first time for 2 yrs. but at Dvk. on Friday last walked about 6 miles—and felt it!!!</p>
