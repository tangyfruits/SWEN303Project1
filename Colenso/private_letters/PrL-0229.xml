         <p rend="end">Friday Mg.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I am much obliged to you for Dr. Hector’s Geologl. Report, it has interested me much,—I am sure I scarcely know how to thank you for your very kind remembrance of me.</p>
         <p>I think you are “about right” (as the Americans say) in speaking of this being <hi rend="italic">our driest</hi> season in H. Bay. More than once of late I have thought, whether the burning off all the rank indigenous herbage—and so much of small bush &amp; forest—which once covered our ground and tended to keep the earth damp (and in many places <hi rend="italic">wet </hi>all the summer through) has any thing to do with it—moisture below attracts moisture from above, &amp; it is well known that trees &amp; plants do so.——</p>
         <p>Two things I heard of yesterday—that Sir G. Brown had arrived in Wellington—and that Dr. Selwyn had accepted Lichfield See.</p>
         <p>I hope to send you a few Peaches with this—if the winds have spared any.</p>
         <p>Could you fix some day next week when I could see you in your Office.—I have been long waiting, but without wishing to intrude, or to step in before another whose business may be more important; any day shall suit me.  <lb/>I am</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I don’t think there can be much <hi rend="italic">real </hi>analogy between our floods &amp; droughts—and those of Australia; the difference of latitude, of size of countries, of interior (as far as is known) &amp;c &amp;c—would bar all such; still (as you observe) there is the <hi rend="italic">apparent </hi>one. W.C.</p>
         <p>Did you note in “Independent” of 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. (which I saw at Spit,) how different they had the wind at Wellington on Sunday &amp; Monday last? &amp; while the Bar. there indicated a gale such fell not at Wgn.― W.C.</p>
