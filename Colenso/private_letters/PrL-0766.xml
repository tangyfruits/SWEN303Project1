         <p rend="end">Napier, Friday night<lb/>January 30, 1891.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>Here am I, at the old corner, desirous of writing <hi rend="italic">to you</hi> (as I cannot see, or converse with you!)—although I have little of importance or interest that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write about. To tell you the truth, I <hi rend="italic">feel </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">here</hi> that I want society—some one to see &amp; talk with,—which I have <hi rend="italic">daily</hi> (or oftener) in the Bush; while at <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, “week in, week out,” I scarcely ever see anyone—save my own domestics! And this peculiar feeling is, I fear, growing upon me—for I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> give myself <hi rend="italic">heartily</hi> to Botanical &amp; other sc. studies &amp; matters as I need to do: had I but a <hi rend="italic">road</hi> to my house I would manage better, as then I could go to town, &amp;c., oftener &amp; <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> back! visit Breakwater (<hi rend="italic">still</hi> unknown!!)</p>
         <p>I wrote to you on 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. (and I was then in hopes of mine reaching you <hi rend="italic">before</hi> you would write!—and so begin afresh, as it were, &amp; keep our correspce. <hi rend="italic">more</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">regular</hi>,)—and on 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yours of 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. reached me—so, our letters <hi rend="italic">again</hi> crossed in transit!—I am really sorry not to have obtained <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the pubd. vols. of J. White’s, but the fault is my own—though part of it I am inclined to lay to Didsbury’s door, &amp; for this reason: I suppose you know, the Govt. have always (from McLean’s time) sent me copies of their <hi rend="italic">Maori</hi> Gazette; well, in that, Dy. had—on the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> vol. of J.W’s. being pubd.—a notice in Maori informing the Maoris <hi rend="underline italic">of it</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">,</hi> with<hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">its price</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">,</hi> &amp;c.—&amp; that notice<hi rend="italic">has never been altered—</hi>I have always watched it; thinking some <hi rend="italic">addition</hi>, &amp;c. would be given. I will thank you—there in the <hi rend="italic">city</hi> &amp; knowing Dy. so well—to keep your “weather-eye open”, and when the Parliament is over (progd. <hi rend="italic">or</hi> adjd.)—endeavour to get the vols. for me:—or, let me know who their “Agents” are, &amp; I will soon apply—only hope there are <hi rend="italic">no</hi> “Book-fiends” among them! Is it not <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> that I have not yet heard from McGlashan, Auckland, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> my note on “Early Histy. N.Z.” &amp; chq. for <hi rend="italic">£7.10.0</hi>.</p>
         <p>I have been led to think a little more of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> of late,—from the day of our Annual Mtg. being now close at hand (1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> prox.), and I fear little done towards it! I called on Dr Sp. 2 days ago, &amp; tried to rouse him up a bit, (he wants <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to become <hi rend="italic">President</hi> this year, &amp; says <hi rend="italic">he will </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> stand</hi>! My going to, and sojourning in the Bush is greatly against it and so is the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> of <hi rend="italic">no road</hi> to this house. I also saw Large in town on that same day &amp; had a long talk with him: he ran off to see White to get him to be with L. that evg. I was a little put out w. a curious letter from Hon Secy. White—to hand on Tuesday night, (being mis-addressed to me the week before at Dvk.,)—infg. me of a letter he had recd. from Gore <hi rend="italic">re</hi> my last (Botanl.) paper, saying he (G.) could not understand White, &amp;c.—It appeared that Wh., in forwarding my p., had told G. it was in <hi rend="italic">lieu</hi> of my former Fungi one (!!!) However I soon set it right, plainly &amp; <hi rend="italic">quietly</hi> (taking all the blame—if any) so that Wh. might send on my note to G. by way of explanation.</p>
         <p>Another letter from Canon St. Hill, wishing me to take duty for him (1-8-15) at Clive, while he should be absent at Patea—I have agreed to do so on 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and <hi rend="italic">may</hi>, also, on 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>I hope you have obtained a <hi rend="italic">full</hi> report of Sc. Mtg. at XtCh.—I have recd. 2–3 copies of the “<hi rend="italic">Press</hi>”,<hi rend="italic"> </hi>which contains an enormous deal of reading, (such <hi rend="italic">close</hi> cols., too!)—I find Dr Hocken makes mention of me, among early travellers in N.Z., but (<hi rend="italic">again!</hi>) he makes a woeful mistake <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Marsden: I have not yet read any of their reported papers—only to hand yesty., my head not being very clear for these last 2 days, &amp; eyes affected w. such a lot of <hi rend="italic">small &amp; close</hi> type.—</p>
         <p>In a new book from England I notice in a recent catalogue:—“From the Ptg. Off. to the Court of St. James; the story of the Life of B. Franklin”. By W.M. Thayer, 3/6. And this, of course, set me athinking of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. Again, in a Botanical paper from California (Santa Barbara), in Spanish &amp; Latin, I notice, under the former they use &amp;<hi rend="sup ">a.</hi>. &amp;<hi rend="sup ">a.</hi>.—where we, &amp;c., the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is very small, &amp; it looks <hi rend="italic">natty</hi>. And I may <hi rend="italic">tell you</hi>—they have elected me an Hon. M. of the S. Barbara Sy. of Nat. Histy. There is a strange story in their “Bulletin”, No. 2, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> some (many) cut &amp; carved stones of various kinds, shapes &amp; sizes, found here &amp; there in digging, &amp; in streams, &amp;c—of an <hi rend="italic">ancient</hi> people, but whatever <hi rend="italic">use</hi> could have been made of them is <hi rend="italic">uncertain</hi>: we have the opinions of the <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> (Professors, &amp;c, &amp;c,) on them: some say, weights used in weaving,—sinkers for fishing,—amulets,—<hi rend="italic">charm stones</hi>,—success in hunting, &amp;c, &amp;c. It amuses me, &amp; reminds me of Tregear, &amp; of J. Wh. &amp; possibly (afar off!) of <hi rend="italic">Maskell</hi>!! The Indians, too, all give different accounts—(much after the Moa fashion!) because they <hi rend="italic">don’t</hi> know, and are both <hi rend="italic">fed</hi>, &amp; bothered by the White man: their narrations are laughable. One thing, however, is <hi rend="italic">again</hi> pretty certain—that there, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the present race, were men <hi rend="italic">of a higher civilization</hi>.</p>
         <p>In the Botanl. Paper—is the Latin descrn. of a newly discovered grass at Ecuador, it takes a p. &amp; more, of brevier, <hi rend="italic">close</hi> without a break! <hi rend="italic">55l. to the page,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">width</hi> as marked above! Think of that! ye———who <hi rend="italic">found fault</hi> with my <hi rend="italic">long</hi> descrns!!</p>
         <p>I was amused w. your clipping of a “Pet Whale”, kindly sent, &amp;, as you say, such agrees with Tinirau &amp; Tutunui; also, (or better) with Kataore, the big (huge!!) pet saurian which was <hi rend="italic">fed by its master</hi>, in vol. XI “Trans. N.Z. Inst.”</p>
         <p>This day, a <hi rend="italic">great gala</hi> day here! and the weather fine. Good night.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Sunday night. Feby.1. </hi>I am now going to close: Rain commenced last evg. &amp; has continued ever since, close steady rain, from the N., hence I <hi rend="italic">don’t</hi> move out tonight; I went to Augustine’s w. great diffy. this mg., to assist P. as I had promised—the Bp. retg. this mg. at VIII, in pouring rain! he took the 2 serv. at Cathl. &amp; so liberated us: Hovell is still at Dvk. not much better; living on potatoes &amp; milk! A Miss Cowell was buried this aftn., whom, I think, you knew. Of course, you have heard of the death of Mrs W.W. Carlile!) poor dear lady! I am sorry for him—both so kind to me at Dvk. In Craig’s shop last wk. I saw <hi rend="italic">such </hi>a port. of J. White in an Auckld. P.!! C. as well as myself was astonished! A <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> robust man more like P. of Wales!! am <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> that S. did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gain the coveted prize! only fancy him as <hi rend="italic">Speaker</hi>—in the Major’s <hi rend="italic">absence</hi>!! Ugh! But I have neither time <hi rend="italic">nor heart</hi> for politicg. I am finishing this at <hi rend="italic">same spot</hi> where I commenced it—so <hi rend="italic">well known to you</hi>!—Hope this may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> again X Yours: and that <hi rend="italic">you are well</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">son much better.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>And, w. kindest regards. Yours truly—</p>
         <p>W. Colenso. </p>
