         <p rend="end">Napier, Sept.22/84</p>
         <p>T. F. Cheeseman, Esq<lb/>Auckland.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>A short time back I received a few spns. of a small sp. of <hi rend="italic">Pterostylis</hi> from a Correspondent, and I have lately been examining them. Apparently they seem to be near to <hi rend="italic">Pt</hi>. <hi rend="italic">trullifolia</hi>, Hook.f., but his descriptn. of that plant is not full; and, unfortunately, my recollection of that sp. of <hi rend="italic">Pt</hi>. in particular (which I had also first detected) does not accord with it.</p>
         <p>Suddenly yesterday, I remembered that you had written fully about it some years ago; and so today I have been again reading what you have said, (“Trans. N.Z. Inst.,” Vol. V,)—and now I wish to ask a few questions relative to your dissections (or Buchanan’s lith.) that accompany your paper.</p>
         <p>1. Is the <hi rend="italic">tip</hi> of the lip always <hi rend="italic">as shown</hi>, in the plant full sized; and again in fig. B.?—</p>
         <p>2. Is the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> part of the lip <hi rend="italic">filiform</hi>, as shown in fig. C.?</p>
         <p>3. Is the perianth <hi rend="italic">bulging out</hi> in front, and with an <hi rend="italic">angle</hi> at back, as shown in plant full size?</p>
         <p>4. Is the column—<hi rend="italic">wings</hi>—as shown in fig. C.,—<hi rend="italic">horned</hi> upwards, and <hi rend="italic">rounded entire</hi> downwards?</p>
         <p>5. Is the <hi rend="italic">appendage</hi> to column exactly as shown in fig. C.—i.e. with 4 points? (Hooker says, “villous”).</p>
         <p>6. Is the lowest (or only) leaf near the base, correctly given?</p>
         <p rend="center">________</p>
         <p>As you know this species so very well, I have not hesitated making these enquiries—hoping you may be conveniently able to answer them early.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Pt. trullifa.</hi> was one of my dearest little plants of the north, one of a dozen pleasant associations!—–</p>
         <p>I am, Dr. Sir,<lb/>                  Yours truly,<lb/>                               W. Colenso.</p>
