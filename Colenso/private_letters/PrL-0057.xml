         <p rend="end">Waitangi Heretaunga<lb/>Decr. 31, 1845.</p>
         <p>During the last six months I have been engaged as follows. On the Lord’s day in holding divine Service twice occasionally thrice—i.e. 2 N.Z. and 1 E. Service whenever any Europeans are at hand and a Catechism in schools &amp;c. And on weeks days in attending to the morning adult male school instructing and nominating of Native Candidates for Baptism, Communion and Confirmation, holding Bible classes, visiting sick, Dispensing medicine, settling Disputes, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c and on Thursday evenings lecturing and also attending to many secular duties of the Station. On the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. July I was necessitated to leave the Station in order to carry Mrs. Colenso and child to Turanga; we reached Turanga in safety on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. August and I returned to my Station on the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of the same month. On the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Sept. I left the Station on a visit to the villages in the neighbourhood of the Rotoatara and Waituma Districts and returned on 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of same month.</p>
         <p>On the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. October I left the Station to visit the Natives throughout the District by line of Coast and on to Wellington, and returned in company with the Archdeacon of the District on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Decr.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Colenso prior to her leaving for Turanga attended to the daily Female and Infant School. This last half year has been a time of unusual trial both mental and physical.</p>
         <p>The natives of the neighbourhood have behaved themselves in a very rough manner but I venture to hope that they are becoming more tractable.</p>
