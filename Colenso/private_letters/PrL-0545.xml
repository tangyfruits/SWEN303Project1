         <p rend="end">Napier, Wednesday Sept 5th 1883</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>After we had so suddenly met &amp; parted yesterday, I thought of something I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> wished to say to you; &amp; kept looking about, if I could see you;—but in vain.</p>
         <p>And even now I am not sure of your having returned to Glenross, still, as tomorrow is the mail day for that place, thinking you will be sure to be there before long, I now write.</p>
         <p>I wished to remind you of those little <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ</hi>, (the <hi rend="italic">Symphogyna</hi>) you sent me specimens of last year, but those were not very good, though of use, to aid me with those of Readers from Blenheim.</p>
         <p>I presume they are <hi rend="italic">now</hi> in fruit; so, if you can, just put me up a few, earth mosses &amp; all as they grow; their fruit stalks are terribly tender while fresh. I have lately had a few good ones from Hamilton—collected by him in Waikato last year, and the same species.</p>
         <p>And dinna forget the divott plants—which will soon flower—Oct or Nov.—with you (shearing time).</p>
         <p>             With kind regards</p>
         <p>                             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. A few of the flowering stalks of your Divott plants (<hi rend="italic">Sarcochilus</hi>) cut off <hi rend="italic">close</hi> to plant, &amp; put carefully into a small bottle with Whiskey;—other few dry in usual way. W.C.</p>
