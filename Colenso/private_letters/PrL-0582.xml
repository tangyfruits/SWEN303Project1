         <p>Mr R.C. Harding,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your note of 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst., enclosing a newspaper clipping, is just to hand, (accidentally I may say,) and as I am leaving here tomorrow for further S., I write at once in reply.—</p>
         <p>I felt sorry in reading your note:—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should have been so taken with a mere Newspaper par. of what occurred some 50 years ago and apparently founded on such a poor basis.<note xml:id="ftn3-271" place="foot" n="271"> The newspaper article refers to the arrival of the first printing press in NZ, and quotes Wade and Colenso.</note> There are several errors in it, more than I care to correct from memory in a note—written too, at a distance from my residence. I was greatly <hi rend="italic">surprised </hi>when I first saw the said par. (with <hi rend="italic">editorial</hi> errors!) in a Wellington paper,—whence, too, I had a copy quickly sent me by a gentleman there, enquiring, &amp;c. I trust you will not insert it in your proposed Almanac for 1885.———</p>
         <p>I have been here some time, and this day is the 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. of continuous rain and of my close imprisonment! It is very cold today as well as very wet, so that I am obliged to keep a big fire burning. If you, there, have such weather, it will sadly mar your holidays! and a good thing, too, if such should serve to lessen them.—–</p>
         <p>I hope you are quite well: ditto your good Father, and the rest of your family.</p>
         <p>And with kind regards</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
