         <p rend="end">Napier May 11/78</p>
         <p>Mr. John McCulloch,<lb/>Collector of Rates,<lb/>  Foxton:—Sir, A short printed notice (without date) addressed to Mr A. Luff, Napier, has been received here in my absence, requesting payment of Rates on property for the year ending 31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. March last, amounting to 7/- (seven shillings).</p>
         <p>As a friend of Mr Luff (who is in England,) I have taken out this letter, and now send you enclosed a P.O.O. for the said amount of 7/-,—for which please send me a Receipt.</p>
         <p>I think it would have been better (more regular &amp; reasonable) if you had in your notice stated what the said property is,—if Land, its area, where situate, &amp;c., &amp;c. Indeed I am wholly in the dark about it, as your brief formal notice gives no information: but, I suppose it is “all right.”                                                                I am, &amp;c</p>
         <p>                                                     (signed)        Wm. Colenso.</p>
