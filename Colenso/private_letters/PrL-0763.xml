         <p rend="end">Napier, Jany. 13.<lb/>1891</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Having, at last! got over some of my labours—particularly the recasting &amp; copying for press (if ever permitted to attain <hi rend="italic">that</hi> distinction!) of my paper on Botany—a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> (only 1 doz.!) plants shown at our Meetings in 1890—&amp; this <hi rend="italic">I only last night finished</hi>, &amp; purpose taking it to Secy. White tomorrow.—Well, now I turn to you. Not but that I have been having you <hi rend="italic">daily</hi> (yea hourly, I may truly say) in my mind, as I think you will partly allow, when you go through all I now send you—a rare &amp; quaint &amp; surprising lot!—which I fancy <hi rend="italic">to you</hi> will be more than commonly interesting.</p>
         <p>In a <hi rend="italic">registered</hi> packet, with this, I send 16 letters from Woon &amp; other (&amp; <hi rend="italic">the Chief</hi>) old W.M. Missioneries—I have <hi rend="italic">plenty more, </hi>similar, but these may well suffice. Those letters will speak for themselves, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will note the great difference in <hi rend="italic">both</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">style, &amp;c</hi>. of the letters of W. Woon &amp; J. Hobbs.—When you have quite done with them, return to me in <hi rend="italic">regd. packet.</hi>—</p>
         <p>I also put up a <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> sheet, <hi rend="italic">extracts</hi>, &amp;c—<hi rend="italic">one item</hi> therein in particular will astonish you (&amp; Sherrin, too!!!) <hi rend="italic">if true</hi>, but, <hi rend="underline italic">to me</hi> it is wholly a mystery!—</p>
         <p>Strange to say—I have only <hi rend="underline italic">recently</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> looked into</hi> J.White’s 1 &amp; 2 vols., and am astonished at <hi rend="italic">his “</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">Dicty</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">”.</hi>—have you seen it? J.W. says</p>
         <p>“<hi rend="italic">A</hi>—was the name given to the author of the Universe, &amp; signifies—“Am the unlimited in power,” “The conception,” “Am the leader”, and “The beyond all.” Vol I. p.4.</p>
         <p>And so on, &amp; so on!!!—</p>
         <p>And in the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Vol., which he sent me, but which I only last week took out of its wrapper, (as I had previously got a copy from Wgn.) I find, written by him:—</p>
         <p>             “W. Colenso, Esq. F.L.S</p>
         <p>                     He mihi naku ki tana tino mohio kinga mea katoa a nga mahi a nga maori.”</p>
         <p>                             (signed) “John White”</p>
         <p>(I think you will <hi rend="italic">easily</hi> translate this.)</p>
         <p rend="center">———</p>
         <p>I notice your remark in “Typo”, (last no., to <hi rend="italic">hand since</hi> my last,) re Bates &amp; Wills, Opotiki. Have you seen a copy of Gisborne “Standard” of Decr. 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>—contg. a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> &amp; circumstantial article (or communication) re Mr Wills? If <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, &amp; you would like to see it, I will send you my copy,—a friend sent it to me from Gisborne, while I was at Dvk.—I know <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of the man.</p>
         <p>(<hi rend="italic">XI. a.m</hi>.) I was concluding preceding p., when my man retd. from T. w. <hi rend="italic">your </hi>letter of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I have read it, but am <hi rend="italic">not greatly</hi> surprised at it—I mean the Archdn’s. reply to you:—<hi rend="italic">partly</hi> from what I have gleaned <hi rend="italic">since</hi> my last to you (now forwarded) &amp; partly from the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> of the Archdn. <hi rend="italic">knowing nothing</hi> about it save from the merest hearsay—he, in 1830, being a baby! &amp; partly (and mainly) from my having lived there in Bay of Islands 10 years, &amp; <hi rend="italic">never once</hi> having heard the most distant sound of such a thing! What became of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>? &amp; of its <hi rend="italic">numerous belongings</hi>!!——The Moa—<hi rend="italic">left its bones</hi>.—</p>
         <p>One thing, however, is (to me) <hi rend="underline italic">very certain</hi>, that the C.M.<hi rend="underline">Sy</hi>.—had nothing to do with that press; it must (if real) had been both a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">private</hi> affair.</p>
         <p>Fielder (as Ch. Registrar) took up the matter—omission of my name, &amp;c, in Almc.—<hi rend="italic">in </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">their</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">professed correct</hi> List of Licensed Clergy, and they got off in this way—that they had copied, from <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Ms. (sent in) contg. names of those who were entitled to vote at meetings of Synod—&amp; F. believed them! but I showed, they had got <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the name of Townshend who died last year! &amp; which, of course, was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in F’s. List!! But the truth is—in what Peter told me <hi rend="italic">re</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Hoben</hi>—who, some time ago, wrote a letter in one of our locals <hi rend="italic">against me</hi>—though I never knew the man.—In their <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi>-printed Almc. they have even put <hi rend="italic">advts</hi> on the pages! I mentd. to P. <hi rend="italic">re</hi> advts—stuck everywhere. “O! The advts. are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to us”!!</p>
         <p>I do not remember my telling you in my last (on 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>)—that Rev. M. Parkinson had been here on that day to see me, &amp; I <hi rend="italic">must </hi>assist (in the Dean’s absence) &amp; take <hi rend="italic">Mg. S.</hi> in Cathedrl. on 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., &amp; Evg. S. in his Church! or <hi rend="italic">close</hi>, &amp;c. so I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to assent, fearing much, from Rheum. &amp; to have to go up &amp; down this steep hill 4 times in the 1 day! On Friday nt. a note from P.—“Archd. W. was to be in town <hi rend="italic">again</hi>”, (I suppose <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Te Aute) “&amp; had <hi rend="italic">offered</hi> to assist.”—so I got off from <hi rend="italic">the Evg. S.</hi> (only had to read the 2 lessons)—but found it a <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> task (physically) in the <hi rend="italic">long</hi> Mg. S. at Cathedral—especially so much <hi rend="italic">standing</hi> (unassisted by table or form, or chair, to lean agt.) &amp; so much of <hi rend="underline italic">stairs</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">steps</hi> work!—having <hi rend="italic">to go up (without </hi>my faithful stick!) <hi rend="italic">to vestry chamber</hi>, to say a prayer for Choir, at beg. &amp; at close!</p>
         <p>I climbed this hill on Sunday nt. in darkness, &amp; weakness (knees), &amp; pain! and now I find, instead of my retg. to Bush on Friday (16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>)—as per <hi rend="italic">return</hi> ticket—I shall have to remain—to help, &amp;c.—Well, I <hi rend="italic">am willing to do all that I can</hi>.</p>
         <p>Your last is shorter than usual and I think you have omitted 1, or 2, questions I put—in it; or in a former one.—</p>
         <p>Could you Enq. for me, of Didsbury, if he has <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> (i.e. vols. III onwards) of J. White’s work—owing to fire: and, if so, let him send me <hi rend="italic">those</hi> vols, &amp; I will remit amount in P. Notes.—</p>
         <p>And also—if in <hi rend="italic">your track</hi>—to &amp; from Office—of Wrigglesworth &amp; Binns,—if they still have my photo Carte—taken in ’65? &amp; if so, to send me 2 doz. Copies. I had some from them a <hi rend="italic">few years ago</hi>: 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> time I think.</p>
         <p>I enclose (in packet) a clipping <hi rend="italic">re</hi> “Fuegian Dicty”. (something for Tregear!) which <hi rend="italic">may surprise </hi>even you<hi rend="italic">—if </hi>new<hi rend="italic">.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I rejoice with you (and Mrs Harding) in knowing that your dear little son “<hi rend="italic">is better</hi>”: good. <hi rend="italic">Live in Hope</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">look up</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Here I am <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>—as to visitors, &amp; I don’t care to go down to town: but I have <hi rend="italic">lots</hi> to do, and daily get on (with my <hi rend="italic">pie</hi>!) not, withstanding Rheum. which comes &amp; goes! It was <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> last Thursday–Saty., &amp; made me to fear for Sunday—but it was very much less then, &amp; <hi rend="italic">not at all</hi> while in Ch. I have a letter <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Electropathic belt on its way. Hope <hi rend="italic">your</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> may receive a <hi rend="italic">fitting</hi> reception at XCh.</p>
         <p>             And now once more ADieu! With kindest regards,</p>
         <p>                             Yours affy.,</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>(This detained till tomorrow as cannot register packet by night)</p>
         <p>P.S. night. I had not sealed my letter, when I saw in D.T. the sudden death of <hi rend="italic">John White</hi>! I suppose <hi rend="italic">our</hi> J.W., of whom I was writing to you this mg.</p>
