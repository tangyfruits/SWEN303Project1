         <p rend="end">Napier August 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> 1880</p>
         <p>Mr John Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I now, after a long delay, proceed to answer your letter of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst. No doubt you have been expecting to hear from me before this, &amp; I should have written had I not been so busily engaged in writing. I can truly say, that I have daily had you in my mind and if I had thought a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> note would have been a sufficient reply to your last, I could have scrawled you one; but it is often in writing (I know it has been so with me) much as it is when one wishes to give a dear friend, or a near dear relation, a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> dinner—it takes so much longer to get prepared and cooked, than a common every day one; and so, sometimes, is postponed. And there was one portion of your letter, that about Phrenology, which as you had asked me the question, I wished particularly to reply to.</p>
         <p>Your letter arrived as I was in the midst of writing for Outgoing English Mail; &amp; then, that over, I had such a lot of letters to answer; to all parts of NZ., and in both Islands, too, that I was obliged to work hard in replying,—some I answered yesterday, some today, &amp; some are yet to be taken in hand; for like horses waiting at your smithy (in busy times) they must just take their turn. And then, I may tell you,—with many of those letters referred to came specimens, of ferns, Birds, Fossil teeth, &amp; shells,—Quartz (gold ore), &amp;c, &amp;c, all requiring some time in examination; sometimes I have to refer to 6–8 or 10, Books, for a single small fern, to be <hi rend="italic">correct</hi>. Last week I received some small fossil Teeth, of animals of the <hi rend="italic">olden</hi> time; from a new correspondent inland; to me they were very interesting, &amp; I certainly spent more than 2 days in examining them &amp; writing my reply; for not content with my own books, I went <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> purposely to town to hunt up &amp; consult others, mostly however in our own Philosophical Institute Library. I also received some delightful <hi rend="italic">little</hi> Ferns from Christchurch, about 25 specimens, all in one 2d letter; &amp; among them some <hi rend="italic">new ones</hi>. I wrote back about them yesterday, but I have still to dissect &amp; examine them. I suppose these were sent to me through their seeing in the new Vol of Transactions of N.Z. Institute (XII just printed) 3 new Ferns of my discovery described.―Now I venture to give <hi rend="italic">you </hi>all this—which I would scarcely do to any one else—hereabouts.</p>
         <p>I was <hi rend="italic">much pleased</hi> with your letter!. The main thing that pleased me in it, is your candour, openness, &amp; confidence in me, and then your enquiry. I will not say to you—continue to write to me in that way, because I believe that you will do so; &amp; I will endeavour to reciprocate your candour, &amp; reply to the best of my ability.</p>
         <p>I can quite understand, aye more, I <hi rend="italic">can sympathize</hi> with you, in your “ups &amp; downs” of thinking,―or being in good or bad spirits dependent on <hi rend="italic">externals</hi>. And, no doubt, you away there at Ongaonga—sometimes in loneliness (of work, at least,) &amp; without much of grand natural scenery near you (the ever-moving sea, for instance), &amp; without the daily little bustle of Taradale,—why, you must feel it.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">[Page missing]</hi>
            <note xml:id="ftn3-55" place="foot" n="55"> The page of this letter (in which Colenso presumably deals with phrenology) is missing.</note>
         </p>
         <p>spots) says,—while writing his letter (a long one) he had to drop pen &amp; go out into the garden and with a very long handled rake pull down the snow from the evergreens, lest its weight should smash the branches,―which it had done in Jany, it had then been snowing all the morning.</p>
         <p>And now to No 2—I shall send you with <hi rend="italic">great pleasure</hi> copies of my three letters, my readers of them would scarcely believe that I wrote them while suffering no little pain from Rheumatism—in defence of the Jews (the <hi rend="italic">weaker</hi> side);<note xml:id="ftn3-56" place="foot" n="56">
               <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>  28, 30 and 31 March 1881.</note>—I got a few extra papers for my friends; as my letters were semi-historical, and <hi rend="italic">something more</hi>, which (no doubt) <hi rend="italic">you </hi>may detect. I can only write, as I think &amp; believe, &amp; feel, &amp; speak,―for the truth. I would that our <hi rend="italic">new</hi> paper (Waipawa M.) did contain a <hi rend="italic">little more</hi> of news—or of <hi rend="italic">good </hi>useful reading for its inland subscribers—being 3d too (or three times the cost of the “D.T.”) it should contain more—or, I fancy, great dissatisfaction.</p>
         <p>I have not forgotten the last years volume of Transactions N.Z.I. for you; some time ago I wrote to headquarters at Wgn for some copies—but they have not yet arrived. I am <hi rend="italic">again</hi> in for the heavy work of our branch this year; our first meeting is on the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> May, &amp; I <hi rend="italic">must be ready</hi>. From a letter to hand from Dr Hector I find, that <hi rend="italic">all </hi>my papers read here last session and recd. by him in time (exc. for <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, the Zoological one, was <hi rend="italic">too late</hi>) have been printed in this new Vol. I hope to leave for Bush &amp;c. on Wednesday next, spending a few days at Kaikoura (Sandys), and at Gows. Hope this may find you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> quite well; and that rascal Keating is receiving the rent!!! I have offered to leave it to arbitration; <hi rend="italic">we shall see.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Now, I think, I have pretty well replied to your letter—adding a little by way of interest―for delaying to pay my epistolary debt; at all events you can have no fault to find with the quantity―though you may with the quality.</p>
         <p>Perhaps I should add, that, while I am an utter disbeliever in Phrenology,―I do believe a little in Physiognomy; in fact the older I grow the more I believe in it―but only in a plain natural kind of way. I think it is pretty much developed in the faces of <hi rend="italic">four footed</hi> animals too; possibly more so than in the faces of bipeds, just because <hi rend="italic">they</hi> take <hi rend="italic">no</hi> pains—in look, gesture, voice, or dress to conceal what nature reveals in the face. For my own part, I should not be as much inclined to purchase a horse or a cow or a dog by its look, its face, as I should by any other qualification. I dare say that <hi rend="italic">you </hi>must often have noticed the wonderfully varied expressions in the faces of horses.</p>
         <p>Do you know that often when I look out from this hill toward Taradale with my glass, I lift it higher and away into your more distant settlement, which, however, is hidden behind the hills—then I think on you. And so it is with me toward others at a distance whom I cannot see.</p>
         <p>Last week (especially Friday &amp; Saturday) it was quite <hi rend="italic">hot </hi>here; while today it is cold, windy, raining, &amp;c. Hope you are warmly &amp; well employed in your Smithy <hi rend="italic">today</hi>.—</p>
         <p>And with kind regards, &amp; very best Wishes, believe me to  be</p>
         <p>Yours very truly<lb/>  Wm Colenso.</p>
