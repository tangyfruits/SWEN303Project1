         <p rend="end">NAPIER, TUESDAY 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>
            <lb/>July 1885; VIII pm</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>My man is jut up from P.O. bringing me your note of the 18th, and as I feel <hi rend="italic">disinclined</hi> to do any more work tonight, and as your weekly mail leaves us tomorrow, I essay to write you a few lines. It seems a very long time since I last heard from you; and, since my last to you, mine has been a poor kind of life—a month or five weeks almost wasted.</p>
         <p>I left town on 19th of June purposing to go to Woodville (in quest of some money <hi rend="italic">long</hi> owing to me)—I halted at Norsewood—weather fine (night very cold)—thermr. 33° in my bedroom. Just as I was starting afresh for Woodville, I was struck with Lumbago—and done for; thus 8–10 days passed then rain came on, ear ache &amp;c,—on July 8th I came back to ’Pukurau (abandoning Woodville); there I caught a <hi rend="italic">dreadful</hi> cold; came to Napier on the 10th, and have not been out since. Last week it was doubtful if I would recover. I am now got round ag­ain—in appearance, but my chest &amp;c is still so so; cough very bad a nights.—</p>
         <p>Of course I did very little in the Bush—only paid about three visits in three weeks, to the forests, &amp; then—in <hi rend="italic">their recesses</hi>—cold &amp; wet but Crypts coming out into flower, &amp;c, elegant, charming; left them with a sigh.! I gained as usual, some new species. But alas, I shall have to set aside Botany!! This ugly job of Mao Lexican, which I have been <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to assent to, will take all my time, and more too. I am preparing for it—but I would give £100 to be off it. It <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been done 15 years ago when the Gov of the day stopped it—but <hi rend="italic">now</hi>!.</p>
         <p>Glad you got Vol XVII all right &amp; that you like it. I have my copy here, which I have just barely looked into. Fortunately I had drawn up descriptions of some new plants in the summer &amp; autumn while inland, &amp;c, &amp; so, there will be a Botanical Paper for XVIII—if <hi rend="italic">allowed</hi>. Of course you saw in the “Herald” <hi rend="italic">no meeting</hi> H.B.P.I. this month; <hi rend="italic">ostensibly</hi> put down to want of a room—but perhaps, owing to want of papers &amp;c.—I was absent tho back in time to attend if I had been well enough. <hi rend="italic">I have seen no one here</hi>.</p>
         <p>Your (3 Bulbs) much smashed up under stamping, are to hand, but I fancy they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of the Orchid family; rather of a small wiry stem <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> which bears pink flowers &amp; grows among fern &amp; grass &amp;c. The winter is (as you say) mild. Hope you are all well &amp; I may keep so</p>
         <p>and w. kind regards, I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
