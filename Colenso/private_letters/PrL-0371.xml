         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand,<lb/>June 12/78.</p>
         <p>A. Luff Esq.,</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>My last to you was (finally) dated May 25th., not 3 weeks ago,—and our Mail will not leave before 22nd. but I am thinking of taking a <hi rend="italic">run</hi> inland to Waipukurau in a couple of days, &amp; as I may be a full week absent, I had better write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> before I leave, as I shall Register, owing to the enclosure. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> may well start, &amp; ask, “Why go inland in the winter season, &amp; not holding office”! Because for the last 6 weeks I have been closely engaged every day writing, and I <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> the <hi rend="italic">need</hi> of a change: &amp; I dislike going into town, as there is <hi rend="italic">no place now</hi> where I can look in &amp; <hi rend="italic">sit down</hi> &amp; so rest: Govt. Buildings I have forsaken. Except this <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi>—my health is pretty good; though I don’t sleep very well.—</p>
         <p>Enclosed is a duplicate copy of the little Order I troubled you with in my last, also the <hi rend="italic">2nd.</hi> of the Draft then sent. I will merely remark (should <hi rend="italic">that</hi> letter <hi rend="italic">not</hi> reach your hands,)—that, as I said in my last, you are at perfect liberty to hand it over to “Dixon &amp; Co.”, to be by them executed, or to <hi rend="italic">any one</hi> else whom <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may approve of. I sincerely hope that I shall not have offended you in troubling you with it. I am also sending a £<hi rend="italic">50</hi>. dft. to Wesley (a <hi rend="italic">second</hi>),—it would be well if you would look in on him, &amp; perhaps advise <hi rend="italic">re</hi> shipment, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>Last Saturday (8th.) I received your kind &amp; welcome letter of April 24th.—I feel greatly indebted to you for your letters—I don’t know what I should do without them (used as I am to losses &amp; crosses!) I feel pretty strongly that I am getting—or <hi rend="italic">got</hi>—into a habit of looking for them by every mail, as much as a confirmed smoker for his pipe, or an old maid her cup of tea! I am not a little pleased at the continued good progress of your eldest son, &amp; think he has done well in choosing <hi rend="italic">that</hi> profession, wish him from my heart all that he can wish for himself &amp; hope he may <hi rend="italic">get on.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I received (as usual) a good lot of Papers from you,—I have not opened any yet save the 2 “Pictorial Worlds” as I wished to see Selwyn’s likeness,—how much he was altered!! <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">same man,</hi> but now, too, <hi rend="italic">like others</hi>, shewing that <hi rend="italic">he had known</hi> pain &amp; grief.—I have looked at it several times and have <hi rend="italic">talked</hi> to it. – – – – –</p>
         <p>I don’t know if you will recollect two pictures in that same P.W., both in one page: one a lot of <hi rend="italic">men</hi> (!) “Inter-University” (in Ireland, I think,)—the other some blacks engaged in wheeling &amp; stowing away Bales of Cotton on a wharf,—and I asked myself again &amp; again: which <hi rend="italic">are the men</hi> &amp; which the animals—or <hi rend="italic">fools</hi>!—</p>
         <p>I feel sick—at so much fuss being made (&amp; <hi rend="italic">precious time lost</hi> &amp; money squandered—while 1000ds. &amp; 10’s of 1000’s are in dreadful want) over such unprofitable things as this “Australian” Cricket playing &amp; the University Boat Racing!!—<hi rend="italic">I feel sick at it.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>We have <hi rend="italic">news here</hi>. Rd. Craig (Newton’s Bror.-in-law) was killed on Monday evening in riding to Town from <hi rend="italic">Bradley’s</hi> hotel; he never spoke. Inqt. held this mg. (You will see it in Papers). Carlile is <hi rend="italic">no longer</hi> Edr. of Herald! a <hi rend="italic">great split</hi> among them, &amp; so they have separated. (No doubt the firm were losers through Carlile’s <hi rend="italic">unseemly</hi> ratting). C. has now advts. in both papers concerning <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">new </hi>one (the <hi rend="underline italic">Courier</hi>) which is to be. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> had a very good meeting on Monday night at the C. Chamber; unfortunately through Sturm <hi rend="italic">not</hi> turning up (which he had <hi rend="italic">promised</hi>) your friend was the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> performer!! For nearly 3 hours was I on my legs (including going &amp; returng.). However it was well: Mr. &amp; Mrs. Locke, Mrs. May w. 3 of her biggest Boarders, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Newton (little thinking what <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> news was at hand <hi rend="italic">for them</hi>!) Mr. Kinross &amp; Miss Goudy, F. Nelson (<hi rend="italic">lately</hi> returned from England), Meinertzhagen, Holder, Judge Logan, Dr. de Lisle, &amp;c, &amp;c,—&amp; Bp. of Waiapu in Chair—but see Paper (<hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>). It is all very well to give one a “vote of thanks” &amp; all that kind of thing,—but, <hi rend="italic">as it is now</hi> &amp; has been—<hi rend="italic">all</hi> falling on <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, why it is work enough to keep me <hi rend="italic">closely employed</hi>; the accounts, the minutes, the meetings, the letters,—the papers to write, the Books &amp; specimens to pack up &amp; take down, &amp; pack up and bring back! and yet, my dear friend, there is nothing more sure than this,—if <hi rend="italic">I slack</hi>, down it falls! Our Annual Report is now in printer’s hands, and a copy I will send you by Mail. Miss Herbert, is now proposed as a candidate for our Institute!! And then the branch work (so to speak) that it brings—last night I was engaged till xi (5 hours) in writing 2 long scientific letters—one to Fereday (Xt.Ch.) a good Entomologist, &amp; a good correspondent,—&amp; one to Petrie, (Dunedin,) on Botany &amp; Geography: he has lately got out a new “Geogy. of N.Z.”—in which I assisted him; it is printed at Melbourne. Petrie is Inspr. Schools, Otago. I like the work but, having <hi rend="italic">no visitors</hi>, I stick to it <hi rend="italic">too closely</hi>—all day &amp; all night,—so that hand, &amp; arm, &amp; chest, ache.</p>
         <p>I have not seen your friend Grubb for some time to speak with; I often <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him talking among a little knot outside, but I do not (&amp; shall not) trouble him, Yet I shall have to see him on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> acct. before that I go inland, for yesterday my man brought me 2 of those Govt. Insce. envelopes, addd. to you, but in pencil on outside (<hi rend="italic">written here</hi>), c/- W.C.—so I shall go &amp; see G. about them, and if there is any money to pay <hi rend="italic">for you</hi> I shall <hi rend="italic">gladly</hi> do it.—</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Inspr. has not yet come. I believe he is to be here shortly.—<hi rend="italic">Now</hi> they have printed placards stuck up at Govt. Bldgs., “To Inspr. Schools’ Office”; &amp; the off. is the old Provl. Cl. Library put to rights. He has had an advt. in paper for a House of 7–8 rooms &amp; “a garden of <hi rend="italic">½ an acre</hi>”.</p>
         <p>There have been several deaths since my last.—Peddie’s Brother at Taradale, <hi rend="italic">Groom</hi>, 3 days go: old Mrs. Massey at Clive; old Mrs. Blair at West Clive; several children, in various places. There is great cry for doing away w. the Toll-Gates, and I think they will succeed. (You may remember my opposn., &amp; <hi rend="italic">threat</hi> too, in P. Council). Hill &amp; Whitmore are <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> for J. Rhodes’ old scheme—a bridge across the Tukituki.—J. Richards, (deaf) milkman is selling off, going to leave. I was to have gone today to Taradale, to see how <hi rend="italic">R. &amp; D.</hi> are getting on, but the heavy rain set in <hi rend="italic">last night</hi>, &amp; it has been raining all day. Supreme Ct. opened this mg., but for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> I must refer you to the Papers.</p>
         <p>Weather (until last night late) has been fine &amp; bracing. Arikiti’s demurrer against H.R.R.—his enormous Bill!—has been allowed in Appeal Court before nearly all the Judges! more work for the Lawyers &amp; <hi rend="italic">waste of money.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Rees</hi> has <hi rend="italic">bought</hi> Sutton’s old shop and premises from Massey; and the Natives are joyful over it,—saying, It ought to be theirs, as <hi rend="italic">in that</hi> building &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c. (<hi rend="italic">You must fill in.</hi>) I asked Massey, <hi rend="italic">privately</hi>, If he <hi rend="italic">had </hi>his money; he winked, &amp; said “<hi rend="italic">All right.</hi>”—There is still a feeling abroad, that I have been ill-used by E. Board:—Tiffen told me the other day, that he &amp; others thought I had “been used <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> bad”. Chambers very much vexed &amp; <hi rend="italic">cast down</hi> about it. Neal told me (before others) “I ought to have had a retiring allowance”. Reardon told me that “Lee had broken his word <hi rend="italic">to them</hi>” (R.C’s.) and that “he was a perfect <hi rend="italic">Satan</hi>”—I think I have some claim for compensation.—Bide a wee.</p>
         <p>Fannin still works, &amp; puffs &amp; blows. Cohen is building 4 cottages on the <hi rend="italic">leased</hi> T. Reserve, <hi rend="italic">next to mine</hi>, <hi rend="italic">this side</hi> of M. Club.</p>
         <p>And so I have given you <hi rend="italic">this</hi> night. Of course, if anything turns up worthy another letter I can write you from inland.</p>
         <p>With very kind regards &amp; best wishes.</p>
         <p>Bel. me, my dear friend, yours truly, W. Colenso.</p>
         <p rend="end">
            <hi rend="italic">No.2.                                                                                                 </hi>Thursday night <lb/>  June 13th.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir—I little thought—last night, when I closed a tolerably long letter to you, that I should be so soon writing to you again! But so it is.</p>
         <p>This mg. I went to town—1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. to see Grubb (if disengaged) <hi rend="italic">re</hi> your two Govt. envelopes; as soon as I produced them he tore them up into bits (without opening) saying , “He knew all about it, &amp; that it was allright.” I said, “If any money was required I would advance it.” G. said “No: that you had sent out a Draft from Engd. to him to meet it.”—He was chatty &amp; polite,—not (apparently) so busy as I have found him: and I think he said, He had commenced writing to you last night. So that little matter is settled.</p>
         <p>Leaving P.O. I met Newton, who told me how much <hi rend="italic">all</hi> had been upset abut R. Craig; that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had first heard of it on their way home from Institute Meeting, and that he feared the shock would carry Mrs. Craig! poor dear old lady, I must try &amp; go to see her tomorrow.—</p>
         <p>The day was delightfully fine <hi rend="italic">over-head</hi>, plenty of mud &amp; water <hi rend="italic">below</hi>—so I went to Taradale by Rymer, &amp; returned by him. Seems to be plenty of business up there—but little <hi rend="underline italic">money</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">.</hi> R. &amp; Drummond have made out all their accounts: <hi rend="underline italic">good</hi> debts, £420. (Bills mostly delivered) only £25. came in, all have <hi rend="italic">promised</hi>, <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the fixed time, &amp; next week ends it! £300. is all that is absolutely required. Taradale folks were flocking to the “Shamrock,” to sign petition to do away with Toll-gates. I encouraged them to the utmost.—</p>
         <p>Bradley (<hi rend="italic">new publican</hi>) I heard was in <hi rend="italic">Queer</hi> Street! &amp; now, in this evening’s Paper, B. is Gazetted Bankrupt!! so is little Powell, the tailor,—after building a fine 2-story house for his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> residence on hill, &amp; a Brick Shop for himself in town!! I shall not be surprised to hear, that his house has been <hi rend="italic">settled on his wife.</hi>—I notice in this evening’s paper that Buchanan’s eldest daughter was married last week at Wellington: and from the same Paper, the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Inspector is <hi rend="italic">come</hi>! w. wife &amp; family &amp; servant.</p>
         <p>Returning, I saw Capt. Kennedy, <hi rend="italic">looking as</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">well as ever</hi>: we had a hearty shake hands: he commands the “<hi rend="italic">Hawea</hi>” now, a big steamer.—</p>
         <p>I got today from a friend a copy of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> article which Carlile wrote for “<hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>”, but which was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> allowed by partners to be inserted.—I shall send it, <hi rend="italic">enclosed in the Paper with a</hi>
            <hi rend="underline"> </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">P.O. wrapper.</hi> I also send you an Auckland “Weekly News,” containing a big map of our Public Works.—</p>
         <p>Brandon is in his new &amp; enlarged house at Meeanee; but the surroundings—dead dry rusty <hi rend="italic">Raupo</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">toetoe</hi> (cutting grasses), and Poplars &amp; willows <hi rend="italic">without</hi> leaves—are wretched! I would not live there,—not for ₤200. a yr. <hi rend="italic">to do so.</hi> The roads all about there, too, (after such heavy rain) are dreadful.—</p>
         <p>I hear that Miss Covney (teacher of Meeanee School) is to be married to young Powdrell. 4 beautiful Cock pheasants came down on ’bus,—2 for Weber, 2 for Tabuteau: all from Beamish.</p>
         <p>I hear that H.R.R. is keeping <hi rend="italic">several </hi>lawyers <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi> at it. I pity him: &amp; I pity <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">others.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Do you recall those lines of Pope, (speaking of “the Happy Man”)?—</p>
         <p>                                             —“Whose trees<lb/>                              In Summer, yield him shade,<lb/>                                In Winter, fire.”—</p>
         <p>Well, that, at all events, is <hi rend="italic">my lot.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>And now, having given you all I can think of, I again close.</p>
         <p>Yours &amp;c.,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">No. 3!!</hi>
         </p>
         <p rend="end">Sunday night. <lb/>June 16th.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Not content with having already written you 2 letters, here I am going in for a 3rd.!—I did not get away yesterday for inland, as I had hoped, (mainly owing to the change in the weather,—though, now, today, it is quite fine again, &amp; so I may leave tomorrow,) and so I <hi rend="italic">add</hi> to what I have written.</p>
         <p>I have not been out since my last, but have heard a little news, and seen the Papers—<hi rend="italic">local</hi>, I mean.</p>
         <p>The Supreme Court has been sitting all the week, and the prisoners have all been (so far) convicted: it is sad to find some well educated, decent, persons among them, who have been drawn aside through drink &amp; <hi rend="italic">low </hi>company. You will see all about the trials in the Papers I send you. Toop’s case comes on tomorrow. Speaking, or writing, of trials, law &amp; lawyers, reminds me to say that I think there is plenty of such work “<hi rend="italic">brewing</hi>”. From all sides I hear what the Maoris are <hi rend="italic">going to do</hi>; led on by this fellow Rees. In the “Wananga” of yesterday is a scathing article, as against the occupiers of Pov. Bay lands (no doubt by Rees),—and I see, in Maori, a long carefully drawn up Paper from the Maori Chiefs there, informing Archdn. Williams &amp; others (Read’s Executors)—who <hi rend="italic">very generously</hi> had put out an advertisement, calling on all who thought they had claims, or felt aggrieved, to see them, &amp; they would entertain their claims liberally,—as they (Wms. &amp; Co.,) did not like Law nor wish to go to Law,—well, the Maoris there laugh at that! say, they will go to Law, supported by <hi rend="italic">their friend Rees</hi>, and will contest inch by inch!!—</p>
         <p>You will see In the papers what R. has got from the Govt. <hi rend="italic">in shape of costs</hi>! for a paltry trial of only a few hours;—talk of Gussy C. (&amp; Luff), or Allen (&amp; Colenso)! ’twas a mere flea-bite in comparison! Renata is bringing up Donelly!! (D. who married his niece! but wholly <hi rend="italic">against</hi> R’s. wish,) for shooting over his land! All the natives (&amp; many of the whites, too,) have had advts. forbidding it, &amp; threatening prosecution, &amp;c. Hapuku’s <hi rend="italic">last words</hi> in Eng. &amp; Mao. are published in “Wananga,”—forbidding the draining, or any attempt to drain, or alter Poukawa Lake; &amp; signed by nearly all resident chiefs—that they will strictly uphold it.</p>
         <p>Arrow is prosecuting Jno. Harding for defamation, at last Election. Hope Harding may be mulcted,—I was going to write, <hi rend="italic">&amp; </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">taught</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> better manners</hi>, but this I fear is impossible. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> has ever had a <hi rend="italic">nasty hard mouth.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>New School Inspr. cannot yet get a house to suit his fancy, so he has again advertised for one—but <hi rend="italic">leaving out</hi> the “½ ac. garden”; I have not yet seen him. I was told by a<hi rend="italic"> very good authority </hi>that Reignier, in talking w. <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, my authority, in the train <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Lee’s conduct towards me at Edn. Board,—R. said,—“that man! don’t mention his name to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>—he is a Judas”!!—</p>
         <p>Holder’s son is w. Bowerman at present, but I don’t think he likes this <hi rend="italic">little </hi>place, after big hustling Melbourne &amp; Dunedin; and <hi rend="italic">Woodville worse still</hi>! The heart of Holder, <hi rend="italic">Senr</hi>., is wholly set on W.</p>
         <p>Wesley has now <hi rend="italic">in his hands</hi> about ₤60. to credit; but, as certain Books I had expected from Trübner by this last mail have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come, <hi rend="underline italic">W.</hi> will procure them, as directed 2 months ago. Through this, &amp; the <hi rend="italic">probable</hi> forwarding of the L. Society’s publications, which (the large 4to. ones) I have directed him to get <hi rend="italic">Bound</hi>—W. will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have enough money <hi rend="italic">for all</hi> ordered &amp;c. If he says anything, you can tell him, <hi rend="italic">it is sure &amp; safe</hi> &amp; will be remitted immy. on receipt of Goods.—</p>
         <p>In last night’s paper the death of a man named <hi rend="italic">Anning</hi>, 44; he did live at Clive, &amp; was, in <hi rend="italic">our early</hi> times, a Policeman. John Dinwiddie, &amp; Peter, too, always wear Belltoppers!</p>
         <p>And so I will, once more say, Good-bye.</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">No. 4.</hi>
         </p>
         <p rend="end">Monday night, June 17.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Don’t let anyone know of this being No. 4! But having been in town today, &amp; seen a <hi rend="italic">few</hi>, &amp; heard a little news, I just scribble a few more lines to you—before I close—as I find I am already in for 1/- postage.—</p>
         <p>The day being fine, I went to see old Mrs. Craig,—poor soul, she has had a shock &amp; trial, but is, &amp; has been (as she allows) wonderfully supported under it. I was pleased in seeing the simplicity of her faith &amp; trust, and its sure fruits: both rare, now-a-days. Dear me, she reminded me of their calling on me at Waitangi “24 years ago,” when all my Books, she says, were on the floor, having been thrown down by the earthquake,—mine, being the <hi rend="italic">first house</hi> they had entered here, &amp;c., &amp;c. Possibly her daughter <hi rend="italic">may feel</hi> the blow <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than the dear old lonely mother.—</p>
         <p>In town I fell in w. Kinross &amp; had a nice long chat with him; I find that Hallett is prosecuting Ormond for expenses subdividing Run,—O. says, he is not laible &amp;c; we shall see. I saw <hi rend="italic">your </hi>friend Rev. Mr. Sidey, he looked well, <hi rend="underline italic">we only nodded in passing</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. </hi>Neal &amp; Close have commenced work, to carry out their new store as far as they can towards the sea, fronting Emerson St. The Curb in the street, ever-under-repair, (Tennyson St.) is again being carried on; the footpath is now raised so high under Tiffen’s fence that we can look over into his garden w. ease, while Wilson (Dentist’s) &amp; Tuxford’s fences are scarcely any protection!–</p>
         <p>I had seen in Saturday’s paper that yg. Burke had said (under examination as a witness), he was “<hi rend="italic">lately</hi> cashier at the U.B.”,—and I wished to know the meaning: I find that he has left the U.B. to enter into business in a firm at Gisborne: he <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be right; <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">so.</hi> ’Spose the old folks <hi rend="italic">there</hi> have somewhat to do in it. On meeting Kinross I told him he had some Hops sticking to his beard! He thanked me, &amp; said, that he had been smelling to some of Witty’s Hops; which, he said, were a very good sample. I see W. has an advt. in paper for a partner w. capital; I hope he may meet with a suitable response. This reminds me to inform you of D. Black’s letter (<hi rend="italic">enclosed</hi>), it arrived a day or two after the last Mail had left us; there is much of common-sense in what he says. I have asked Grubb to make all the <hi rend="italic">quiet </hi>enquiry he can about the value of your land at Wairoa, &amp; he promised to do so. (But this I surely must have told you in my last.) What Black says, about Witty’s <hi rend="italic">upset </hi>price being <hi rend="italic">too high</hi>, I have also heard from others.—</p>
         <p>I send you Papers up to the <hi rend="italic">last—</hi>today’s, &amp; also, tomorrow’s; from them you will learn all about our Sup. Ct. proceedings. In <hi rend="italic">this</hi> evening’s paper I see, Major Withers’ wife has a young ’un: at which I feel <hi rend="italic">shocked.—Don’t like it.—</hi>

         <p>Fannin sent me a note this mg.—thinking I was off to Waipukurau.—F. says:— “Mr. Hill came out in the same ship w. Willie<note xml:id="ftn2-331" place="foot" n="331"> Colenso’s son Wiremu, by now a mariner.</note> to Canterbury, and both he &amp; Mrs. Hill speak highly of him; and, as he says,— “I saw at once he (Willie) was a superior lad to either the Capt. or the Chief Officer, and I took a great fancy to him.” <hi rend="italic">Curious, is it not</hi>?” I have heard much of the same from Canterbury, from Clergymen &amp; ladies who were also passengers.—–</p>
         <p>I am just told by my man (from town, viii p.m.) that “Toop has got 12 months”—for cheating his creditors! <hi rend="italic">Kapai</hi>: serve him right! </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Another Bankrupt</hi> I see in this evening’s paper!!</p>
         <p>Now I think <hi rend="italic">you are </hi>in my debt for letter writing.</p>
         <p>A very fine day this, and I am in good health; thanks be to the <hi rend="italic">Great Giver</hi>.</p>
         <p>Good-bye. Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
