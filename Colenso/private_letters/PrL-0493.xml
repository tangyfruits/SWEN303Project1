         <p rend="end">Napier, March 30/82</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I was doubly pleased (if I may so write) in receiving the printed sheets of my Miscellaneous papers, vol. xiv., from you on Tuesday night (28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) by overland mail: and as you wished them to be “returned at once,” I now do so, with only a few errata,—some of them though small being common “<hi rend="italic">printer’s</hi> errors” ought not to have been in such <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> work as this of yours. At one or two I laughed heartily, particularly at Ulysses’ 2 <hi rend="italic">Boats</hi>!! and I think you will too.—</p>
         <p>I have said I was <hi rend="italic">doubly</hi> pleased,—this I will explain. According to arrangement, I was to have left Napier on 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. (Monday) for the “70 m. Bush”; but the news to hand of increasing sickness there, caused me to put it off,—and here I am still! <hi rend="italic">Had I gone</hi>, you could not have had a reply from me until <hi rend="italic">after 20</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. </hi>April!—therefore I was <hi rend="italic">pleased</hi> at being still here.</p>
         <p>Little did I think when writing to Mr. Gore on 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.—by the steamer from Auckland—that <hi rend="italic">you were in her</hi>: this I only found last Saturday night from “N.Z. Mail” of that date. I, or <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, had hoped to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> you here, on your return,—together with Mr. Maskell. Mentioning his name, reminds me to say <hi rend="italic">to you</hi>,—how pleased I was to see his paper in “Journal of Science” on the wonderful &amp; mysterious Weka pass paintings!! But as I suppose you are <hi rend="italic">busy </hi>I must not trouble you with a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter.—</p>
         <p>With this I send <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a Report of our late Annl. Meeting, &amp;c. I had purposely detained it till I should hear of your return.</p>
         <p>And with kind regards and every good wish—</p>
         <p>Believe me, my dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. By last Mail I sent £75. to Engd. to purchase Books for Institute.</p>
