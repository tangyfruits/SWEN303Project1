         <p rend="end">Napier, New Zealand,<lb/>January 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>, 1895.</p>
         <p>My dear nephew William</p>
         <p>My last to you (and a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> one) was on 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Novr.—that I trust you have long ago received, and with your sister acted on.</p>
         <p>I wrote to Mr. Julyan, <hi rend="italic">as your Mayor</hi>, and including also the Corporation of the Borough, a fortnight ago: which letter will I suppose have been received, and perhaps considered by you (as a body) before this can reach you. Possibly you may have been surprised at the contents of that letter: however, it was <hi rend="italic">no new thing with me</hi>, for that <hi rend="italic">same </hi>sum has been given by me for that purpose at my decease, in my former will: but I considered it better (as things are in this country—<hi rend="underline italic">now</hi>!) to carry out myself and at once my old intention. I trust, that Mr. Julyan with you all Borough Councillors will promptly accede to my offer, and that I may soon hear from you &amp; them to that effect. And do <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—as my nephew &amp; representing me there in my native town—<hi rend="italic">see</hi> that <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> is well &amp; securely done</hi>. I suppose that you may have heard long ago, from your Father (my Brother) what <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, as a family, had to endure in the olden times: and it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> that I am rich, or have <hi rend="italic">much </hi>to leave, that I now do this; but because I wish, as a <hi rend="italic">faithful </hi>steward, to do what is in my power, and is right to aid suffering humanity.</p>
         <p>I have sent you some Papers lately, which may have interested you, especially my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> long letter (No. VI.) published at Xmas:—this one, of course, caused some surprise here, even among my own friends! as this generation was entirely ignorant of my old warfare—fighting with the enemy in days of old! and I have received plenty of sound <hi rend="italic">Protestant </hi>thanks.</p>
         <p>By this Mail I send you a Paper, giving an account of our <hi rend="italic">grand doings here last Sunday</hi>: though the half is not told. I have been <hi rend="italic">very busy </hi>of late, and did hope and arrange for leaving Napier <hi rend="italic">this week </hi>on my deferred Xmas. holiday: but I have had to postpone it, and remain for Ch. duty at St Augustine’s, 2–3 Sundays, the Minister of that Church having <hi rend="italic">suddenly resigned</hi>.—–</p>
         <p>Find time to write me a full and clear letter on <hi rend="italic">all </hi>these subjects here touched on.—</p>
         <p>I am keeping well: “a wonder,” as they tell me: hope you &amp; yours are well also.—</p>
         <p>           With much love,</p>
         <p>                           Believe me to be,</p>
         <p>                                   Your affectionate Uncle,</p>
         <p>                                                   W. Colenso.</p>
