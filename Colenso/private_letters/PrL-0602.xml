         <p rend="end">NAPIER June 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> 1885</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have to thank you for your welcome friendly letter of the 6th, also the specimen sent with it. Much pleased I was to find your family all well, and again at their “Ain Hame”.</p>
         <p>As I am thinking of going off to the Bush again on Friday morning next &amp; this week being also Eng mail week, I write to you now—to make sure of it; for I have been writing all day (&amp; yesterday)—and my hand &amp; arm are feeling as if half cramped.</p>
         <p>Thanks for your nice little specimen; I believe you are right as to its being an <hi rend="italic">Olearia</hi>, and perhaps <hi rend="italic">solandri</hi>—but of this I am not quite sure, and I have set it aside for further examn.</p>
         <p>I am pleased in finding you are keeping your eyes open for plants,—go on and prosper; of course, as a good fellow, remembering me. I intend going as far S as Woodville (looking after some t’other side—of honest fellows ? a hateful job,) but I shall halt by the way &amp; only travel in <hi rend="italic">fine w.</hi> so I may not return till (say) 2nd week in July. Should your heart be overflowing with love and good feelings, and so lead you to write to me in the Bush, address to me at Norsewood, as that will be my headquarters.</p>
         <p>I suppose you saw the account of our Society’s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> meeting for 1885 in the “Herald”; I went thither in <hi rend="italic">pouring</hi> rain &amp; pitchy dark; tumbled 3 times onto the “lee scuppers” in going down the hill; the weather kept many away, but I was pleased to see Mr Kinross there—it reminded me of <hi rend="italic">old</hi> times. I have not yet received a volume of “Trans” (XVII) but Hamilton <hi rend="italic">showed</hi> one at the meeting (isnt to hand for the library), &amp; mournfully told us—there were <hi rend="italic">no</hi> papers in it from the H.B.Ph.Inst!!. The rest I must leave till we meet—if we ever shall do so—<hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>
         <p>The weather is still bright &amp; glorious: <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> this mng, more so, I fancy with you.­—</p>
         <p>P.D. has also called; he looked very well. And now <hi rend="italic">Good</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">bye</hi>. Re­member “Auld lang syne”.</p>
         <p>With kind regards to all—</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso.</p>
