         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Decr. 6/71</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I will now answer that kind &amp; friendly poportion of your letter of 16 ulto.—the main &amp; pressing business part having been concluded. I should have written before, or by “Ashley” which left here this day—but I <hi rend="italic">could not</hi>.—(You know John Carling, our late R.M.,—well, all this week I have been trying to get up a small sum to enable him to leave here next week for Sydney—friends few (in hour of need) and money still scarce.)</p>
         <p>In that last letter of yours, you kindly say, you would send me the peculiar Ngaitahu words you had, if I wished. <hi rend="italic">Please, </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">do so</hi>. Get them from Mackay <hi rend="italic">as soon as possible</hi>, and forward them.</p>
         <p>I have been “lying on my oars” of late anent my Dicty. owing to my hand (the Doctors wanted “absolute rest for a year” or so,—and it is only at times that I can write legibly at all, &amp; without pain, but my hand is a little better now.) Yet I hope to be going on again shortly.—Perhaps all the faster &amp; better for resting. Albeit I have <hi rend="italic">no pay</hi> from the Govt.—I shall never trouble them again for any on this account.—</p>
         <p>No doubt I shall be glad to see your “Botanist’s Paper—in Tahiti 30 yrs. ago.”—Why did you, or Dr.H., never think of making me a Member of your Instit.? I was asked from Auckland (long ago) to become a M.—I said, No: Wellington—I suppose.</p>
         <p>Doyle is already fencing &amp;c. I suppose you received Draft, all right. If I don’t hear from you (anent the Ngaitahu words) in 2 months, you must allow me to trouble you again.—</p>
         <p>Heartily wishing you a happy N. Year! I am    Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                                                                             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>I had (and have) thought of paying a visit to Engld. but fear I must give it up—mainly through want of <hi rend="italic">funds.</hi> W.C.</p>
