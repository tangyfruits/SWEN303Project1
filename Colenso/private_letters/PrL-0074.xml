         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Hawke’s Bay, N. Zealand,<lb/>Septr. 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1848.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>The usual little trading vessel having just arrived from Wellington, affords me the opportunity (long desired) of transmitting you the accompanying papers.—Being Copies of a Correpondence between H.M. Colonial Government and myself; together with sundry other Papers (“enclosures”), elucidatory of certain facts therein contained or adverted to. Although the matter is now at rest (as far as I am concerned), I have, nevertheless, deemed it my duty to send you Copies of every paper; (although to do so I have had to fag hard indeed,) lest you might hear of a <hi rend="italic">part</hi> only of the business, and so not be able to form a correct judgment thereupon.—His Excellency the Lieut-Governor behaved very kindly to me when at Wellington, paying me every attention. I dined and spent two nights with him during my short stay there. On leaving, he presented me with a Copy of his travels in Australia. He also sent me Mr. Fitzgerald’s letter to his private secretary for my perusal, &amp;c., on which I took a copy of it. I may truly enough say, that I am right glad the affair is now over;—more on account of my not having any time for such matters, as well as an utter disinclination thereto, than because I <hi rend="italic">care</hi> for them. The Whites generally in the Wairarapa District (not to mention those who are nearer to and within <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>Wellington,) are still greatly incensed against me; and will be so, until one or other changes. Yet there are one or two honorable exceptions, who love and receive me for my work’s sake. Would to God, my dear Sirs, you could send some <hi rend="italic">strong sound </hi>Minister for that valley, who would look after that end of this immense parish! In a little while it will be, perhaps, too late. God has given me great influence over the whole fo these Tribes; still I fear much for that part of my parish, it is very exposed.</p>
         <p>In a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> packet which accompanies this, I send you nine months of my Journal, which leaves me still <hi rend="italic">one year</hi> in arrear! when I shall <hi rend="italic">close</hi> quite up, I cannot say: I work, almost night &amp; day: I hope, howeve, to take another portion on with me to Wellington, when I travel that way next month.</p>
         <p>There is great change talking place (I may almost dare to say, an alteration for the better) among the Tribes immediately about us. Two, out of the four, principal Chiefs of this district (Tareha and Kurupou) have lately embraced the Faith with all their followers, many of whom are now Candidates for Baptism. And of the other two Chiefs (Te Hapuku and Puhara), the eldest son of Te Hapuku has also become a Candidate for Baptism, and the young brother of Puhara, and several of his relations, and also <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>professing to the Faith. This last year has been a harvesting one to the visible Church in N. Zealand. Many Chiefs of note throughout the District have been Baptized. Many have learned to read. The no. of Communicants is every where increasing; and the Papists, too, are casting their follies away for the Truth as it is in Jesus. But we have, on the other hand much to deplore; the stumbling of some, and the wilful obstinacy of others, and <hi rend="italic">our own coldness</hi>. I am now in my fifteenth year of Service to the C.M.S.,—and never at any period did I feel so dead, so sinfully dead, as at present, yet I am daily endeavoring to fulfil my many duties, and to stay myself upon the unchangeable mercy of God in Christ Jesus. We all need, greatly need, the Life-invigorating spirit, to quicken the dwarfish graces of our souls. May <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, in mercy, remember us for good! My annual Teachers’ School has just closed; 21 Teachers and Monitors from all parts of the District were here, as usual, for a fortnight’s close exercise. The benefit arising from this school is very great; it causes a propulsion of sound blood to the remotest extremities of the body. We were visited, during the summer &amp; autumn with the Hooping Cough, which took away several children, and tried the Faith of many parents, but, I bless <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, not one has cast away his hope, as formerly upon such occasions. From several who have been thus sorely<hi rend="bold">[4]</hi> tried, I have had affecting and cheering letters—evidencing the reality of their Faith;—precious indeed, and always in the sight of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, though often unseen by us.—But there is much to do; and much of Divine Wisdom &amp; Teaching is now needed, to train aright these feeble plants, as well as to water &amp; shelter them. Another matter, (little enough in itself, but of great tendency to the promotion of good,) I may also mention:—158 men &amp; women of this District, have during the past year, voluntarily relinquished smoking <hi rend="italic">Tobacco</hi>.</p>
         <p>I know not whether the Letters I have sent to you from this place, have ever reached your hands; I have not heard of such having been acknowledged by you in any of your Public Letters to us. I do not go to Committee at Turanga, as my doing so would occupy (at <hi rend="italic">least</hi>) 5 weeks; and I have so very much travelling, and not a scrap of time to spare. There is one thing which I have often considered to be almost without precedent or fellow, namely, <hi rend="italic">my not having a single clerical </hi>(I may almost add, Christian) <hi rend="italic">Correspondent in the whole world</hi>! Excepting a <hi rend="underline italic">few</hi> of my brethren in N. Zealand. I sometimes feel alone on these lonely shores. I think this ought not to be.</p>
         <p>For Paper, Pencils, Pens, Ink &amp; Rubber, lately received, you have my best thanks on behalf of the Natives. I am greedy enough to wish I had <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>four times the quantity. I am sadly off for Prayer- and Elementary- Books. To a party of forty, who lately came over to the Faith, I was oblige to arrange for them to use the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> prayer night &amp; morning (which they had got by heart), not having a single book to give them. I have given out upwards of 200 Testaments during the last 2 months: the greater number of the applicants, now received the Word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> for the first time.—My little press, too, is working, spite of all difficulties and impediments; my old Native lad, Samuel, being Compositor &amp; pressman;—the correcting, &amp;c, of course I have to attend to.—We have printed some (25) experimental &amp; Doctrinal Hymns, (composed in Native <hi rend="italic">Idiom</hi>,) which will (under <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>) be of Service against error;—also, a little Tract, the happy death of a little Sunday Scholar, which has already done good;—and a prayer, &amp;c., for Catechumens;—and we are now printing a Catechetical work (based on those of Dr. Watts’) in which we are advanced to the 24 p.—but we get on but very slowly from want of type, &amp;c., being only able to print 2 pages at a time.</p>
         <p>Our Congregations, too, at the Station, have greatly increased, instead of from 50 to 70, as formerly, there are now from 80 to 160 and 200; and, although more than three fourths of those who attend have to come several miles, they are seldom absent on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Day, generally coming on the Saturday afternoon, bringing their food, &amp;c., with them, and remaining <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>until after Monday morning’s School.—</p>
         <p>I have not time now to add any more. Save to desire and crave interest in your prayers: &amp; to express a hope, that amidst the confusion and disorder which at present is so very conspicuous throughout Europe, our Native land may be in mercy preserved.</p>
         <p>I am, my Dear Sirs, </p>
         <p>Your mo. ob. servant</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
