         <p>To Capt Hobson R.N.<lb/>Lieut Govr.<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Your very kind Note of the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Decr., I duly received, and would pray Your Ex. to pardon my not embracing the first opportunity of answering the same. I put off the doing so until I could forward a copy of the “Gazette” which Your Excellency has been pleased to honor me with the execution of. Herewith I send a copy for Yr. Excellency’s Inspection, which I trust will give satisfaction.</p>
         <p>I shall, I trust, be enabled (during the present exigency) to execute what little printing Your Excellency may require <hi rend="italic">as</hi> a “Gov. Gazette”, but as my present duties are exceeding onerous, and as I have no one to assist me, in the compostg., &amp;c—I would humbly suggest, that the “Gazette” be published once a month, and that the Notices &amp;c be made as brief as possible.</p>
         <p>Awaiting Yr. Excellency’s comms.</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>My dr Sir</p>
         <p>Yrs try</p>
         <p>W.C.</p>
         <p>Decr. 30/40.</p>
