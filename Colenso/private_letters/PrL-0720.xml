         <p>Mr. R.C. Harding</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I cannot tell you how very much disappd. I was in neither hearing from you, nor seeing you before I left Napier. (Not even an acknowledgement for cheque sent!!—which I suppose you recd.) And so at meeting last week—I had hoped you might come <hi rend="italic">early</hi> as you often do,—or had stayed after its close:—&amp; when I was in town, the next day (final visit), I told Ferguson, I was going to your Office to see you—but, alas! I was hindered, &amp; it was late.</p>
         <p>I am here <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, for health: hoping to get rid of the <hi rend="italic">remainder </hi>of my cough and cold—and though weather has been none of the best since I left Napier, I do believe I am already much better: I shall not return early to Napier.</p>
         <p>I shall thank you to give Bearer for me 3 copies of the “Tide Lore” pamphlet:—I have some at my house, but he would not know where to find them: &amp; the 1 copy I brought with me I have given away—down S.—–</p>
         <p>I hope you &amp; yours are all well—also your Father: please remember me to him.</p>
         <p>And w. kind regards,</p>
         <p>I am, yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Should you issue next “Typo” early—send copy to me here.                                                W.C.</p>
