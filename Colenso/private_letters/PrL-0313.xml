         <p>My dear Sir Donald</p>
         <p>Your note of this day found me down in Milton Road “mending my ways”!—or I should have sent what I now send by your man.</p>
         <p>I send herewith 3 more Books received by last Mail, which I know (if you have time) will interest you: 2 of them are very lately published.</p>
         <p>I shall endeavour to see Mr. Ormond tomorrow, but I fear he will be much too busy to allow me <hi rend="italic">an hour</hi>! or, half of that period. I will gladly see you early.—</p>
         <p>Could you send a telegram to your Govt. Printer—to know what may have been printed of those Mss. of mine you caused to be passed on to him for that purpose:—and if <hi rend="italic">in time</hi>, to send to you copies of the same per Rangatira?</p>
         <p>How are you off for <hi rend="italic">fruit</hi>? I would hazard the sending you some <hi rend="italic">ripe peaches</hi> (such as the rains have left!) but I suppose you may have <hi rend="italic">better</hi>—still should you care for any, I will <hi rend="italic">gladly send </hi>you plenty:—<hi rend="italic">and if so please let me know.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Hoping you are well. I am</p>
         <p>     Dear Sir Donald</p>
         <p>             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
