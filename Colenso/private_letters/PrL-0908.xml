         <p rend="end">Napier, 11/ix, ’94</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Although I wrote to you on the 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. from Wdv., I feel inclined to do so again this evg.—not <hi rend="italic">caring </hi>either to read or to write! (Bad sign this?) The truth, however, is, that I went to town early this mg. (ix.30) &amp; returned at xii. tired &amp; worn (&amp; vexed! at finding <hi rend="italic">no one </hi>in office whom I wished &amp; had arranged to see)—my first <hi rend="italic">day </hi>visit to town for a month—&amp; the sun was very powerful—after such a long spell of wet &amp; cold.—</p>
         <p>I returned, in storm! on Fridy night from Wdv.-cum-Dvk., &amp; found Mr<hi rend="underline">s</hi> Anderson ill in bed, a woman in attendance on her, &amp; Dr. de L. also visiting 2–3 times a day! Had I but known this—I would have remd. in Bush a little longer. On my way down—I heard at Waipawa of the death of Noah Huke (whom you will remember)—this grieved me, as I had hoped to go &amp; see him. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, on arrival, I heard of the deaths of Henare Matua, and of John Heslop. (Perhaps I told you in my last, my meeting Heslop in town, just before I went inland, &amp; remarking how feeble he seemed, &amp; I told him so—w. an affect. parting request— “<hi rend="italic">put your whole trust in </hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps italic">God</hi>”.) Yesterday I heard of the death of yg. Humphries—a few days before of the death of Nesbit’s son, and this evg. of the death of Pope’s wife, and last Saturday of an <hi rend="italic">old </hi>hand—a carpenter residing in Milton Road, named Obadiah Onien: so there is a pretty strong death-roll for you!——</p>
         <p>Notwithstanding, that is not what I specially cared to write; but about our Inst. Meeting last night (seeing next to nothing <hi rend="italic">re </hi>same in our Papers) and to send you the Report of Marine Engineers <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Breakwater, just published.—–</p>
         <p>1.) Of our Meeting: I went (contrary to custom—winter night) because I saw, flaring advts. &amp; notices <hi rend="italic">re </hi>grand doings at Th. Royal, under Mayor Swan,—and I wished to support Dr. Moore:—T. clock struck viii. while I was going thither: found several, Hill among them: Humphries (Prest.) cod. not attend—his son having just died: ere long, Hill propd. I should be Chn., I demurred, asking <hi rend="italic">him </hi>“If he were not V.P.?” “No”. And so I presided—rather unwillgy.—becaiuse <hi rend="italic">before leaving </hi>house, I had determined not to rem. to hear Taylor Wh’s. infliction—seeing Buller has so <hi rend="italic">many </hi>big 4to. closely ptd. pps. on the “<hi rend="italic">Kea</hi>”. Dr. M. began in his usual old way! never did I hear such a <hi rend="italic">bad </hi>reader of his own paper, yet (<hi rend="italic">Irishm</hi>.-like) always <hi rend="italic">good-humouredly </hi>&amp; never once betrayg. consciousness!! I soon found, he had <hi rend="italic">largely </hi>copied from Darwin—sentences &amp; pars., &amp;c &amp;c he told us—his paper was written some years ago, &amp; he had <hi rend="italic">intended </hi>to go over it privy. but had not found time—&amp; so was often at a loss over his own writing! fol. fcp. &amp; on both sides! ominous to look at. However, as all things have an end so his P.—at ix.20—all hands exhibiting being tired—then the never-failing solace— “Coffee”: but <hi rend="italic">noone </hi>for me! Stay—I am running ahead: at conclusion of P. (<hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, only,) I put the usual qu., &amp; finding <hi rend="italic">no </hi>response, I said a few words—by way of <hi rend="italic">clearing</hi>, &amp; w. reference espy. to Darwin—<hi rend="italic">asking Mr. Hill</hi>, close by, “If he had met w. any fossil corals?” This brought him up—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> “he would take it up <hi rend="italic">after Coffee</hi>”—(long waiting): so they all hands went in for it, &amp; I do think enjoyed themselves, but (as over other drinks) that <hi rend="italic">over</hi>, they began to be loquacious, and after some time allowed, by me! I was obliged to rap my knuckles loudly on table to get silence, &amp; to resume labours. And so Hill began—no doubt he had been preparing for it: H. was convinced, long ago, that Darwin was wrong in his statement <hi rend="italic">re </hi>formation &amp;c &amp;c of the Coral Islands: H. floundered a good deal (he often does, I think, in speaking) and seemed—wound up for a very long spin! However, he, too, at last! ceased: I (finding no one else would speak) again said a few words, on Hill’s remarks, reminding him, that <hi rend="italic">our </hi>limestone was all <hi rend="italic">recent</hi>, &amp;c—somewhere about x., play no. I was ended: then, no. II T. Wh’s. “<hi rend="italic">Kea</hi>”: the monstrous ms., fol. fcp. closely written both sides, with several cross bits or slips (1–2 in. wide) added thereto: I asked D., “If he were going to read it?” He sd. “No—leave till next Mtg.”: this was put &amp; carrd. (<hi rend="italic">gladly</hi>), and <hi rend="italic">heoi ano</hi>! D. had drawn <hi rend="italic">many </hi>diagrams on 2 blk. boards &amp;c—of <hi rend="italic">anatomy </hi>of coral polypes—but (while pleasing to the <hi rend="underline italic">Dr</hi>.) there was too much of tentacles &amp; ganglions, &amp;c, &amp;c. in Gordian Knots!! I returned by x.30—<hi rend="italic">tired. </hi>Audience about 30.—–</p>
         <p>2.) Report <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Breakwater: I have just glanced at it: you will also have report of the Harb. Bd. mtg. <hi rend="italic">re same</hi>, some pertinent obsns. by Ed. “D.T.” on it. One thing is <hi rend="italic">certain</hi>—plenty more of <hi rend="italic">rates</hi>! Saturday was wet <hi rend="italic">and windy</hi>, <hi rend="underline italic">Sunday</hi> a <hi rend="italic">dense fog</hi>, which <hi rend="italic">never lifted for 36 hours</hi>! A true Wdv. one! such as I <hi rend="italic">had never before seen in N., </hi>and so sd. Fielder &amp; others (old hands) today. Consy. I did not go out<lb/>—until last nt., &amp; this mg.—Returning to Dvk. from Wdv. I was surprised to see<hi rend="italic">Pritchard</hi>, formerly of Farndon, “<hi rend="italic">Quite well </hi>&amp; jolly”. A wonderful alteration, &amp; he <hi rend="underline italic">is well</hi>. Bierre has pleaded “Guilty”—the best thing he cod. do—as I told them at Dvk.—where <hi rend="italic">his </hi>lawyer was trying hard to get <hi rend="italic">first </hi>respect. folks to come forward &amp; speak <hi rend="italic">in favour </hi>of him!!! Sentence deferred till Thursday. I saw Mr. Sidey in town today, <hi rend="italic">bearing </hi>up, also Mr. Paterson, Craig, Crerar, and others—plenty folks! “Assizes time”. A strikingly good charge from Judge <hi rend="italic">Pd</hi>. in this evg’s. paper—I shall send it. </p>
         <p>12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Send this mys. H. instead more full. I got your paper sent, this mg., Hone Heke is partly right, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the proper Mao. names—but <hi rend="italic">not </hi>P<hi rend="underline">e</hi>toone—P<hi rend="underline">i</hi>toone: and for Kaiwhara—the old &amp; true Mao. name was Kaiwharawhara—W<hi rend="underline">h</hi>anganui of course: I note what Heke is reported to have said <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Maori vernacular at Whanganui, and I believe, that <hi rend="italic">much </hi>of that is to be set down to Taylor!!—</p>
         <p>Very sorry am I to see—in this evg’s. paper—that the <hi rend="italic">only </hi>reserved estates of 2 Maori chiefs of (old) rank were <hi rend="italic">sold </hi>by auction—<hi rend="italic">at suit </hi>of <hi rend="italic">old </hi>mortgage to <hi rend="underline italic">H.R.R.</hi>—with, of course. ever repeating Interest!—H.R.R. was always a perfect Shylock w. the Maoris! Yet <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> carefully written <hi rend="italic">law</hi>—<hi rend="italic">biding his time</hi>: and son-in-law Gd. takes after him.</p>
         <p>Have <hi rend="italic">not yet heard </hi>of Eccles return to Wdv., sad suspense this! I wrote yesty. to know: Robert is down town <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, if I hear tonight I will mention it; Robert’s wife <hi rend="italic">is better</hi>.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Another sad </hi>tale in “D.T.” this evg. of a yg. m. named Cooper—I will send it.</p>
         <p>Now I do <hi rend="italic">not </hi>write that you may write <hi rend="italic">at once </hi>to me: you are (I trust) well employed in P.O. &amp; so, my good friend, <hi rend="italic">stick to that and </hi>yr. Domc. duties—<hi rend="underline italic">never mind me</hi>.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">This night </hi>is a glorious one! sky cloudless, Luna serenely grand: no wind; air warm: <hi rend="italic">such a contrast</hi>.</p>
         <p>1x. p.p. R. just returned—but <hi rend="italic">no letter </hi>from Mr. Eccles. So</p>
         <p>Good night. I trust this may find you all well, &amp; your dear son Victor <hi rend="italic">much better</hi>.</p>
         <p>And w. kind regards,</p>
         <p>Believe me, yours sincy.</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. another beautiful day!</p>
