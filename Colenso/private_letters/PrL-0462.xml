         <p rend="end">Napier, Friday Aug 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1881</p>
         <p>Mr John Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Thanks many &amp; big for your long &amp; welcome latter of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I have been thinking of writing to you all this week (and I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> wish that I had done so), &amp; as your mail leaves tomorrow I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write now;­—</p>
         <p>I received the little box you so kindly sent me, pretty nearly all right—the 2 larger insects had their legs &amp; horns crushed—or broken off by the lid; there was a wee bit too much cotton in the bot­tom. And here let me tell you, that the box itself (empty) scarcely weighs 1oz and you can always send me such a box, with specimens, at the cost of 1d stamp,—which carries the box, or packet, up to 2oz. I get and send away several such boxes, I find them very handy.—The letter too, was but a <hi rend="italic">bare bit over</hi> the ½oz. I have just weighed it, and I find that had you left out the <hi rend="italic">last memo</hi> (written on a small piece of paper) your letter would have been <hi rend="italic">under</hi> ½oz, so that, for the future, 3 <hi rend="italic">such</hi> sheets of note paper, as you used, with the envelopes can always come for the one<hi rend="italic"> </hi>2d stamp.</p>
         <p>Now for the insects you sent;—1. The fine longnosed fellow; this is a species of <hi rend="italic">Brenthus</hi>; there are 2 or 3 known ones in N.Z. at present. I cannot say if this one is <hi rend="italic">new</hi>; it will require careful microscopical examination (which I hope to give it shortly) but if you can procure and send me some more do so; the M &amp; F differ much from each other. 2. The other long horned one, is one of the Cerambyx family, this one I shall also examine &amp; report on. 3. The little hard long caterpillar like one, is a <hi rend="italic">larva</hi> of some insect, (that is in its immature state), it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a <hi rend="italic">centipede</hi>; this latter we have here in our garden, formerly they were <hi rend="italic">very numerous</hi>; I had one in spirits that was 9in long, &amp; I have seen them larger at the N!. I believe their bite is poisonous;—in this country. 4. The 2 wing-cases you found in the Spiders nest (or hole), will prove to be of some service; I think they belong to a <hi rend="italic">Coptomma</hi>; but more <hi rend="italic">anon</hi>. 5. I thank you for the Spiders, &amp; for all your infor­mation; &amp; I fancy we may yet know more about them as the summer and long days come on; &amp; you have any spare time; should you gain any more <hi rend="italic">during all September </hi>send them to me as before;—</p>
         <p>Any &amp; all insects (even minute ones as big as a flea;) will be ac­ceptable; of course I do not mean the very common ones, as Blue Bottle flies, &amp;c. I am much pleased at your kind thoughtfulness in sending a bot­tle to the “Bush”; hope it may soon be filled. Should you ever come to town (N) on business, be very sure <hi rend="italic">to call</hi>.</p>
         <p>Did I not ask you in my former latter, if you also got <hi rend="italic">small</hi> Spiders, like you <hi rend="italic">first sent</hi>, in those holes? It is very much smaller than the other 3, &amp; I think it is the M one.</p>
         <p>My rheumatism still hangs about me; the weather has been wholly against me—but <hi rend="italic">Summer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> days are at hand. Hope you are all well and with kind regards &amp; best wishes,</p>
         <p>Believe me, Yours truly</p>
         <p>W . Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. As you may not have stamps always handy, I send you a few. Also 2 papers if you have digested Father Atten.</p>
         <p>Have had two kind &amp; long visits this week from Mr Fraser who leaves on Sunday.</p>
