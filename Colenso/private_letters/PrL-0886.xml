         <p>Dear Ethel,</p>
         <p>For several days I have been thinking much on you and on Woodville, and now I have determined to write you a little letter, that you and your brother may know—I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> forgotten you.—</p>
         <p>Perhaps you may wish to know, why I should be thinking on you, and on Woodville: and I will tell you. It was on this same Saturday in last year, 1892, that I was at Woodville for <hi rend="italic">the last time</hi>,—and, I think I said something in my last letter to you, written in September, about this month of November,—and, early last week, I wrote to Norsewood and to Dannevirke, saying, I should be there this week, and stay at Dannevirke tomorrow and, <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi>, go on to Woodville next week: but on last Sunday, 12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., I was taken very unwell, and so on Monday, that I could not commence my long journey on Tuesday, and then the heavy rain beginning (which has continued ever since), caused me to put off my intended visit to the Bush until the first week in December, when I hope to do so.—</p>
         <p>And now, dear Ethel, you know some of my reasons for having you and Woodville in mind. But I have another reason, I have lately heard, that the children at Woodville were suffering from <hi rend="italic">Diptheria</hi>, and so I thought on you, and your brother, who, when you last wrote to me, was laid up with Measles: I hope, however, you are both well and happy, and getting on nicely at School.—</p>
         <p>I suppose you have been having plenty of rain at Woodville: I do not know if fruit is early there, but here, they have Strawberries and Red Currants and Apricots in the fruit-shops, and, today, hot-house Grapes, very fine but very dear, 4s/6d per pound. I suppose you have plenty of fruit in your Father’s garden, I hope so, for your and your brother’s sake.—</p>
         <p>If you are quite well, and have any spare time, between next week and the first day of December, I should like for you to write a letter to me: perhaps you have long ago found out the answer, or the meaning of what I wrote to you about the sun.</p>
         <p>If I may be able to go to Dannevirke in December, as I have mentioned, I shall also try to go on to Woodville, and if I cannot do this, then I will write to you again.</p>
         <p>Give my love to your brother, and my kind regards to your Parents, and with a full share of love to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>:</p>
         <p>I am, Dear Ethel,</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
