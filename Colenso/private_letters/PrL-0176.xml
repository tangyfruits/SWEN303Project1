         <p rend="end">Napier, Saturday evening,<lb/>Novr. 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1864.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have just screwed down the 3 Cases of Sundries, intended for your Exhibition, of which I enclose an outline list.—</p>
         <p>I had no idea, when I commenced, I should send you so many, or have had so much trouble and labour: one reason of my doing so much for you, (apart from my hearty cooperation) is, <hi rend="italic">my having heard</hi> of but little being generally done in the N. Provinces. Of one thing I am pretty certain (both with regard to things now sent &amp; essay,) that whether I shall please or not, <hi rend="italic">I have really “worked with a will</hi>.”</p>
         <p>I wish—<hi rend="italic">on your account</hi>—our Assembly did not meet so soon, as, Had I more time, I could have put up what I send more satisfactorily: I leave on Thursday (17) for Auckland.</p>
         <p>Of the things now sent:—</p>
         <p>1. They are all packed <hi rend="italic">well</hi> by my own hand.</p>
         <p>2. Of the <hi rend="italic">Books</hi>: I had asked you about <hi rend="italic">Cook’s Voyages</hi>—but perhaps you overlooked it in your reply; I have however risked the sending them; as, if you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> got them, you will (I imagine) welcome them. I also send <hi rend="italic">Raoul</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">his</hi> plants &amp; plates are mostly Mid. Island,—and the classic <hi rend="italic">Forster</hi> (if only to compare the <hi rend="italic">first published </hi>drawings of <hi rend="italic">N.Z. plants</hi> with those in Hooker’s <hi rend="italic">Fl. Nov. Zel</hi>.,)—<hi rend="italic">Owen’s Moa </hi>&amp;<hi rend="italic"> Apteryx</hi> you wished, and I send with great pleasure: if <hi rend="italic">you can</hi>, get them bound in one, (we have no B. Binders <hi rend="italic">here</hi>,) I <hi rend="italic">will pay</hi>, &amp; so exhibit. I have enclose a Copy each of 2 of my <hi rend="italic">early</hi> publications on N.Z. <hi rend="underline italic">for you</hi>; &amp; hope you will do me the honor of accepting. I have also enclosed vol. II. of the <hi rend="italic">Tasman. Journal</hi>, and a No. of the <hi rend="italic">Annals. Nat Hist</hi>., each containing my little Monograph on the <hi rend="underline italic">Moa</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">both referred to by Owen in his large work</hi>),—in fact, that in the “Annals”, he himself sent thither to be printed;)—that however in Tasm. Jl. is the more full and popular. If your Juries should note any of our <hi rend="italic">bonâ fide</hi> N.Z. pubs., I hope they won’t overlook this. I regret not having a single copy left of that Monog. I leave it entirely with you to “<hi rend="italic">exhibit</hi>” the “Tasm. Jl.”, or “Annals” number, containing it, or not. You may smile at the lithographs in the T. Journal (i.e. those of the Moa bones)—but <hi rend="italic">at that time</hi> there was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> lith. artist in V.D.L.!! The Books, &amp;c., in Maori &amp; Eng. printed <hi rend="italic">in </hi>N.Z. were <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> done by myself, without assistant! Such (in those days) was not to be had <hi rend="italic">in </hi>N.Z., and I had no alternative but to gird up the tighter.—</p>
         <p>3. There are several choice &amp; unique things in case 2.—(be sure to <hi rend="italic">open</hi> the small round box, &amp; small tea chest of <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> sp. yourself,)—particularly</p>
         <p>α. <hi rend="italic">The Bell.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>β. <hi rend="italic">The geologl. sps. Antarctic lands:</hi> (the officers of that expedn. told me, “they were (to them) worth more than their weight in gold”—and I only got them through giving them of my own <hi rend="italic">stores</hi>.)</p>
         <p>γ. <hi rend="italic">The Land Shells</hi> (N.B. those corresponding Land shells mentioned in Dieffenbach’s work, vol. II (Gray’s Catalogue), were <hi rend="italic">surreptitiously </hi>published; <hi rend="italic">I </hi>discovered them, and gave to others (<hi rend="italic">under promise </hi>&amp;c.,) through whom they reached Gray!!</p>
         <p>δ. <hi rend="italic">The Fishhooks</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cord</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Carved Box</hi>.</p>
         <p>ε. <hi rend="italic">The 2 specimens in spirits</hi> (just put into <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> spirits (after 25 yrs.) &amp; look as well as ever!</p>
         <p>θ. <hi rend="italic">The Moa bones</hi>: (I had also mentioned <hi rend="italic">these</hi> to you, but you also overlooked it in replying: it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> prove to be a different sp. from any known—at all events different from your Southern sps. I have several of the smaller bones of <hi rend="italic">the same specimen</hi>, but I really cannot put up any more.—</p>
         <p>Of the Geological sps. in Case 3, I fear <hi rend="italic">you</hi> won’t think very highly. The N.Z. ones however are mainly from places where no professed Geologist has been; and I wished for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to see them—they might be serviceable. The one from Cape M.V. Diemen—the one from the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> of Maunganui (Tauranga Harbour,—2 or 3 fossils from H. Bay, &amp;c. please take care of—many are (to me) painful &amp; pleasing mementoes of the long past! I should greatly like to have your skilled opinion on a few of them. I have still a lot more.</p>
         <p>A word as to what I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sent, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>N.Z. Botanical specimens</p>
         <p>N.Z. sea, river, &amp; Lake shells</p>
         <p>N.Z. Fossils—</p>
         <p>N.Z. entomological sps. &amp;c</p>
         <p>These I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sent, wholly through want of time: my Fossils are not fit, being still in their matrices.—</p>
         <p>I believe our Local Commee. have <hi rend="italic">lately</hi> engaged a Mr. W. Faichney to go down and look after H. Bay things: but Mr. Wilkinson (to whom I shewed your &amp; Mr. Mason’s notes,) would rather my small numerous interesting things were sent to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>,—since you had so kindly undertaken, &amp;c.,—but Faichney can take <hi rend="italic">all onerous </hi>duty. I am sending an outline List of the articles to Mr. Wilkinson.</p>
         <p>I shall insure them as follows, Case, no.1 ₤60: 2, ₤150. 3, ₤40 = ₤250.</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pine Cones, </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">if wanted</hi>, might be sold: a few I sold here at 4/- ea.—</p>
         <p>If the essay I sent should be <hi rend="italic">well</hi>-printed (<hi rend="italic">in extenso</hi>, or nearly so), I should like to have, <hi rend="italic">extra and at my own expense</hi>, 200 additional Copies struck off: could you also manage this for me?</p>
         <p>If you should find time to scratch a line to me, do so to me at Auckland.—</p>
         <p>Heartily wishing your Exhibn. every success. Believe me</p>
         <p>     Yours very sincerely</p>
         <p>             Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S.</p>
         <p>Monday evg. 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>I now close. I have just seen Mr.Wilkinson, who strongly wishes to publish in our local Paper my <hi rend="italic">outline List </hi>furnished him, in order, if possible, to induce others &amp;c., and I have assented to his doing so. The 3 Cases are at the “Spit”—and will be carefully put on board the “<hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>” Str. tomorrow. It has just occurred to me, that you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> find the fresh (methyld.) spirits (which I put on the <hi rend="italic">Hatteria </hi>lizard) discolored—as I recollect using a piece of new <hi rend="italic">red</hi> sheep-skin (having no white) to tighten the large bung, &amp; the motion may extract the colour—if <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, and it requires new spirits, may I further trouble you to obtain such, &amp;c., and charge to me: and let me know the <hi rend="italic">amount</hi> of all expenses incurred for me, and I will remit.</p>
         <p>I am also sending you in addition (and at Mr. Wilkinson’s request) a handsome Carved Paddle.—Yours faithfy.</p>
         <p>             W.C.—</p>
