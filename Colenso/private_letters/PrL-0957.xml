         <p>Dear Sir James Hector</p>
         <p>A fortnight ago I sent my Botanical papers to you: and on the <hi rend="italic">very same day</hi> (at night,) I received a letter with specimens of a <hi rend="italic">Grass</hi>, from an old acquaintance in the interior, which I have since carefully examined, and finding it to be a new sp. have drawn up a description of it, and also obtained from him further information—and now forward my description to you: hoping to be quite in time to have it included in my last paper of <hi rend="italic">phænogams</hi>; it will, of course, come in <hi rend="underline italic">at the end</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">the last</hi>: and I will thank you to append it, and to number the pages.—</p>
         <p>What makes me the more desirous to have it appended and so published in your next vol., is the fact of my having received it last year (tufts only), and planted it in my garden, where however it died: also (as I said before) the probability of that Paper being <hi rend="italic">my </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">last</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> Botanical one</hi>.—</p>
         <p>You will be pleased in knowing that the Paper of last year— “On Letters &amp; Mails of the olden times”, (mentioned, Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. XXVII, p. 687,) supposed to have been lost or mislaid—<hi rend="italic">was never sent </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">to you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> at all</hi>! this I ascertained by dint of active research only a few days ago. </p>
         <p>   With kind regards I am,</p>
         <p>           Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>                           W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
   </text>
