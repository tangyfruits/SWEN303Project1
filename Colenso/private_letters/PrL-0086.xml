         <p>My Dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>By this opportunity I send you another (and only a small) portion of my Journal, from Octr. 27/48 to Feby. 16/49, inclusive. I very much regret my not being able to send you more at this time: but I have done what I could.</p>
         <p>I enclose a copy of a Letter which I have just concluded to the Archdeacon of the District. From it you will learn somewhat of our situation &amp; trials during the present year.</p>
         <p>By next opportunity (D.V.) I will send you a Copy of the Appendix <hi rend="italic">translated</hi>, together with Copies of my Letters to the Bishop &amp; Lieut. Governor.</p>
         <p>I am now about to leave the Station on my usual Autumnal Journey.</p>
         <p>I have this day from an authentic source, heard, that another Scheme of the disaffected Natives is, to launch my boat &amp; to carry me forcibly into it and send me adrift!—But our Trust is in <hi rend="smallcaps italic">God</hi>!</p>
         <p>I have, I am happy to say, translated &amp; printed your Jubilee Letter in the Native language. I only received a Copy of it in November last.</p>
         <p>I have requested the Archdeacon when he goes to the Central Committee to pay £<hi rend="italic">10.0.0</hi>, as our donation towards the Jubilee Fund.</p>
         <p>With every respect, and craving an interest in your prayers.</p>
         <p>               I am,</p>
         <p>                       My dear Sirs</p>
         <p>               Your most ob. servt.</p>
         <p>                       William Colenso.</p>
