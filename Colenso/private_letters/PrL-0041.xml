         <p rend="end">Paihia, Sept. 27<lb/>1843</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Being about to sail, in the Columbine, for <hi rend="italic">Turanga</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mahia</hi>, and down below on that coast, I just drop you a line for old acquaintance sake. I heard you were at the Bay and could but regret that I was so far off as not to be able to render you the rites of hospitality. I hope you got back in safety to your dear family.</p>
         <p>Of course you have heard of Mrs. Fairburn’s death: a happy release for her from a severe state of suffering of long continuance. I have not the least doubt on my own mind of her having entered into rest. May the Lord prepare and enable us to follow! Mrs. Colenso felt it much, at first, but, I am happy to say, she is now pretty well.</p>
         <p>I am to be absent for 5 months—and to come back from beyond Hawke’s Bay all the way by land! I dare hope that the Lord will strengthen me for this work also. We sail in the Columbine, and we shall call at Auckland, Tauranga, Hick’s Bay, Tolaga Bay and Turanga: <hi rend="italic">ka pai</hi>! I see Capt. Fitzroy is to be Governor: I hope he will not forget his <hi rend="italic">old</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>. I had a letter from Dr. Hooker of H.M.S. “Erebus”, the other day, in which he says, “You must remember me kindly to Mr. and Mrs. Mair, their kindness to a total stranger I can never forget; tell them also that Abernethy is quite well and desires his kind remembrances.” They were 137 days out of sight of land, and were brought up in 78°10` S., just where they were before. They lost one man in doubling Cape Horn, and wintered at the Falkland Islands.</p>
         <p>Perhaps when I return—about the 18th. or 19th. of February, I may pass by your kainga. May the Lord ever bless you all, my dear <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>—and believe me</p>
         <p>               Very truly yours</p>
         <p>                               W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>(written in great haste)</p>
         <p>I heard from Mr. Puckey the other day he was quite well.</p>
