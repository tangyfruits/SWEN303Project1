         <p rend="end">Baddeley’s Hotel,<lb/>Dannevirke.<lb/>Novr. 12/87</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Hill—</p>
         <p>Your very kind note of the 8<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. from Gisborne reached me here last night, &amp; I thank you <hi rend="italic">heartily</hi> for it: I may truly say, it was <hi rend="italic">doubly welcome</hi>,—from the <hi rend="italic">unexpected</hi> pleasure, &amp; from the very great paucity of letters to me since I came hither.—</p>
         <p>I did not expect a reply from you to my note, shortly before you left Napier, knowing how very much you were tied for time: and I thank you for putting your name down to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> subsn. List: my reasons for asking <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to do so were, at least, 3-fold:—Your residence <hi rend="italic">at Canterbury</hi>: Sc. &amp; Lity. wk. in V. Haast’s <hi rend="italic">special line</hi>: <hi rend="italic">prominent Member </hi>of H.B. Ph. Inst. I had also placed a <hi rend="italic">list</hi> at ea. of our Banks, &amp; found <hi rend="italic">no one</hi> had come forward (to join Hamilton &amp; self), &amp; so I wished yr. name to appear; subsequently I wrote it myself on List at Bk.N.Z.—I fear, I shall not have <hi rend="italic">much</hi> to remit!—</p>
         <p>I am glad (to say the least of it) at <hi rend="italic">your</hi> being pleased w. “Jubilee” paper: I should have preferred writing it <hi rend="italic">unfettered</hi>; or giving it <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> from Notes; &amp; should have liked <hi rend="underline italic">several</hi> questions being put. I did expect a few Gentlemen present would have done so.—Did you see Hardcastle’s report in “Eg. News”? H. (or some one) “<hi rend="italic">wired</hi>” the Paper largely to Wgn., &amp;c.; from Wgn. I recd. copies from Editor:—&amp; I have recently heard of it having been reprinted at Auckland. Mr. Peacock (who sacrificed his <hi rend="italic">night’s </hi>wages to be present,) no doubt would have spoken,—but, poor dear fellow, he recd.—while in the room,—a telm. from Australia of the <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi> death of his Mother, whom he expected would visit him at Xmas.!! I have my doubts as to the irresponsible Board at Wgn. publishing it in vol. xx “Trans.”, (judging from the <hi rend="italic">past</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">who they are</hi>,) but even if so, it shall be printed here at Napier, with <hi rend="italic">additions</hi>.</p>
         <p>Mentioning your movements &amp; offl. duties—you say,— “I am due in the Bush on the <hi rend="underline italic">19</hi>
            <hi rend="sup underline italic">th</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">.</hi> of this mo.” Here, I think is a mistake, &amp; should be <hi rend="underline italic">2</hi>9<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. I shall not return till after <hi rend="underline italic">19</hi>
            <hi rend="sup underline italic">th</hi>—but <hi rend="italic">very soon </hi>after, having now entered on 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. week of absence.</p>
         <p>A few things have served to surprise me here:—1. Premier’s budget; (but, on the whole, good, if he can carry it out,): 2. Sale of Dr. Spencer’s Library: 3. Bowerman dissolving partp., &amp; removing to Auckld. I now begin to fear Dr. S. may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> return to us: he &amp; B. leaving togr. will be a loss to our Society. I wrote to Ham. early this week, &amp; I <hi rend="italic">now find</hi> that he has <hi rend="italic">only this mg.</hi> announced next meeting!! at which none of us (including yourself) can be present.</p>
         <p>I have done <hi rend="italic">very little </hi>here, this time, in the way of <hi rend="italic">novelties</hi>: I fear I am growing <hi rend="underline italic">lazy</hi>: but we have been having <hi rend="italic">plenty </hi>of<hi rend="italic"> rain</hi>,—all this week: thanks for the <hi rend="italic">pretty</hi> spn. you have sent me: I had heard of it (or a similar one) before from J.N. Williams, who told me he got it from near Manawarakau. Several of our <hi rend="italic">early</hi> flg. shrubs, &amp;c., are looking <hi rend="italic">charming</hi>, including your favourite, <hi rend="italic">O. ornata. </hi>I hope this may find you <hi rend="italic">well</hi>: also Mrs. Hill and family: I am keeping well: </p>
         <p>with very kind regards, I am, Dr Sir <lb/>Yours sincerely, W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>13<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. (Sunday)</p>
         <p>Since writing foregoing, I have recd. a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter from a Mrs. Featon of Gisborne—enquiring <hi rend="italic">re </hi>plants: and as she mentions <hi rend="italic">your name</hi> I suppose <hi rend="italic">I am indebted to you</hi>. I have just replied—adding (as before to others), I <hi rend="italic">cannot </hi>take up with any <hi rend="italic">new </hi>correspondents.—</p>
         <p>I notice what you say <hi rend="italic">re</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Te Kooti </hi>&amp; Py. Bay folks: I would you had <hi rend="italic">read</hi> my tract on Kereopa (Fiat Justitia:) Py. Bay folks have to thank themselves and their murderous <hi rend="italic">mercenaries </hi>for <hi rend="italic">that calamity</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I am writing to <hi rend="italic">our </hi>members at Wgn. <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Lex. Surely <hi rend="italic">now </hi>something proper should be done,—more anon.  </p>
         <p>W.C.</p>
