         <p rend="end">Napier June 5/82</p>
         <p>My dr. Capt. Russell</p>
         <p>As I wish to keep you fully infd. of every move made <hi rend="italic">re</hi> those spn. ps. Mao. Lexn in wh. you have so kindly &amp; strenuously intd. yrself—I write now to tell you that on Saty nt. (3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. inst.) I recd. a big packet fm. the Nat. Office, contg. 12 pages spn. printed (large Gazette size) of the Mao. Lexn. &amp; all the Ms. copy thereto belonging—with a letter reqg. me to correct the proof sheets &amp; return at once.</p>
         <p>You may guess my surprise! for I had (again) given it up. Howr. yesty. I set to <hi rend="italic">w. a will</hi>, &amp; by dint of workg. have got all over by 8 p.m. When I sent them to P.O.—togr. w. a short Letter to the Under Secy, &amp; a letter to Mr Rolleston—to go by this mgs. overland mail.—</p>
         <p>What was sent to me was just <hi rend="sup ">4</hi>/<hi rend="sub">5</hi>
            <hi rend="sup ">ths</hi>. of the whole of the Ms. I had sent to Sir D. for ptg.—and I much fear that the remg. <hi rend="sup ">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">5</hi>
            <hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. or so will not be added thereto. Hence I took on myself to write to Mr. R.—(<hi rend="italic">not offy.</hi>) callg. his attention to it, &amp; asking him to aid in the matter—showing him the necessity of the thing, in order to give a tolerably fair sample of the said work. And now I want <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—to write a line to him, (or to any one else you may know there who wod. take the trouble <hi rend="italic">quietly </hi>to move in the matter &amp; that at once) to endr. (<hi rend="italic">if needed</hi>) to get <hi rend="italic">the whole </hi>printed:—it wod. be a gt. pity now that so much has been at last! accomplished to have this small wantg. portion omitted.<note xml:id="ftn3-147" place="foot" n="147"> WC: I should add that I am not sure that it is not intended to print the remg. portion; though I fear not. What was sent to me was the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. lot I had ford. to McL.—who had harried me to do so, in order that the ptg. of it might be commenced, &amp; of course it ends abruptly, the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. (&amp; small) lot I also ford. by the next str.</note> I will fully explain the whole thing to you when we meet—but when will that be?—I have not seen you since the summer!</p>
         <p>I shall write Mr Bryce offy. &amp; briefly by next mail abt. it. </p>
         <p>One of my apologies to Mr. R. for troubling him was,—that “I had neither Capt. R. nor Mr. O. <hi rend="italic">now</hi> at Wgn. to whom I cod. write.”—will the readg. that evoke a smile or a sigh?</p>
