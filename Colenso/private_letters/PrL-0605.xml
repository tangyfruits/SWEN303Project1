         <p rend="end">Napier, August 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, 1885.</p>
         <p>My dear Dr. Von Haast</p>
         <p>I fear you are much too busy to read private notes, much less to answer them! but I will try to be brief.—</p>
         <p>It was only yesterday that I saw Dobson in town, who told me of you &amp; of your now being returned to Xt.Ch.—</p>
         <p>I was exceedingly vexed with myself (more than words can express), to find, that I did not see you when <hi rend="italic">last</hi> here! And I, too, here in town!! But I was <hi rend="italic">very</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">unwell</hi> indeed at that time, and for 2–3 weeks after.</p>
         <p>I was inland in the Bush when I <hi rend="italic">heard </hi>of your coming overland to Napier. You reached this place on Thursday night, and I followed in your track (in rain) only on Friday morning. I had taken a cold 2–3 days before, and when I arrived here—<hi rend="italic">I was done for</hi>! Severe attack of Bronchitis—lost my voice, &amp;c. Still, I did not suppose you would be leaving us so early—for, though I could not go out of doors, I partly expected to see you here: and then, afterwards, I hoped you would return <hi rend="italic">by this way</hi>. However, it has so happened, and I regret it.</p>
         <p>Your kind note of June 9<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. I received shortly before I went to the woods. I went thither <hi rend="italic">in the winter season</hi> to get some <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ </hi>in <hi rend="italic">fruit</hi>, with other small Crypts. While there I was suddenly seized with Lumbago! (Do you know it?) which floored me for nearly a fortnight: hence, too, I was so greatly delayed.—</p>
         <p>In your note you say, for me to send on my (few) Moa bones to you to be named: I thank you for this—but, <hi rend="italic">May I do so now</hi>? And <hi rend="italic">to Xt.Ch.</hi>? or, are you too busy?—A <hi rend="italic">single word</hi> by wire will do.</p>
         <p>Then you ask for the Bronze Bell to take to your Exhibition.—Would not a <hi rend="italic">cast </hi>serve? Dr. H. got several made, &amp; he sent us one here. I mention this, as Dr. H. positively refused to run the risk of taking the Bell to the Melbourne Exhibition, saying— “it ought not to go out of the Colony.”—</p>
         <p>You have also sent me some of your Exhibition “forms” for exhibits,—as if <hi rend="italic">I </hi>had anything here worth sending to such a great show! Had I seen you here I could have submitted 2–3 things to your superior judgement; but, in my own opinion, I have nothing worthy,—save (as you say) the Bronze Bell:—and, possibly, a new copy of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Editn. Maori New Test., in 8vo., printed by myself at Paihia, Bay of Islands, in 1837,—and, also, a copy of the Prayer Book Ch. of England, also printed by me there in 1840 (and both, also, bound in leather by me). Would you like a copy of “specimen sheets” of the Maori Lexicon, (containing only 20 folio pages) printed at the Govt. press? Seeing that <hi rend="italic">I have to go on with it</hi>!! Your Countryman Max Müller had a copy from me, &amp; wrote me a handsome letter in reply.</p>
         <p>I suppose you have <hi rend="italic">seen </hi>Locke, and perhaps given him the “Annals” containing Quatrefage’s papers.—</p>
         <p>Believe me, yours faithfully</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Dobson did not know of my having returned: nor did anyone else here for a fortnight. W.C.</p>
