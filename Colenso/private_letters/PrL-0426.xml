         <p>Mr John Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir </p>
         <p>Your note of the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> I received last night, and as it requires an early answer I write at once; for you will be much too busy next week, the mail after this, to look at letters.</p>
         <p>First, I am pleased to find that you are <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">well</hi> and that your good old Mother was with you. I had thought (when I last wrote) or rather hoped, as much—for your sakes, knowing the great benefit arising to you all.</p>
         <p>Second, I am also pleased to find you so well and so fully employed; (although you have only told me a <hi rend="italic">part</hi>;—a “Waipawa Mail” which I happened to see at the Athenæum, told me the rest, and right glad was I, to find that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had headed the shooters at Hampden. I hope that Jones and yourself may win; I shall look out for your getting Heslop’s prize,—and if you do so, I shall supplement it.</p>
         <p>I <hi rend="italic">did not </hi>“think you careless” in your not writing to me, very far from it; for I well knew you had plenty to chain your time.</p>
         <p>As to your expressed wish about naming your son, <hi rend="italic">Do as you have said </hi>(seeing yourself and your good wife <hi rend="italic">both </hi>wish it)—You have my most ready consent, and very best wishes, and prayers for <hi rend="italic">his </hi>and your success.—</p>
         <p>I write but a short note to you this time,—but hope to write you a longer one after the show.</p>
         <p>And with kind regards to all—including Mother if still with you. I am</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso.</p>
