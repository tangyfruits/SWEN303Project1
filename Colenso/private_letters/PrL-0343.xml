         <p>S. Locke, Esq</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I hope you are getting reconciled to your situation.</p>
         <p>Last Thursday mg. I sought you: but lo! the bird was flown! (I had been looking for you a day or two before, but I heard you were busy.) Had I seen you, I should not now be troubling you with this.—</p>
         <p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. I wrote to Dr. Hector—&amp; among other things, I said, that Weber, Locke, Spencer, John White &amp; others (<hi rend="italic">Members</hi>) had been speaking to me about getting the “<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>” (to the old essay on the Maoris) printed in the “Transactions”, &amp; asking Dr. H., If he would agree to it on my <hi rend="italic">again</hi> re-writing them—for the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. time:—I have had no reply to this, but if you should have the opportunity, speak to him about it.—Dr. H. <hi rend="italic">has</hi> acknowledged receipt of my <hi rend="italic">2</hi> papers (read here 3 weeks back), &amp; said, that Dr. <hi rend="italic">B</hi>. had given him a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> account of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> meeting.</p>
         <p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. I wished to speak with you, about the loss of <hi rend="italic">all our Library </hi>Books in the “Q. Bee”! (and several others of my own, which I wanted, &amp; which I regret,)—but I have, since, telegraphed to the Agents at Nelson,—&amp; I find there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> chance.</p>
         <p>3. About Gannon.—I enclose a note, which please, either <hi rend="italic">give</hi> to, or <hi rend="italic">post</hi> for him. He received the vol. for ’76, &amp; Report &amp;c of the other day, &amp; <hi rend="italic">should</hi> pay his subsn.:—but if he <hi rend="italic">will not</hi>, then he should not be allowed to “loaf” at Wgn., as<hi rend="italic"> a Member</hi> of our corps, &amp; so get admission <hi rend="italic">free</hi> to the Wgn. meetings. He could have spoken to me (when here), or written to me, if he wished to <hi rend="italic">cease</hi> being a member.</p>
         <p>You will not have time to write to me, I know; but send me a <hi rend="italic">paper</hi>, now &amp; then, <hi rend="italic">if any thing </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">good</hi>—especially of your <hi rend="italic">Libel case</hi>.</p>
         <p>“Manaia” left last night leaving me—who was waiting—behind!! Atward &amp; Carroll told me yesterday, they should not go until <hi rend="italic">this</hi> night!</p>
         <p>Should you <hi rend="italic">see</hi> Lyon—give my best. Kindest regards.—</p>
         <p>     I am Dr Sir Yours truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
