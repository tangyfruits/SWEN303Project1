         <p rend="end">Napier, Jany 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1897.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir James Hector,</p>
         <p>I have this day handed over to our Branch Institute Hony. Secy. my presidential “Address” of May last,—to be forwarded to you. Hitherto I had demurred to do so, but owing to the pressing request of several of our Members I have given way—as they wish to preserve if possible some of the <hi rend="italic">last words </hi>of the writer.—</p>
         <p>And my only reason for troubling you with this note, is to say, that, If the same cannot be published in its entirety, please do not make an abstract of it, but return it—in due course.</p>
         <p>I have no other <hi rend="italic">Paper </hi>(proper) this last Session, save a small one on a few Ferns.</p>
         <p>I may also now mention a paper of 1895,—“Reminiscences, &amp;c, of the Tin Mines of Cornwall,”—which was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> published: <hi rend="italic">this I shall request our Secy. to ask you to return, there being here among us </hi>(and <hi rend="italic">at Woodville District</hi>) a large number of Cornishmen settled, who greatly wish to have it published, which I shall propose to do by Subscn. Anything of that kind is to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>—as a sprig of Heather &amp;c., to my Northern friends.—</p>
         <p>Hope you are quite well, and (tho’ <hi rend="italic">late</hi>) wishing you “a Happy New Year”,</p>
         <p> I am, Yours faithy, W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
