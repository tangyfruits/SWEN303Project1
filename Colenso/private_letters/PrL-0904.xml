         <p>Mr. Hans Mortensen,<lb/>Norsewood.</p>
         <p>My dear Hans,</p>
         <p>I have received your kind loving letter of the 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. and thank you much for it. I have been thinking on you and your family there very often, because I have so much here, in dried plants, mosses &amp; ferns, gathered in your woods, in happy hours long passed away! that serve <hi rend="italic">to remind me of them, and of</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>—<hi rend="underline italic">all</hi>. I was pleased to hear of your being well in health, save your mother-in-law, and I hope that she is now better, and with returning spring season, now coming on and near, will soon be well again. I was glad to know that your father-in-law was well—give my kind remembrances to him. From your letter I found that Charley Clemett had <hi rend="italic">not </hi>then returned to his father’s house, I had written a letter to him, expecting he had gone Home, but I dare say he is now with you: I hope his removal will not be the means of keeping him back from recovery.—</p>
         <p>Three days ago I got a letter from Mr. Eccles, at Woodville, informing me of his being laid-up and very bad from Influenza, and asking me to go thither, and take the Church duty for 2 Sundays, and this I have agreed to do, so I purpose leaving here next Friday, but it will be too soon for me to think of visiting you:—besides, I do not intend to remain there any longer than I can be of service—having plenty to do here.—</p>
         <p>Of late, our weather has been very fine, I have heard of more wet in the country;—and I have been keeping very well, with only a <hi rend="underline italic">little</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> reminder </hi>every day of Rheumatism, which I can very well bear, although I have <hi rend="underline italic">no</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">love</hi> for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>!—Several here have died from Influenza, and among them Scully, whom you must have well known in days gone by.</p>
         <p>You mention the black <hi rend="italic">Maire </hi>wood, and my bringing some away with me, from your dear Father, to the Railway Station here; yes, I went there and saw the Manager, about it, but though he spoke well of it, I could not get him to use it; I am pleased in hearing from you, that, at last! some use is made of it.—</p>
         <p>This morning, in Church here I had to read Romans 10 chapter, a favourite one with me, as it contains <hi rend="italic">glorious and holy truths in plain language affecting </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">us</hi>: I don’t know, dear Hans, whether you use an English or a Norse Bible, but do you read that chapter.</p>
         <p>And now I must close:—and with very kind regards, and best wishes, believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>The little booklet is for your <hi rend="italic">eldest.</hi>
