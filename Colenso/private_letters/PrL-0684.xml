         <p rend="end">NAPIER TUESDAY NIGHT <lb/>Sept 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1888</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour<lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I suppose you have been on the lookout for a reply to your letter on trout ova &amp; their enemies, of Aug 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.—which was duly received by me. I could not well reply last week, it being S.F. Mail week, and I extra busy getting out last pages of “Jub. Paper”—or rather its long appendix, with three plates!!!—besides, as I could make nothing worth writing about from the “Mud” you sent me—I passed on a portion of it to Dr Spencer for him to examine with his powerful Compound Microscope—and, I find, from him the result to be the same. Moreover, I had reserved your letter (part of it) for our meeting last night—and you will find a tolerably fair report in our papers—all three!!!—they seem to be waking up a bit—after my showing them up.</p>
         <p>Neither Dr S nor myself could find any trace of <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi> in the “mud”—such was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> likely, but Diatoms, dead, &amp;c,—.</p>
         <p>There is a disease well known at home that attacks &amp; destroys Ova in that way, thro Fungi adhering to their gills. If you have any more such, put a Sp or two of the fish into spirits, and send them on.</p>
         <p>I hope you and yours are all well. I am so. I cannot write a long letter this time, I am sadly <hi rend="italic">behind.</hi> With kind regards</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I did hope to get away to Bush <hi rend="italic">this week</hi>, but cannot. Hope to do so next week.</p>
