         <p rend="end">Baddeley’s Hotel<lb/>Dannevirke<lb/>Decr. 3/88</p>
         <p>Mr. A. Luff,<lb/>  Wellington.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>At last! we <hi rend="italic">here</hi> have a blue sky &amp; sun shining &amp; little wind, today, but whether such is to <hi rend="italic">continue </hi>I dare not say.—I have been here (on this occasion) 10 days, and the weather has been most unseasonable: wet (showery), <hi rend="underline italic">stormy</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">winds</hi>, almost always from SW. &amp; SSW., &amp; <hi rend="italic">very cold</hi>: I have not yet ventured into the neighbouring “Bush”, but having had plenty of writing to do—particularly for last week’s S.F. Mail (not having been able to write Home for the 2 former Mails) I have not so greatly cared at my being a kind of prisoner—besides I <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> that my old bush legs &amp; <hi rend="italic">knees</hi> are failing me <hi rend="italic">fast</hi>!</p>
         <p>I dare say you have been on the look-out for a line from me, &amp; I should have written to you before had the weather been different—even now, I am pretty sure it will rain again today. From the papers I find the folks at Napier &amp; Neighbourhood have been also experiencing a little of our cold &amp; wet, &amp;c.—though before I left N. it was fine &amp; <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> there, &amp; strawberries in great plenty in shops—here, <hi rend="italic">none</hi>!—–</p>
         <p>This week, too, is a busy one in these parts (so they say) <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Waipawa Exhibn.—which opens on 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., &amp; single daily fares continuing until 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., I am <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> to visit it, on some day (or 2, as I shall sleep there) but cannot now say when. (I fear it will prove to be a losing spec., &amp; one, I have thought, that had better not have been begun). <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, too, the Sc. Ch. folks—are <hi rend="italic">busy</hi> for their sacred Concert of Song, Tea meeting, &amp;c., at which I have promised their Minister to take the chair. He was here yesty. &amp; preached an excellent Sermon last night; &amp; then after IX. <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to return to his home at Woodville, his wife &amp; family laid up w. <hi rend="italic">scarlatina</hi>: I have also engaged to take duty (Div. S.) next Sunday evg. in their Ch. (as he can only come on alternate Sundays), this I have done before.—I do not exactly know when I shall return to N.—I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> return the week <hi rend="italic">after next</hi>, &amp; so take my visit to W. Ex. in my way—or, I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> not return till <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of year—I prefer being here, only missing my Books: <hi rend="italic">here </hi>I am much more comfortable; hear <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> words, see smiling countenances, have my <hi rend="italic">little </hi>(&amp; <hi rend="italic">few</hi>) wants attended to without murmurs, &amp; so enjoy better health—on the whole.–I have had however, plenty of Rheumatism—both there &amp; here; of course I never expect to be free from it.</p>
         <p>I suppose <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, too, well knowing all the parties, have been interested in the <hi rend="italic">Will case</hi>: I rejoiced over the judgment of the Ct. of App., &amp; have read w. pleasure the reasonable remarks in Wgn. “Evg. Press” thereon (copied by R.P. into his “D.T.”) and, as I have often said,—would that S.W. had had <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to do with it.—–</p>
         <p>I now hasten w. this to P.O.—</p>
         <p>With very kind regards, &amp; hoping you &amp; yours are all quite well.</p>
         <p>I am, my dr. Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours truly                          W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Should you see Mr. Grubb, remember me kindly to him, &amp; tell him I will write.</p>
