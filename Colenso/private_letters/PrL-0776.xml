         <p rend="end">Napier, April 9, 1891</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Here am I thinking <hi rend="italic">on you</hi>, and on the extra trouble, I fear, I may have caused you by my last letter; that, too, will have surprised you. And now for <hi rend="italic">another</hi> surprise! Actually a copy of the Dy. <hi rend="italic">from</hi> T., with a letter from him enclosed!!! And <hi rend="italic">overlooked</hi> among the multitude of parcels, &amp;c &amp;c—I enclose his letter, &amp; a copy of mine to him—that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may know all about it—please return both. I <hi rend="underline italic">feel</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> much more</hi> than I have cared to say.</p>
         <p>In town this mg. Mr Jago was very anxious to know <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the missing vol.—I sd. I had written to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, &amp;c.—I hope it <hi rend="italic">is easily remedied</hi>.—I called on Crerar, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> “Torch”: he has no copies left: he said, he had told me of it (?) &amp; I had replied, “I had no time to spare”. Perhaps so: but he never explained it—when I return from <hi rend="italic">inland</hi>, I am to see his bound former parts.—</p>
         <p>This day is again <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>, and I am beginning to <hi rend="italic">feel better</hi>. I saw Mr Sidey in town this mg. who was very well &amp; ditto Craig, Fannin, &amp; Large. Drennan—I think—you must have known, i.e. <hi rend="italic">his appearance</hi>, he wore mustachios like <hi rend="italic">skewers</hi>, a-la-L.Napoleon!</p>
         <p>I note what you say, in your last kind letter of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Carpenter’s Books: how I should like to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> them!—and, I wish you to purchase that big Herbal, and the Barbadoes book, up to £1. ea. or (say) £2. for both; I fear I may not get a Cat. in time. I have not got any reply from Col. Secy.—no doubt, holidays cause delay.</p>
         <p>Of course you will conclude that I have not yet looked into Ts’. Dy.—<hi rend="italic">no time</hi>, at <hi rend="italic">present</hi>, as I have much to do before I leave on Saty. mg.—</p>
         <p>On Tuesday <hi rend="italic">night</hi> another <hi rend="italic">batch</hi> of proof sheets from N.Z.I. Wgn. (sent by—“Bothamley”—or some such n.—I wish everyone would, <hi rend="italic">at least</hi>, write their <hi rend="italic">name distinctly</hi>:) I returned it yesterday. I was surprised to see it—as I never supposed it could pass <hi rend="italic">the ordeal:—</hi>it was merely some “Bush Jottings,” written to please our <hi rend="italic">final</hi> meeting, and to save me from—imputations!! The Proof sheets were <hi rend="italic">very well</hi> done, clean: but spacing (in some lines) <hi rend="italic">not</hi> A.1.—</p>
         <p>I sent Dawson, “3 Lity. P.,” with a list of <hi rend="italic">others</hi> (requested) that Craig has, and in ansg. his letter, pretty fully, have told him, I <hi rend="italic">cannot continue</hi> to correspond, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Friday, 10</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>,<hi rend="italic">night. </hi>I now conclude my letter. This day has been a glorious long one of our “Indn. Summer” series: may many such follow! At noon I recd. the Liby. copy, of Dy, from L. &amp; B. (<hi rend="italic">thanks</hi>, to you,) but without a line. I hope you had no <hi rend="italic">great</hi> diffy. My letter to T. was posted this mg.—I look to you to give me <hi rend="italic">your fair opinion of it</hi>—but, there, <hi rend="italic">you don’t know his former letters</hi>. I have been packing all day (for taking, &amp; for leaving) if I were <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> of going on to Dvk. &amp; staying there I would take Ts. Dy. with me. Much pleased this aftn. w. a “wire” from Scrimgeour, that he had <hi rend="italic">2 rooms</hi> for me. In your writing—<hi rend="italic">before</hi> you again hear from me—add. to N. All letters, &amp;c, will be left <hi rend="italic">here</hi> until I direct otherwise. The Blue Gums here played similar havoc w. walls of my underground tanks. Goodbye: hope this may find you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> 5 well &amp; <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>.</p>
         <p>Yours faithy. W.Colenso.</p>
         <p>Thanks for Opotiki &amp; other papers recd.: no doubt the Judge <hi rend="italic">saw more</hi> than the Jury did!—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Be sure to let me know</hi>, if you have a copy of my <hi rend="italic">Essay on Maoris</hi> in Vol I. Trans.</p>
