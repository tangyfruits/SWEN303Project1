         <p rend="end">Napier, Saturday.<lb/>Noon, Septr. 22, 1888.</p>
         <p>W. Luff Esq.,</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your note of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. (which I was glad to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>!) I received yesterday, &amp; should have replied at once—only there was something in it I could not understand—at least, not without inquiry:—<hi rend="italic">Viz</hi>., your “ackng. receipt of my Jubilee pamphlet”.—I knew I had not sent you one, as, according to arrangement (it being a <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> Society’s <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Board’s Paper) the issue of it to subscribers rested with Secretary Hamilton: I wrote to him last evg. to enq. and now his ansr. is to hand—he never sent <hi rend="italic">you</hi> any. So, I am driven to suppose you must (somehow) mean my “Address” to H.B. Ph. Institute, given in June last, of which, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> published, I did send you—&amp; all our members—a copy.</p>
         <p>The “Jubilee Paper” is a very different one; it was only published on Saturday last, 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst.—I enclose a circular respecting it—also an advertisement from <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, (I thought you took in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> paper)—the circular <hi rend="italic">you should have received</hi> when issued—as a Member,—and Hamilton, I fancy, posted you a copy, as he had instructions to <hi rend="italic">send to all</hi>.</p>
         <p>Craig is writing to Lyon &amp; B.—re sending them a few copies on sale, the “Evg. Post” does (<hi rend="underline italic">barely</hi>!) acknowledge copy sent—but I am <hi rend="italic">no</hi> subscriber.</p>
         <p>To your question— “When I revisit the Bush?” I reply, about middle of October—say, <hi rend="italic">last</hi> week in October and <hi rend="italic">first</hi> in November, will be pretty sure to <hi rend="italic">find me there</hi>, if alive &amp; well.——–</p>
         <p>I was to have been there (at Dannevirke) this week, but various matters, combined, hindered me, for, as President &amp; <hi rend="italic">general</hi> servant of our Society, I have to keep a good look-out to serve fairly during my term of office;—and so, had I gone thither I could only stay a week or so (rain or shine), and I greatly dislike Railway travelling—owing to the draughts.—–</p>
         <p>Should you come on to this (or that) direction—you could advantageously do as Grubb <hi rend="italic">did</hi> (to save time &amp;c.) from Woodville <hi rend="italic">early</hi>, &amp; after a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> day at D.—back thither at night 8.30 train.—but I could net <hi rend="underline italic">well</hi> go to Woodville from D., train leaving at 12.30 and returning at 3.30.</p>
         <p>I have had a full share of troubles here lately—which still exist! &amp; some of them serve to remind me of you—and long past days.</p>
         <p>I fear I shall soon have to sell a portion of this hill property.—I have been repeatedly asked to do so: only <hi rend="italic">1</hi> horse in house paddocks now (Rev. D. Sidey’s) instead of 4, N. &amp; Close give up their <hi rend="italic">big</hi> paddock end of this month—&amp; rates &amp;c. increasing! Have just accepted a tender to fill in corner Sn. No. 316 for £100 (being the <hi rend="italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">nd</hi>. £100) better I had years ago done as Weber did w. his swamp Sn.—<hi rend="italic">give it up.</hi>—–Money also <hi rend="italic">is hard</hi> to get in: have reduced rates of int. to 7% (I paying Propy. Tax) &amp; yet, difficult to get any.</p>
         <p>Hope you are keeping well. Why write “<hi rend="italic">in haste</hi>”? your once-in-2-years note! I am keeping fairly well: fine winter here, and <hi rend="italic">fine weather</hi> every day of late,</p>
         <p>With kind regards, Yrs. truly</p>
         <p>                                                     W. Colenso.</p>
