         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>I think I will write to you this night, as my hand that has been stiff &amp; awkward all day, is now more pliable—but this day has been a trying one to me, w. Infl. pains <hi rend="italic">in feet</hi>—I went to town this mg. (first time for this week) &amp; was taken while there with those pains, &amp; returned w. diffy. Yours of 29<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. ulto. I have recd. &amp; I thank you for it, &amp; espy. for 2 good items in it, 1. Your son Victor “<hi rend="italic">improving</hi>”: 2. Your job in ptg. line, which you were <hi rend="italic">expecting</hi>—hope you got it—&amp; more besides.—</p>
         <p>Last Sunday I was at Taradale for Tuke, who is still ailing from Influenza: took the 2 S. <hi rend="italic">there</hi>: T. at Meeanee, &amp; at Puketapu. On Wednesday 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi> I went to Waipawa, retg. on Thursday evg. While halting at Hastings, Rev. J. Hobbs came into carriage &amp; gave me the enclosed leaflet <hi rend="underline italic">printed there</hi>! I should mention that Rev. Theod. Dowling was a passgr. from Wgn. in train w. me, and we sat together, &amp; chatted to station N. the Dean coming thither to meet him: I was much too tired, &amp; w. pains in feet, so that I could not go down to their Meeting. Among my Papers, &amp;c, from Engd. were 2 big nos. of “The Effective Publg. Co.” Serial for Decr., but addd. (1) “Ed. Waka Maori”: and (1) “Ed Wananga” also, on each, “c/o Rev. W.C.”—so I have opened one, &amp; am <hi rend="italic">astonished at much that is in it, re </hi>ptg. machines, <hi rend="underline italic">&amp;c, &amp;c</hi>. I suppose you have a copy, of course, but if not I will gladly send on one of these. How came the Co. to address to “Wananga” &amp; to “W. Maori”—so <hi rend="italic">long ago </hi>dead!! I also send you a <hi rend="italic">peculiar </hi>notice of a new “Manual”—something <hi rend="underline italic">new</hi>, even for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>! <hi rend="underline italic">in the type way</hi>: what next? it came in a lot (catalogues pubs. &amp;c) from Oxford.</p>
         <p>In town, <hi rend="italic">last </hi>week, I saw Large, &amp; in talking w. him <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the Annl. Meeting—he informed me, that G. White would no longer act as Hony. Secy. (from want of time)—&amp; then L. went on to say—he &amp; they were desirous that I should undertake that duty! &amp; he pressed it again &amp; again!! so, I suppose, they have made up their minds as to the other offices. However, I quietly told L. there was <hi rend="italic">not the slightest hope </hi>for them in this matter.—Mrs. Fannin is gone to her Home down S., &amp; F. is going to leave his house &amp; <hi rend="italic">let </hi>it (he has already done <hi rend="italic">this</hi>): Mrs Margoliouth was a passgr. on Wednesday, w. 3 of her yg. ones!!going to place them at school in Whanganui. I note (w. grief!) your clipping sent, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the Romeward move of <hi rend="italic">many</hi> in Ch. of E.! I dare believe the reaction <hi rend="italic">will come</hi>. As for me I set my face like a flint against all &amp; <hi rend="italic">everything of the kind</hi>—even to the preaching <hi rend="italic">against all such</hi>: &amp; <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, I know <hi rend="italic">has been used against me</hi>!—</p>
         <p>I notice B.B. Johnson stating, at Creditors’ meeting yesty., that he had been driven to file through <hi rend="italic">J. Harding </hi>issuing a writ agt. him, for goods &amp; book-debts of W.B. Harding (£150. or so) which B.B.J. had purchased:—and I thought, could this be any of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> family? B.B.J. has made a <hi rend="italic">sad</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">mess</hi> of it—and I (or we—all, at Waipawa) said he would.</p>
         <p>I am not a little vexed with that <hi rend="italic">dolt </hi>Haggen (in his <hi rend="italic">precious </hi>“Examiner”!)—publishing a nasty scratchy art. from “Evg. News”, <hi rend="italic">against </hi>Rev. D. Sidey as a m. of the Edn. Bd. Of course what makes it so bad is the fact that <hi rend="italic">H. himself</hi> is seeking election!!—<hi rend="italic">it is almost libellous</hi>. And he keeps <hi rend="italic">on </hi>doing much the same against Symes!—If H. does not be more careful he will be surely trapped again! From a letter to hand I find Robertshawe <hi rend="italic">laid up </hi>w. Influenza remains! no Service: and so, Eccles; &amp; Tuke is scarcely able to carry on. And in a note from my eldest son (in pencil, &amp; in bed,) he too is seriously ill from it; his daughter, removed from the house by Dr’s. order, had been kindly taken in by the Vicar of the place: so I have plenty of sad news.</p>
         <p>I may not write any more, so Good bye, &amp; w. every good wish believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely, W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. If you are writing that way—order for me 1 copy “Effective News” I will become a subscriber &amp; will send you subsn.—together w. that for “Typo” next letter.</p>
