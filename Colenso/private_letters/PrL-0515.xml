         <p rend="end">Napier, October 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1882.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Three months ago this day I wrote to you, requesting 5 additional copies of vol. XIV. “Transactions”, for our then newly-elected members, (<hi rend="italic">offering to pay for them if required</hi>,) and again at the end of August I wrote to Mr. Gore on the same subject, thinking you were absent:—but <hi rend="italic">no answer has reached me</hi>.</p>
         <p>Since then we have elected several more members, who also want this last vol. if to be had: I have told them all, that I should write to you, for copies; and they are waiting.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Please let me have an answer for them.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Members of our Council have lately told me, that others would join us at once, if they could be sure of having a copy each of vol. XIV.</p>
         <p>Enclosed I send a cutting from our local paper, containing a <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> of our meeting last Monday.</p>
         <p>I trust you will see the propriety and necessity of getting some of those innovations stopped,—referred to in my paper on “Nomenclature” (2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. part), especially <hi rend="italic">the non-using of Capitals for all species named after persons</hi>, &amp;c;—at all events, <hi rend="italic">in my own papers</hi> if to be published.</p>
         <p>I send you separately in a small box, a pretty little species of <hi rend="italic">Procellaria</hi> which seems new to me; I cannot reconcile it with any of those mentioned (scarcely “described”) by Buller. I received it alive from <hi rend="italic">inland</hi>, and kept it 2 days under a wire dish-cover, where it injured its beak <hi rend="italic">at night </hi>through incessantly probing the wires. If this little Petrel should prove to be a <hi rend="italic">sp. nov</hi>., I will give you a bit of its history: please tell me something about it.—</p>
         <p>I suppose that owing to the death of Dr. Darwin a vacancy has occurred in the number of Honorary Members, and we shyall have to elect some one thereto next month: <hi rend="italic">please advise me</hi>.</p>
         <p>     I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>             Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>                     Wm. Colenso,</p>
         <p>                             Hony. Secy.,</p>
         <p>                             H. B. Ph. Inst.</p>
