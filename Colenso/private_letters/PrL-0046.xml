         <p>Ki a te Mea</p>

         <p> (Beginning of letter missing)</p>
         <p>... of tomorrow; make what provision Christian prudence dictates, for the future, and <hi rend="italic">leave events with God</hi>. His are the gold and the silver and the fulness of the world, and he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> give, through a 1000 ways, whensoever he pleases. As the psalmist says— “’Tis when they are diminished and brought low through oppression affliction and sorrow, that he setteth the poor on high after affliction, and maketh his families like a flock”;—as we see in the case of Job, who had more in the end, than he had in the beginning. God, too, has the hearts of all men in his hand, and he turneth them as He pleases—Look to Him, then, my dear friend—tell him <hi rend="italic">all</hi> your griefs:—your debts, your losses, your incumbrances, your fears—make Him your friend, (like Hezekiah in his trouble, Isaiah <hi rend="smallcaps">xxxvii</hi>, particularly the 14 verse,)—tell Him <hi rend="italic">all</hi> (and <hi rend="italic">more</hi>) than you would tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and sure I am that our Heavenly Father, who <hi rend="italic">waits</hi>, will graciously direct you; and by thus dealing with him, you make him the friend of your children—who will want a friend when you are gone.</p>
         <p>I could say much more, but I will stop—only hoping that you will not be offended at my freedom and faithfulness which, I trust, arises from my regard for your welfare,</p>
         <p rend="end">Monday Morning, April 15th. (1844) </p>
         <p>As Stephen and his party are about returning I must hasten to finish my Letter. I have little however of news to communicate. I have heard of Capt. L’s being up from Ngunguru, but I have not seen him. The Columbine has not yet arrived although we hear by the Thomas Lord that she is outside. Parata is coming over-land (so we hear)—and his new house is not burnt down as reported. Mr. Davis is gone to Kaitaia, and Mr. Puckey and Mr. Matthews are expected here daily. Stephen cannot make the Bishop alter his plan respecting me, although they have had a long korero. The Bishop told me last week, that he should send me down to visit Wangarei and neighbourhood in about 2 months—and that he himself should go there in about 4 months. When I know the time I will endeavour to let you know,—it will be somewhat grievous to me to have to go, as it will be the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>! (this word sounds awfully dismal in my ears.) But we look forward to a meeting under <hi rend="italic">happier circumstances</hi>, and where parting will be <hi rend="italic">unknown</hi>. Blessed be God for this hope! May we use all diligence to make our calling and election <hi rend="italic">sure</hi>! From a letter just received, I learn that Capt. Ross is preparing for another expedition to the North Pole by way of Spitzbergen. There is an English whaler now in the Bay, refitting for voyage home.—Such an event nowadays, reminds us of old times.</p>
         <p>I am happy to say our little girl is pretty well—and growing fast—she is not yet baptized, as we wait for Mr. W. Williams and Mrs. Chapman as Godfather and Godmother—we intend calling her Frances Mary. My “<hi rend="italic">missus</hi>” desires her kind love to Mrs. Mair—and I am sure I will not be behind.</p>
         <p>And now my dear friend, good bye, and may God bless you!</p>
         <p>               Prays yours very sincerely</p>
         <p>                                               William Colenso.</p>
