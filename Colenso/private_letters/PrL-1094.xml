      <p> 
During the last six months I have been employed as follows.</p>
<p>When at Paihia, in reading and correcting proof sheets of Archdeacon Williams’ Dictionary, Mixing and dispensing medicines to Natives, conversing with them &amp;c. &amp;c. On Sundays I have as usual visited the natives at the different villages.</p>
<p>On the 5th. of January I left Paihia for the Thames and returned on the 27th. of that month. On the 27th. March I left Paihia on a visit to the natives living on the shores of Wangarei Bay and returned on the 8th. April.</p>
<p>On the 17th. I left Paihia again for the Thames where I was married and on the 7th. May returned to Paihia with Mrs. Colenso.</p>
<p>On the 12th. of this month (June) I left Paihia to reside as a student and candidate for Holy Orders at St. John’s College, Waimate, where I am now studying under the direction of his lordship the Bishop of New Zealand. On the 1st. Jan. 1843 I delivered up the charge of the Printing Office and Printing Stores to Mr. Telford as desired by the N. District Committee.</p>
