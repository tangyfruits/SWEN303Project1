         <p rend="end">Napier, Sunday night,<lb/>Septr. 23<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. 1894</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Your long &amp; intg. letter of 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> &amp; 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. w. papers (3) &amp; spns. from your own press, came to hand yesty., and I thank you for your letter, but <hi rend="italic">not </hi>for these 3 Papers! Why? because they contain (as far as I can see) <hi rend="italic">nothing </hi>of int. to me!! &amp;, <hi rend="italic">worse still</hi>, are the cause of gt. disappt. Several days ago I had heard from Hill <hi rend="italic">re </hi>2 letters in yr. Wgn. papers, which put me on the tiptoe of expectancy—for H. (who had seen them in Athenm.) had sd.— “Hdg. will be sure to send them!” and lo! they are <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. One </hi>letter being Howlett’s <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Tregear, &amp;c., w. profn. Sayce’s <hi rend="italic">dictum</hi> (which I have long been expg.)—and <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, Hill’s own. Indeed I had written to Librarian at Athenm., but (tho’ I <hi rend="underline italic">don’t trouble</hi> her, &amp; regly. pay my subsn.) to no avail: I would have hunted them up myself, were <hi rend="italic">her hours more suitable </hi>for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>—I always return at xii—pretty well tired.—–</p>
         <p>Very likely W.W.C’s. Edl. effusions in them may be good—but (1) I care nothing for that subject, and (2) I never read <hi rend="italic">his dry </hi>&amp; wire drawn long writings—those in Trans. N.Z. I., I “skip”—not at all in my way.</p>
         <p>Your <hi rend="italic">usual </hi>graphic account of your Phil. Mtg. is, again, <hi rend="italic">good</hi>—I have enjoyed that, only I would that Maskell had “met with his match” in the <hi rend="italic">Deluge </hi>matter. Did you (<hi rend="italic">at the time</hi>) note, what you kindly read in my paper, there—<hi rend="italic">re </hi>M. &amp; <hi rend="italic">his </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">belg</hi>. <hi rend="italic">traditions</hi>?—European of course!</p>
         <p>As usual w. me: I have had plenty to do in the wtg. way: some one, Auckland, sent me a copy “N.Z. Herald”, contg. an unpleasant &amp; untruthful statement <hi rend="italic">re </hi>W.C. &amp; Mao. Lexn. &amp; I have written to the speaker—T. Peacock, &amp; shall send <hi rend="italic">you </hi>the copy of my letter, also, the sd. “N.Z. H.”, but please <hi rend="underline italic">return both</hi>—Hill is very much vexed at it; he also tells me—that he had seen in an Auckld. P., extracts from my von Haast’s paper, w. review of same; I have also <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> to get this from Athenæum but without success.——</p>
         <p>We had another pretty <hi rend="italic">long &amp; thick fog</hi> last week, w. changeable &amp; wet weather,—this mg. <hi rend="italic">very fine</hi>—aftn. &amp; evg. rain. The “<hi rend="italic">clans</hi>”are gathg. to Synod—on 25<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., but what is to be the<hi rend="italic"> result</hi>? I am thinking of taking my Synodal flight—to the wilderness. You <hi rend="italic">amuse me</hi> in saying, Pape is a <hi rend="underline italic">Cornishman</hi> (&amp; then, like your friend Tregear finding <hi rend="italic">his </hi>name to be a Cornish one!) Pape is a Hanoverian: his <hi rend="italic">wife </hi>hailed from Cornwall. One item of your budget pleased me much—Victor being <hi rend="italic">so much better</hi>: such a relief also to you &amp; Mrs. Harding: may it long continue &amp; increase!—–</p>
         <p>I have been down in town but<hi rend="italic"> little </hi>of late—I never go save on <hi rend="italic">business</hi>: one curious transformation is the shop—2 doors from Craig’s, &amp; next to Owen’s—become Conroy’s Butcher’s Shop! Lascelles, Senr., is leaving for India, his Liby. was sold by Mont. L. on Friday evg., I wished to get the copy of Hd Bk NZ Flora (nearly new! &amp; uncut, one thick vol.) &amp; had in my Memo. to auctr. mentioned 12/- (this <hi rend="italic">before I saw it</hi>)—but Hill told me it brought 31/- <hi rend="italic">good.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I believe I am in for some of the books (<hi rend="italic">so Hill</hi>), 3 vols. “Trans N.Z. I.”, IX, X, XI, among others, but have not yet heard from auctr. I went on Tuesday (18<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>) to Noa H’s. funeral. I had, the wk. before, arranged to go—and in town on Monday 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> saw Archdn. <hi rend="italic">S</hi>.W. &amp; had a <hi rend="italic">long </hi>talk w. him <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Noa, &amp;c—he also wished me to be there,—the Archdn. read B.S.—I took my <hi rend="italic">Mao</hi>. P.Bk. w. me, &amp; went <hi rend="italic">into </hi>the Ch. with the rest: the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>Mao. S. I have heard for many a yr.! returned without lunching in pouring rain—a <hi rend="underline italic">severe</hi> gale that nt., &amp; all next day: Had, also, to <hi rend="italic">rub noses </hi>w. abt. a score of <hi rend="italic">old </hi>men there. This mg. I went to Augustine’s: there also on last Sy. mg., Clarke, Taradale, offd. Eccles informs me, that tomorrow he brings from Lindauer, Bp. Williams’ portrait. Rev. D. Sidey does not look well, &amp; <hi rend="italic">complains</hi>. Howlett has given Ed. Board a bit of his mind, in a letter to “Herald”, &amp; told Fannin to look-out as he will be a perfect <hi rend="italic">pole-cat</hi> to him!! Gladstone has a theologl. essay (on schism &amp;c, in Ch.) in Augt. no. “XIX Century”—I shall look it up. I write now—as <hi rend="italic">next</hi> wk., S.F. M., &amp; <hi rend="italic">this wk</hi>. Synod <hi rend="italic">folks </hi>will be calling. </p>
         <p>So good bye, with kind regards</p>
         <p>Yours ever                 W. Colenso</p>
         <p>Dr. Branting I <hi rend="italic">knew well</hi>—in Bush: in his old palmy days, &amp; more recently in his low sad ones: I always expected this.———–</p>
