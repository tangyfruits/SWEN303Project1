         <p>Secretaries,<lb/>Ch. Missy. House,<lb/>Salisbury Square, <lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>1.My last letter to you was dated May 24, 1853, which, with 124pp. of Journal then sent, I hope you have safely received.—</p>
         <p>2. I now hasten to despatch another portion of my Journal (112pp.);—which, I confess, you ought to have had long ere this; but my present anomalous and unhappy situation must in some measure plead my excuse.—</p>
         <p>3. Since I last wrote I have been favored with your very kind and truly Christian Letter of August/52, which, with printed circulars &amp; Information respecting the Miss. Chs. Home, I only received in July last. Your loving and cheering Letter—coming as it has at this particular crisis—has affected me deeply; more so, perhaps, than had it been written with a full knowledge on your parts of my present situation. It has acted as a <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> probe to a wounded soul, which had already been ruthlessly &amp; repeatedly searched out with rusty iron. <hi rend="bold">[2]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>4. Unfortunately I cannot now make any reply to your valuable Letter; other, than to thank you for it: I greatly wish I could. Allow me, however, simply to state, (in reference to a subject mentioned in par. 3, of the same,) that my declining to prepare for Priest’s Orders was not owing wholly to the matter which you have subsequently heard of respecting me. I just mention this, lest you should (naturally enough,) be led to infer as much.</p>
         <p>5. On the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of August last I received a Letter from Mr. Vidal, enclosing an extract from the Minutes of the Central Committee, copies of which I now enclose. Mr. Vidal’s Letter, although dated 5 months before, had, evidently, only just been sent from Auckland.</p>
         <p>6. Mrs Colenso left here on the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of August last, on her way to Auckland viâ Te Wairoa; and the latter place on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> instant: taking with her my little child.</p>
         <p>7. During the winter the Rev. S. Williams unexpectedly arrived in this neighbourhood, and remained during great part of August and September. His primary object (I believe) in coming <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>hither—at all events, in <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi>,—was to see the Governor, (who was then daily expected in these parts,) in order to get the piece of Land secured to the Bishop ere the Governor should leave N. Zealand. The Governor, however, never came. During his residence in this place, he called two or three times, but I steadily avoided him; however, on his day of leaving he sent a messenger to me, to say, that he greatly wished to see me; when I (thinking it might be from <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>,) consented to receive him, and we spent several hours together. He told me, that he desired to tell me (among other matters) how sorry he now was that he should have said some harsh things concerning me to the Natives of this place on his former visit—such as,—that his father was always opposed to my being ordained, from my being an unfit person, &amp;c. I dealt very plainly with him, telling him, that it mattered very little to me what he, or any one should say, that I only wished both him and the Bishop (and in fact, all) so to deal with me as they would answer for it before <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, and as would give them no burthen of Conscience in <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>a dying hour. While he was staying in this neighbourhood the Rev. J Hamlin also arrived, but we did not meet.—</p>
         <p>8. I had intended to write you more largely at this time, and with particular reference to the state of the Natives; but I find, that I must hasten of my packet as the vessel sails, and therefore have not time to do so. A pious settler from the Waipukurau ( who has been a local preacher among the Wesleyans at Wellington,) called on me the other day, wishing to spend the Sunday with me here. I was grieved to hear him state, that there is now no Sabbath among the Natives; Sunday being the principal buying and selling day; and he was also surprised hear me state, how quietly and properly the Sunday was formerly observed. Card playing, Drinking of Strong Liquors, Petty Thefts, and other sins, are, alas! very common. The Congregation <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, in the largest Chapel, varies from 10–25, and that on the Sunday morning only; in the other villages the falling-off is still greater; still the Papists have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gained <hi rend="italic">one</hi>!!! All this is no more than I had expected: provided that the Bishop (not knowing the people) should be determined to <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>carry every thing his own way. You may depend upon it, that the worst is yet to come; unless something suitable shall timely be done. I, myself, know of but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> way; but this I cannot now propound; lest it should be said, that I seek my own welfare. I have heard, that Mr. S. Williams told some of the Natives inland, that they should honor the bishop; they replied, “We honored him formerly, on his two visits, but not now.” And this feeling is, I know, getting stronger. Wairarapa (so long coveted) has just been sold to the Government; and <hi rend="italic">now</hi> Mr. McLean is at Te Waipukurau, come to pay the Natives <hi rend="italic">all at once</hi> (contrary to the Agreement), and to endeavor to get more Land; through which there is great conflicting of opinions among the Chiefs; but <hi rend="italic">all</hi> say, that these evils have come to pass in consequence of <hi rend="italic">the bishop</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic"> and the Governor</hi> putting me down; and much more which I durst not write.</p>
         <p>9. I keep myself entirely at home. I see but very few of the Natives; although if I were either to visit them, or let them know that I would <hi rend="italic">gladly</hi> receive them here, I should, I know, have them all with me. Even the Chief Karaitiana <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>Takamoana wrote me a letter begging me to receive him, &amp;c., but I have refused to have any thing to do with him. The principal Chief Tareha with his brother came the other day, having heard that I was about leaving, (which report arose through my selling a few articles to some whites—I not having received any pay from the E.D. Comee. since Decr./51,) and said, That they came to tell me “<hi rend="italic">not to go</hi>; but to wait and <hi rend="underline italic">see the end</hi>.” (a very expressive sentence). And, on my saying (on another occasion) to Te Hapuku, that I heard the Governor was coming, he replied—“What have we to do with the Governor: Thou art our Governor.” From some of the Christian Natives I get the very best of Letters; in fact I had scarcely supposed that they could write such epistles.—</p>
         <p>10. You will (doubtless) have heard, that the Bishop had quite enough to do at his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> place on his return; and on account of which (knowing as he did the state of his college before he left,) it would, perhaps, have been better for him (and for us) had he remained at home. Mr. Barker, too, who was to have written to me “a <hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>severe letter as Chn. of the E.D. Committee”, has not only not done so, but has had quite enough of his own matters to engross all his mind. Mr. S. Williams who was appointed here, is not coming. Mr. Burrows was subsequently appointed, and he too is gone in another direction. And Mr. Paul, who was also fixed upon to look after “the College,” will not come. And now I hear that the Bishop of N. Zealand is about to be translated to the Metropolitan See of Sydney, to which, I suppose, he will proceed, leaving me (like Felix did Paul) bound.—Certainly there is more in all this than is apparent at first sight.</p>
         <p>11. I patiently await the arrival of your letter respecting me. I hope that you (at least) will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have followed the Bishop’s track; for I consider the Extract from the Minutes of the Central Committee to be mainly his doing; in fact, it is grounded upon his Letter. And here I may say, that this also appears to me to be <hi rend="italic">another</hi> breach of the Canons of our Church (at least of their spirit), which decide, that “none <hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>shall be cited into several courts for one crime.” (Can. cxxi. &amp;c)</p>
         <p>12. I venture to enclose a Copy of a Letter which I have very recently written to the Rev. R. Cole; as from it you will gather more respecting me, and also obtain my thoughts upon a few important matters.—</p>
         <p>13. You speak in your Letter of August/52 of my seeing your Publications. We used to do so, though never consecutively; but I have not seen any throughout the two past years.—</p>
         <p>Pray for me, my dear sirs,<lb/>And ever believe me,<lb/>Your unalterably attached<lb/>And obedient<lb/>(although erring) Servant,<lb/>William Colenso</p>
         <p rend="center">(Copy.)</p>
         <p>Mr. Wm Colenso,</p>
         <p rend="end">Auckland 12 March 1853.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Under the same cover with this I send you an extract from the Minutes of Central Committee requesting you will be good enough to quit the Ahuriri Station.</p>
         <p>I am Dear Sir<lb/>Your most obdt, servant,<lb/>(signed)<lb/>Robert Vidal.</p>
         <p>Addressed,<lb/>“Mr. Wm. Colenso,<lb/>Ahuriri.”</p>
         <p rend="center">(Copy)</p>
         <p>“At a meeting of the Central Committee held at Auckland 2 March 1853.—</p>
         <p>Read, par. First of President of Central Committee’s Letter, Novr. 27/52.—</p>
         <p>Read Letter of Revd. J. Hamlin Decr. 20/52.—</p>
         <p>Resolved,</p>
         <p>That the connexion of Mr Colenso with the Church Missionary Society ceased on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Novr. last, when the Rev. James Hamlin placed the Bishop’s Letter of Suspension in his hands.</p>
         <p>2. That if Mr Colenso should still be on the Ahuriri Station he be requested to leave the same without delay.—</p>
         <p>Extracted from the Minutes</p>
         <p>(signed)</p>
         <p>Robert Vidal</p>
         <p>Sec.”</p>
