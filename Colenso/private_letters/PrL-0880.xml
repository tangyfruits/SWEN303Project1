         <p rend="end">Napier, August 28/93.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>Your long full &amp; interesting letter of the 16<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. (posted, Wgn, 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>.) I have received, also, your 2 excellent papers w. it, (“Inland Printer”, &amp; Japan!) and thank you for <hi rend="italic">all</hi>: and as I am w. you in your dislike of our letters crossing in transit, I write this night, hoping I may be quite in time to prevent such a <hi rend="italic">calamity</hi>!—At the same time I must tell you I do not <hi rend="italic">feel </hi>well enough to write, and I have been in this uncomfortable <hi rend="underline italic">lazy</hi> state for several days! &amp; so <hi rend="italic">wasting </hi>much precious time which (w. the fretting over it) only throws me more &amp; more back.—However I have several items <hi rend="italic">chalked </hi>down (last wk.) for you, and these I hope to be able to give.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, yr. remark <hi rend="italic">re Anamooka</hi>, &amp; your failing to trace it: it is one of the <hi rend="italic">Friendly Isl. Group</hi>, about 1½°. N.W. from Rarotonga; in Admy. Cht. the <hi rend="italic">Group </hi>is termed “<hi rend="italic">Hapae</hi>” (also from Cook, who surveyed the 3 principal isles, &amp; has given a <hi rend="italic">nicely excd. chart</hi> of them in his <hi rend="italic">large </hi>“Atlas”—calling them, “Hapae, Anamooka, &amp; Eooa”; and Williams (L.M.) also gives <hi rend="italic">these names </hi>in <hi rend="italic">his map </hi>of the S. Pacific—M. Stations, &amp;c.)—One or more of those famous, never-to-be-forgotten—pictures of Cook’s <hi rend="italic">grand </hi>doings (or, rather, of those of the Islanders,) is taken at <hi rend="italic">Anamooka</hi>; you see I am discursive over this little enqy., &amp; research, because it gave me much pleasure—as it would <hi rend="italic">also you</hi>, had you been here.</p>
         <p>Second: <hi rend="italic">re that </hi>art. in “<hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>”, Dr. Spencer found it &amp; sent the no. to me: it is in <hi rend="italic">Novr</hi>. no. 1202: and contains about ⅔rds. of my paper in vol. XXIV, &amp; printed <hi rend="italic">correctly</hi>: perhaps you may now see it.—–</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>Horse (&amp; hum.) hair <hi rend="italic">changed </hi>into eels!!! that old old story of my boyhood: strange that such should be believed <hi rend="italic">now</hi>! You are right in classing it w. the <hi rend="italic">Barnacle-Goose</hi>! But you are <hi rend="italic">not </hi>right <hi rend="italic">re </hi>our pretty little “quinquevulnera”: this sp. does not change, but the white-petalled one does—<hi rend="italic">at times</hi> assume a pale pinkish: such is old; long known at Home, and mentioned in our Brit. Botl. works—by Hooker, Bentham, &amp; others; there are also <hi rend="italic">other specific </hi>differences; so there are <hi rend="italic">2 valid old sps. </hi>As you say both are here <hi rend="italic">w. us</hi>—plentiful on the Beach below—running E. from town, &amp; here in my paddock. “<hi rend="italic">Silene</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">q</hi>.”, and “<hi rend="italic">S. anglica</hi>”: there are a round dozen of sps. of this genus in Engd.—</p>
         <p>Another of our <hi rend="italic">old </hi>settlers has just passed away—Mr. Annabell senr.—died at Boyle’s beyond Havelock: a connection by mge. with the Chambers family: I believe he painted those 2 portraits of W.M. and his (attitudinizing) wife, that adorn (?) the Athenæum. Perhaps you knew Mr. A. I see, in Nr. Papers the death of Dr. Shortland: and Von Mirbach is <hi rend="italic">here in Hospital</hi>, very bad w. ulcerated stomach. Rev. R. Frazer has been laid aside: D. Sy. at Hastings: 2 Sundays—but I am right glad to find that R.F. was again able to take duty yesterday. They are about to build a <hi rend="italic">new </hi>Pn. Ch. at Havelock: unfortunately their present one was built of <hi rend="italic">White Pine</hi>! &amp; consqly. is rapidly being turned into dust!! Tenders are being called for. I was much pleased with your kindly remembg. me w. those 2 papers: How well that “Inland Ptr.” is got out of hand! its plates (or cuts) are <hi rend="italic">beautifully executed</hi>: I cannot understand their superior style of working them: I have a copy of the “Academic” from Craig (5 4to. nos.) and I give the prize to your “Inland Ptr.” for the manner in which it is got out. And then the Memoir of G. Didsbury! w. portrait—another (saddened) pleasure—for while I have had several letters from him (&amp; kind ones, too,) I never knew him—nor saw him. I should, however, have missed your <hi rend="italic">long </hi>contribn. therein—had it not been for the “<hi rend="italic">Index</hi>”, there I saw <hi rend="italic">something </hi>that caught my eye, &amp; then I went for “<hi rend="italic">R.C.H</hi>.”—<hi rend="italic">in propria persona</hi>: I like your article, all but about Te Kooti, there I think you are <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>. (Read again, my “Fiat Justitia”: (can furnish copy if required): I have always said (and I <hi rend="italic">know </hi>have lost in so saying), that the P. Bay folks (or their band of mercenaries) <hi rend="italic">brought </hi>that horrible retaliation on themselves. Rusden is clear &amp; right—in this. Only by last Mail from Engd. I recd. a letter from a gentleman—who had lived many years here in N.Z., in the Auckland Province,—in which he says of Te K.— “<hi rend="italic">that ill-used man</hi>”: posterity (I hope) will do him justice. I shall return these 2 p. with this. That Japanese man is a genius, a hero! I <hi rend="italic">feel </hi>qualmish! <hi rend="italic">small</hi>, very, by his side: <hi rend="italic">not worthy </hi>to carry his pantoufles! I sent you that <hi rend="italic">wretched </hi>paper from America (U.S.)—supposing you had not received <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a thing!! How I should like to see a Tax put on all <hi rend="italic">such advertising</hi>.—I mean, that <hi rend="italic">incessant </hi>reduplicating—or reiterating—with cuts!! In “D.T.” this evg. is the death of 2 sons (8 &amp; 10 yrs) of Mr. R. Sporte, Waipukurau, of diphtheria, &amp; both within a few minutes of each other! I am sorry to have to tell you—that our 2 p. (H. &amp; D.T.) have added <hi rend="italic">another full </hi>col. of <hi rend="italic">trash</hi>— “<hi rend="underline italic">Bicycling</hi>”.—–</p>
         <p>I have lately recd. a pretty large book, royl. 4to. (or perhaps, impl. 8vo) from U.S. put up into a nicely formed <hi rend="italic">case </hi>of thick paper made to suit, with a flap like an old fashion pocket-book, and the 4 corners <hi rend="italic">fully </hi>protected with loose angles of tin-plate. &amp; since then another book from Hamilton, of which its corners are similarly protected—but with parchment <hi rend="italic">repeatedly doubled, &amp; hard as iron</hi>, w. patentees mark stamped on ’em. This improvement has long been wanting.</p>
         <p>You seem to have got some excellent <hi rend="italic">thin </hi>paper! 4 sheets to ½ oz. <hi rend="underline italic">Good</hi>: and you have <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, in your usual able &amp; graphic style, given me a first-rate acct. &amp; description of <hi rend="italic">your society </hi>meeting: Woe’s me! that <hi rend="italic">I shall never know of any such here</hi>. I believe that our friend Hamilton would also fall under Maskell’s lash for sending off &amp; <hi rend="italic">selling </hi>(high fig.) Moa bones: and I know, from Stephani direct, of Kirk sending him Hepaticæ!!!—– (Keep this—i.e. these 2, <hi rend="italic">private.</hi>)</p>
         <p>I am right glad to hear of your being <hi rend="italic">busy in P.O</hi>. (but I fear I shall be doing you &amp; yours, a grievous wrong, in being the means of your writing me such <hi rend="italic">long </hi>lr.) What is your brother now doing? <hi rend="italic">the Printer</hi>: could you (soon) find wk. <hi rend="italic">for 2</hi>? I trust yr. bror. in Engd. <hi rend="italic">will enjoy </hi>himself <hi rend="italic">fully</hi>. I am rejoicing w. you, that your bairnies have <hi rend="italic">all passed </hi>well through the measles epidemic. Last week I sent my “<hi rend="italic">A.</hi>” Ms. to Wgn., to c/o. Capt. R., &amp; Stout. I was glad to <hi rend="italic">get rid </hi>of it, yet sorry, because my attempting to review it, <hi rend="italic">proved to me</hi>—that <hi rend="italic">my time </hi>for <hi rend="italic">all such work</hi>, is <hi rend="underline italic">forever fled</hi>—<hi rend="underline italic">gone</hi>!! But I must <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, (even to you,) write on this head. Do not be in any hurry about Quatrefs., take full time over it &amp; deal plainly &amp; faithfully to <hi rend="italic">your </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">old</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> friend</hi>. I am selfish enough to wish that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were <hi rend="italic">near</hi>! I have been out but little of late, though weather fair, &amp; fine at times: last night I went to Augustine’s &amp; heard Canon Fox: he is to leave for P. Bay. in about a fortnight.</p>
         <p>Do you recollect Noah Huke? (I <hi rend="italic">see </hi>him now, as before Richmond &amp; Co.) poor fellow! blind for many years, and now that Dr. Mackenzie (from your town) has operated on him—<hi rend="italic">he can see.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Now to your last letter:—<lb/>Yes, I much want “that pretty little book” back—<hi rend="italic">I have not looked into it</hi>, but as I opened the packet I sent it off to you—marking on thick brown <hi rend="italic">wrapper</hi> “to be returned, but <hi rend="italic">not </hi>the wrapper”. From Sir James H., in reply—saying that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> (you) <hi rend="italic">had agreed just as I had written </hi>to him re Handbook N.Z. Flora: I had ventured to remark, Maskell’s <hi rend="italic">Coccid. </hi>should be dealt with as Browns <hi rend="italic">Coleopt.</hi>—a <hi rend="italic">separate </hi>vol.</p>
         <p>Have not seen anythingof Kipling’s Song, &amp;c, &amp;c. Never mind “Nature”, now. Very much pleased to know of safe arrival of yr. Brother—<hi rend="italic">so far</hi>: <hi rend="underline italic">also</hi>, of your being <hi rend="italic">busy </hi>in office: and trust your family are now <hi rend="italic">all quite well </hi>from Measles. I have mentioned <hi rend="italic">Rees</hi>, and his Memoir of G.G.—it is <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, that R’s. “adopted daughter”, who died here a few weeks ago, was <hi rend="italic">the main worker at that</hi>: she was “buried privately”, R. at Auckland.—</p>
         <p>During the past week we have had several days of really fine weather. “Old H.B. w. come back again”, they sd. to me in town. Last Monday (a week <hi rend="italic">before </hi>time) our Sy. held their Augt. mtg.—cause, P.S. McLean was going to Auckland, and, in their agreeing to do so would read his paper on <hi rend="italic">Cremation </hi>before he left, and they had no other papers: I did <hi rend="italic">not </hi>go—<hi rend="italic">Mail time</hi>. Dinwiddie, Hon. Sy., tells me— “<hi rend="italic">another</hi> p. from T. White on Mao. Dog”!! I noticed, on your old office— “<hi rend="italic">Times Restaurant</hi>” (both front &amp; side) in <hi rend="italic">very large </hi>letters! some <hi rend="italic">may </hi>take it—Meals accordg. to the Times!—I am keeping well: shall not go inland to Bush this month: <hi rend="italic">plenty to do</hi>.—</p>
         <p>With kindest regards &amp; best wishes</p>
         <p>Believe me yours very truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">P.S. </hi>Shall <hi rend="italic">not </hi>return 2 papers with this—but in a day or two.</p>
