         <p>Mr J. Drummond</p>
         <p>Ongaonga</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I do not like to be in anyones debt, not even in the way of letter writing, and as tomorrow is your mail day, &amp; you may be ex­pecting a line from me, I now write—for your kind and open letter of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Your honest free and manly remarks I like much, I have re­ceived some like them from folks here, &amp; inland too; we want very much more of plain open fair &amp; honest speaking—especially in theologi­cal matters—than we get from any quarter; &amp; while, I fear, this gen­eration must be content to <hi rend="italic">look forward</hi> to something better, the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> may be priviledged to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">possess</hi> it, if only its warm <hi rend="italic">morning</hi> beams.</p>
         <p>I was pleased to hear of your having received the 2 copies of “Trans” XIV, as I had sent them by rail without any letter to you. I also sent you a D.T. last week to inform you of our meeting; I wrote that little account myself at <hi rend="italic">2 am</hi> on Tuesday (after returning from <hi rend="italic">that</hi> meeting &amp; our Council one;) before I went to bed;—I was tired, <hi rend="italic">very</hi> &amp; therefore, (and <hi rend="italic">for other reasons</hi>,) left out all remarks on my paper—though much was said, &amp; I had a special vote off thanks for it. You will have seen that we have 5 new members.</p>
         <p>I am now going to turn our attention to <hi rend="italic">our Spiders</hi>—2, at least,­—<hi rend="italic">one</hi>, your bank-dweller, and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> my long-legged fellow from the bush, but I want more books bearing on them than I have at hand, as their <hi rend="italic">number</hi> is legion, &amp; there are 1000’s described.—If I can succeed in writing a short paper on them, it won’t be read until (perhaps) the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of our meetings for this year. By the way I may tell you that I was pleased to see P. Dolbel, Balfour, of Glenross, Rearden, of Meea­nee, Sturm of Clive, &amp;c, (Country members) at our meeting on Monday,—­I could not help thinking of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> when I saw Dolbel &amp; Balfour.</p>
         <p>I expect it is pretty cold with you today; it was here this mor­ning. Ruahine is looking grand under her pure white covering, &amp; the sun shining on it, Those lovely little Alpine Plants so nicely drawn by Buchanan in Vol XIV are now deeply covered with snow; I always think of them and their numerous companions up there on those summits, when I look out of my end window on the snows.</p>
         <p>The Paper of mine on “the Colour Sense of the Maori” seems to have attracted attention, both N. &amp; S.—(do not omit, when you read it, to read the “addendum” at p.477)—Last night in reading the fortnight­ly Review (April No) I was pleased with a Paper by Montagu Lubbock on the <hi rend="italic">same subject,</hi> &amp; arriving at <hi rend="italic">precisely the same conclusions as myself</hi>—even quoting the same authorities.­</p>
         <p>Had you not better post your books <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi>? every Saturday, or<hi rend="sup">.</hi> Monday evening, &amp; make a rule of doing so?</p>
         <p>And now with kind remembrances to you all 4 (though one unknown at present). Bel. me, yours truly</p>
         <p>
