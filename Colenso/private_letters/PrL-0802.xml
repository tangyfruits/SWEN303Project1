         <p>My dear Mr. Mantell,</p>
         <p>I have determined to send my paper on those unhandsome remarks of the Quarterly Reviewer <hi rend="italic">re </hi>your esteemed deceased Father to the “Wellington Philosophical” to be read there—I being a Member of the same. So I forward it this day to the care of the Secretary Mr. Gore:—and I have also written a note to the Director of the Institute Sir James Hector about it, asking him, as a <hi rend="italic">brother-</hi>Geologist of your late Father, to support it: and observing that <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, as his son, might like to see the Paper <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that it is read.—I hope you may both be able to be present at its reading; it has been long ready, and I might have sent it before.</p>
         <p>Now that Hamilton has left us, there is no one that I know of—among my probable audience of our Society, should I read it <hi rend="italic">here</hi>,—that would care 2 straws about this paper: it would “be caviare to the general” (as Hamlet says)!</p>
         <p>I think you will agree with my paper—throughout,—I hope so.—</p>
         <p>             With kind regards,</p>
         <p>                     I am,</p>
         <p>                                     Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>                                     W. Colenso.</p>
