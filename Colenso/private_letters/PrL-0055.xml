         <p>Mr. — — — — — — — <note xml:id="ftn1-60" place="foot" n="60"> There is an almost exact copy addressed to “Mr. Russell, residing at Te Ẁatakahawai.” Archives 48/547-682.</note>
            <lb/>(Called by the Natives of<lb/>Te Kopi, “Eraihia”,)<lb/>residing at Te Ẁatakahawai.</p>
         <p rend="end">At Te Kopi, Novr. 18, 1845.</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>I have been informed by several Natives of this village and neighbourhood (which information has since been confirmed by many respectable persons at Wellington), that the Europeans residing in the Wairarapa Valley, yourself, and (<hi rend="italic">in particular</hi>) the men employed by you among the number, have been speaking of me in a most unwarrantable manner; imputing many things to my charge of which I am utterly ignorant. At the wish, therefore, of some of my friends at Wellington I write you this (you being the European resident nearest to this place,) to request you, your men, and the other Europeans residing at Wairarapa, to substantiate those charges which from time to time you have been pleased to make against me. I intend (by Divine permission) to pass through the Valley of Wairarapa towards the end of February next, when I shall make it a matter of duty to call upon every European resident in the valley, for the purpose of enquiring into this matter.This I should <hi rend="italic">now </hi>do (as I fully intended on my leaving this place for Wellington,) but I have to proceed without loss of time to my Station at Hawke’s Bay, to prepare for the arrival of the Bishop, who will be there in a short time.</p>
         <p>The Bishop intends being here on or about the 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. December next, when, if you, or any other European residing at Wairarapa have<hi rend="bold"> </hi>any charge to prefer against me, you will have ample opportunity of so doing.</p>
         <p>I am, Sir,</p>
         <p>Your obedient Servant</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
