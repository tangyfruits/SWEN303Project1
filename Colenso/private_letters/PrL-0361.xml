         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand, <lb/>March lst., 1878.</p>
         <p>A. Luff Esq.,</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours of Jany. 2 (&amp; 3) was received here on 17th. Feby.! Quick despatch, seeing that your January <hi rend="italic">S.F</hi>. Mail left you, also a week <hi rend="italic">earlier</hi> than time. I was pleased to find my letters had reached you before you wrote,—because those in the Country were not so fortunate. I had scarcely anything from Engd. by that Mail save from you: and Grubb tells me that it was the <hi rend="italic">smallest</hi> M. (by several bags!) for a long time. We <hi rend="italic">both</hi> think that you <hi rend="italic">acted rightly</hi> in not allowing yourself to be imposed on at P.O. for <hi rend="italic">Xmas</hi>. Illustd. papers.</p>
         <p>My last to you was a month back, <hi rend="italic">also</hi>, w. a little Roll of <hi rend="italic">photos</hi>., which I hope you may safely receive.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">February</hi> has been a remark. month <hi rend="italic">here</hi>,—w. <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, &amp; with others too.</p>
         <p>Several deaths,—prominently Bp. W., Barney Rhodes, &amp; Capt. Read: those 3, with myself (making 4) were, I suppose, the <hi rend="italic">oldest</hi> in these parts of N.Z.—including Wn. 3 are taken (within a few days of ea. other) &amp; one, the writer, is left, <hi rend="italic">to follow</hi>. Bp. W. died on the 10th., sank gradually like a dying lamp! he was buried on 12th. (evening) a <hi rend="italic">large</hi> funeral, all shops closed, Wilson (lawyer) and I walked together; it was a dreadfully hot day, dry &amp; <hi rend="italic">dusty</hi>, &amp; such a tramp, from the house to saddle, Shakesp. Rd.,—down that Rd. &amp; through town, up to saddle in Milton Rd., &amp; then to Cemetery! I was nearly done up!—“Joe” had just came back <hi rend="italic">again</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> </hi>from Wgn., when, lo!, By. was gone! out came a paper (or sub-art.) on the greatness &amp; goodness &amp; wisdom &amp; <hi rend="italic">riches</hi> of By. &amp; that “<hi rend="italic">he had died</hi>
            <hi rend="underline"> </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">childless</hi>”, &amp; that Mr. Jos. wd. come in, &amp;c. &amp;c. and away goes “Joe” to Wgn. Lo! by will, By. had left <hi rend="italic">all to his daughter</hi> (some say, £400,000) and a <hi rend="italic">handsome</hi> annuity to his widow &amp;c.—Heigho! Joe returned, breathing anything but love, &amp; won’t wear mourning nor allow any of the family to do so!! and, as usual, the yg. woman is not By’s daughter at all. For my part I <hi rend="italic">commend</hi> By. <hi rend="italic">highly</hi>; when I was at Wgn. (in ’65), &amp; visited at his House, she was there with him, just like a nice <hi rend="italic">Eng</hi>. girl, with her Governess, &amp; her playmates—daughters of town settlers,—&amp; By. (I saw) was much attached to her. I must not forget to add, that Locke, too, was blowing high!—&amp; thinking of going to England!!— </p>
         <p>Capt. R. <hi rend="italic">dropped down</hi> suddenly in his house, dead: he was here about 10 days before looking as well and as active as ever. (I fancy he was down about re-leasing Giffard’s property).</p>
         <p>Mr. Marshall has sold off <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, &amp; is going “home”. So has Wellwood. Mrs. (Dr.) Gibbes has left for Engd. w. her baby—to see if the sea-voyage may save her—poor lady! Witty put his knee out &amp; cracked some sinews in playing cricket at Wairoa: he is here now, on crutches, &amp; in Dr. Hitchens’ hands. I see all his Wairoa Property is in the market. Fannin is to lose his billett as Immig. Agent &amp; Fox is to have it! Brought about, I believe, in a curious way. F. wrote (a 2nd. time) to the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Govr. to <hi rend="italic">raise</hi> Fox’s salary (only £60) &amp; at last, an ansr. came. Yes, it would be raised, &amp; <hi rend="italic">his </hi>(F’s.) done away!! (I have <hi rend="italic">heard</hi>, that Fox was <hi rend="italic">privately</hi> for Sheehan &amp; Buchanan at last election). It is <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, that Miller, has been talked of! &amp; Tabuteau (got a reprimand!) &amp; Scully I think has heard <hi rend="italic">something</hi>—Sheehan is <hi rend="italic">here</hi> now, he arrd. 2 days ago.—</p>
         <p>See Grey’s (mad) speech at Wellington, (in Wgn. Papers)—the “Loafers” (whom every right-minded Settler dislikes, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> hates) are some of Grey’s <hi rend="italic">especial</hi> ones who are to have the franchise,—that is, if he can effect it. And see, also, a nice little letter in <hi rend="italic">same</hi> paper, anent Grey &amp; his new taxation. (Speaking of taxation, <hi rend="italic">this evening</hi> R. Williams, collector, was here, leaving his papers, <hi rend="italic">demands </hi>for £10.18. 6!! ½ year’s rates). I had called for tenders for filling in the <hi rend="italic">corner</hi> only of 316—one t. was £150, another £85 and I find stuff. Weber told me, that he could not have his filled in, for it would cost more than it would fetch! &amp; mark, the moment anything is done, or half done, down comes the Valuator to re-raise the Rates! It was even proposed in our M. Council, to re-value Buildings which were half-up, or altered, <hi rend="italic">since</hi> valuation 4 months ago!! Palmer told me that Pocock paid £110 (contract) for filling-in his ¼ ac., corner of Cl. Sq., whereas Palmer had (last year) offered to do it for £80., wh. P. would not give. What makes the diff.? I asked. Why, the call, or Order, of the Corporation, <hi rend="italic">to have all done at once</hi>!</p>
         <p>In my last I told you I was awaiting the decision of the Edn. Bd. <hi rend="italic">re</hi> myself. They would <hi rend="italic">not hear</hi> of my resignation, but increased the pay: so that it is “Go on, old Horse! You’ll do <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> longer, there’s extra oats &amp; a ribbon &amp; a bell!” All very kind,—but it won’t make the old Horse any younger! The pay, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, is fair (£300. &amp; £150. travg. allowance), but the question will be, Can I perform the duty required? The travelling I <hi rend="italic">don’t</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">like</hi>, particularly the risky voyaging. However, I <hi rend="italic">may yet</hi> “run away from it”; there are certain elements rising, I ken, in the composn. of the Board: &amp; I intend to stand to my colours, no ministers have any business there,—unless they are <hi rend="italic">retired</hi> from active duty.—</p>
         <p>Now a little of <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> griefs (<hi rend="italic">to you</hi>). On 13th. Feby. some wretches killed my dog <hi rend="italic">Carlo</hi> here near my door—<hi rend="italic">beating his head in</hi>! they will trespass—especially by night &amp; the dogs bark after them; our poor dog was here in his old berth, on the mat in the porch, at xi.30 he ran out after some, &amp; they managed it. I put an advt. in papers <hi rend="italic">in hopes</hi>! but no, now for the <hi rend="italic">sequel</hi>: the next week they poisoned my other remaining dog (the little terrier) <hi rend="italic">here, at my door</hi>! he never went to town alone, &amp; never absent at night. James let him out of the kitchen at xii p.m., the dog came to his sleeping mat, folks passed (as usual) &amp; the next mg. the poor faithful dog was cold! My man went sick over the affair, &amp; could not eat. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> may <hi rend="italic">guess my</hi> feelings. These dogs were the pets of all the boys &amp; others who come here—greatly liked. I am more alone than ever <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, &amp; I feel it, do what I may. I told James, that had this happened 2 months ago, &amp; he also <hi rend="italic">then</hi> giving notice, I would have stood to my resignation of Office &amp; go home,—utterly careless of place &amp; everything! They are leaving me &amp; I have an advt. in our Papers—I have had <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of applicants (most of them <hi rend="italic">now in places</hi>) but which, or how, to choose, bothers me.</p>
         <p>I have been laid up a week or more w. <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> diarrhoea &amp; vomiting (which left me <hi rend="italic">very weak</hi>). James’ wife said it was thinking about the dogs, but the disorder has been very prevalent, the newly arrived <hi rend="italic">U.M.</hi> Minister is now confined from it.—Your friend (<hi rend="italic">Member</hi>, I might say) Capt. W. Russell is better, but by no means quite well: I was sorry to see him looking so altered. A curious election has just taken place at Wgn., Travers resigned (going to Engld.), Pearce stood, so did the late Mayor, and a fellow in gaol (a hot headed Irish lawyer, who has been, <hi rend="italic">after many</hi> warnings committed for a month for contempt of Court!) well, this man got <hi rend="italic">returned</hi>!! only, too, a new hand at Wgn. He was an Orangeman &amp; <hi rend="italic">they</hi> voted for him in a block! he was an Irishman! &amp; the <hi rend="italic">R.C.</hi> also voted for him, and so the respectable &amp; well known Mr. Pearce was nowhere! And then “Who would have thought it!!” I much fear <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Colony of N.Z. has yet a lesson to learn from <hi rend="italic">Democracy</hi>; it may be a severe one: <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may see it. The Scotch Ch. held their anniversary on Monday; &amp; the Methodists on Wednesday. You will see all about both in Herald;—something said at both which I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> agree with.</p>
         <p>Duncan of Waipawa bankrupt—I had expected this.</p>
         <p>One case of our Institute books sent by “Wesley” (per “Khedive”) have arrived here in good condn.: now where are they to be kept? last year we passed a resolution (of mine) to ask Govt. for leave to keep them, in a neat Book case in the Grand Jury room; &amp; I wrote offy. to J.D.O., (our President,) but he was too busy (I suppose) &amp; so nothing came of it: I am thinking of asking Sheehan! Strange to say, I received by last M. a letter from Mrs. Col. Wyatt, enquiring about her (late husband’s) land at Havelock &amp; Porangahau. P.D. told me, a few days back, he had lately bought 3000 sheep (Merinos) to stock his Petane Run. Strange (I have often thought) he telling <hi rend="italic">me</hi> all that, and – – – – <hi rend="italic">some</hi> would say the strange part of the <hi rend="italic">business</hi> is on <hi rend="italic">my side</hi>!—</p>
         <p>I was <hi rend="italic">grieved</hi> this week to find poor Mick Boylan bring up <hi rend="italic">F.E.</hi> Hamlin for an old debt, over £60., &amp; H. <hi rend="italic">pleaded</hi> Stat. Limitn.!! H.R.R. lost <hi rend="italic">both</hi> his trials w. his Brickmaker (in spite of <hi rend="italic">Rees’</hi> oratory) &amp; serve him right! I hear the law costs were ever £50. </p>
         <p>The telegrams give us <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> news <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the poor Turks: which I am sorry for. One <hi rend="italic">good</hi> telegram which <hi rend="italic">pleased me</hi>, was Bradlaugh &amp; Mrs. Besant gaining their cause at Court of Appeal: I partly expected that. And this reminds me of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> note, (on my asking you to get me a copy of his Book,)— “B’s. book I have not seen, much was said &amp; written against it”.—Exactly so: &amp; therefore I wished to see it. Were you not in <hi rend="italic">London </hi>I would not have thought of asking <hi rend="italic">you </hi>to get it for me; but in L., you or I might buy anything—a man’s skull, if you will,—&amp; no one knows you, or cares to know you. Some of your last Papers were excellent,—good sound reading, in articles (D.T.) &amp; the judgments &amp; sayings of the Judges,—who act (too often) like the Monkey &amp; the Cat’s Cheese! I amused both Cotterill &amp; Lascelles w. that of the 6–7 successive Mortgages, &amp; V.C. Hall.—</p>
         <p>Parkin, I am sorry to say, is not yet gone to Wairoa,—the bar has been again closed, so at Mohaka &amp; Porangahau, &amp; the steamers shut in prisoners; but they are all out again. <hi rend="italic">Our Bar</hi> is said to be much deeper.—I see they have put up 2 public seats, w. backs, &amp; on a flat stone platform, on Beach; 1, near W. end of Sup. Ct. Ho. &amp; 1, between sd. Ct. Ho. &amp; <hi rend="italic">your</hi> old office. A very good &amp; substantial stone fence, dressed face, &amp; several feet high, is putting up around the R. Cath. School ground: the Duck pool in front of Morley’s is filled in—nicely. Cohen (Jew) is going in for a Hotel, corner of Sale &amp; Munroe Streets—<hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> my Sn. A warrant out against <hi rend="italic">Dr. Dale</hi> for deserting wife &amp; daughter at Oamaru. Allanach, <hi rend="italic">Senr</hi>., is just dead—Friberg, too.</p>
         <p>And that is about all my <hi rend="italic">news</hi>!</p>
         <p>Now to your Business remarks <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Black, &amp; sn. at Wairoa. It is right that we should speak “plainly” (as you say) in these matters, but, I confess, I don’t understand <hi rend="italic">you</hi>! However I shall say little about it: if Black offers <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, which I will try to get him to do, I will let you know. What I meant, in mine to you, was <hi rend="italic">of course</hi>, your selling price: whoever before heard of such a thing,—as sections to be offered for sale, &amp; no price fixed! and the owner the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> side of the globe!! And even now, in reply, &amp; refusing B’s offer, you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> given any price—or any <hi rend="italic">clue</hi>!!—</p>
         <p>I believe (from Grubb) that he got in reply, from Wairoa, that there was an error, overcharge, as to <hi rend="italic">your rates</hi>. But Mr. G. has been (like myself) very busy of late, so that I have only just seen him: &amp; he is too tired (not being <hi rend="italic">over strong</hi>) to come <hi rend="italic">this way</hi>—of an evening, being so far in the wrong direction. Holder’s 2nd. foreman in now leaving him! &amp; that to set up in <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi>!! see Advt.</p>
         <p>Should those Books (Lin. Soc.) be <hi rend="italic">all right </hi>&amp; you (or D. &amp; Co.) have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> made any arrangements about sending them, hold on a while, or enquire of Wesley, (who <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have some to send, &amp; then they can come in <hi rend="italic">one case </hi>but if so, I wod. <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> it shod. be packed &amp; sent by Dixon,) I am remitting to Wesley by Mail though I fear I shall have no time now to order any thing from him—may by next Mail.</p>
         <p>And now, my dr. sr., I must once more wish you &amp; yours <hi rend="italic">well</hi>—which I do in every way heartily, and with kind regards.</p>
         <p>I am, yours very truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
