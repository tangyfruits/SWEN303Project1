         <p rend="end">Napier April 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1880</p>
         <p>Mr John Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours of yesterday received last night, and thank you for it. I regret however, that I did not answer your former letter, so as to let you know it had been received—as you now enquire after it; the truth is, that I wished to see my Lawyer again, about Kea­ting, which I have only done <hi rend="italic">this day</hi>; (being partly stirred up by your re-enquiry of last evening); I had not been to town before for <hi rend="italic">this month</hi> (April), &amp; only twice in March; I dislike the Town, &amp; only go there when business calls—or <hi rend="italic">drags</hi>;—</p>
         <p>Keatings affair is a <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> one; and that all owing to <hi rend="italic">Barry</hi>—for at the time B sold that to K, it was <hi rend="italic">not his</hi> to sell!! He having <hi rend="italic">al­ready conveyed that land to his wife.</hi> Of course, had he lived a lit­tle longer, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> might have been set to rights, for the 3-partite deed, B, wife, &amp; K was drawn by Lee, &amp; had been signed by K—but that was all. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> she has conveyed to K—&amp; K to the bank;­—</p>
         <p>If I prosecute—I must go in against <hi rend="italic">all 4</hi>;—B, wife, K, &amp; Bk;—I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> lose on technical &amp; subtle points;—or I might prosecute Mrs B as Barry’s Executor, &amp;c, and she—<hi rend="italic">to save her husbands name, might</hi> give in—but this is doubtful, as she would be sure to be guided by her lawyer, &amp; he, of course, would look out for his costs from someone; So all things considered, I fear I must consent to <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">loss</hi>—which <hi rend="italic">now</hi> includes a few pounds more of extra &amp; fresh expenses; it is a pity that rogues can get so well off under the fiction of law­—but so it is.</p>
         <p>I now turn to more pleasant subjects;—I was much pleased to find that <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, too, agreed in what I had written <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the “Sabbath”. I did not notice what you refer to as having seen in the “Graphic” about it—in fact, I did not read it, only (child-like) looked at the pic­tures; &amp; was pleased with the large one P of W &amp; Beaconsfield—as their likenesses were good., and no doubt, the room, &amp;c, is correct—­which caused my boy Willie to send it to me. I also had a very ex­cellent paper the “Scotsman” printed in Edinburgh, which contai­ned a good deal on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> subject—a long &amp; <hi rend="italic">good</hi> article by the Edi­tor, which pleased me much, &amp; <hi rend="italic">several</hi> letters from correspondents; it all came out in this way; the sad accident on the Tay took place on a Sunday;<note xml:id="ftn3-37" place="foot" n="37"> On the night of 28 December 1879 at 7.15pm, the Tay bridge collapsed after its central spans gave way during high winter gales. A train with six carriages carrying 75 passengers and crew plunged into the icy waters. All 75 lives were lost; the event is celebrated in William McGonagall’s doggerel epic.</note> &amp;, for some reason or other for some of the <hi rend="italic">bigotted</hi> Scots, that was enough; Dr Begg in particular, came out flaming with zeal; &amp; went so far as to say, that God had purposely pushed, or blown, them over!! to death, of course, and to – – –. But the better &amp; sounder men among the Scots, thereaway, took it up at once, as above. It was on that account, the paper was sent out to me. In it was the commencement of the hearing of that affair before the Commissioners appointed, &amp; among other witnesses was a Rear Admiral (Marriott I think), who had been living there many years on the banks of that ri­ver &amp; not far from the bridge; he, as an old sailor and a Scienti­fic man came to give his testimony as to the strength of the storm, &amp;c—Now this gentleman is an out-&amp;-out Sabbath man, &amp; he, &amp; his, had gone to Church that day, &amp; also <hi rend="italic">that very evening</hi> in the height of the gale;—well, his old walnut trees, of more than 100 years; the pride &amp; glory of his place, &amp; fruitful bearers too, were all smashed; nearly level with the ground;—I sent that paper to <hi rend="italic">Gow</hi> Waipukurau to read &amp; then lay on the table public library there—and I wrote, on it,—If Beggs God shoved over the train for Sabbath breaking, who smashed the poor old Admirals walnut trees when he was at Church?. Beggs God? No, the Admiral was a strict keeper of the Sabbath; The Devil, then?—Well, but———You may finish the sentence. I thought on <hi rend="italic">you </hi>when I sent off that paper; but I wished for a few at Waipukurau to see it.</p>
         <p>I suppose you read what I wrote on the Sabbath in the Newspaper; I got it republished in Tract form,—correcting a few errors made by the printer—&amp; I now do myself the pleasure of sending you a copy &amp; would send ½ dozen more if they would be welcomed your way.<note xml:id="ftn3-38" place="foot" n="38"> 1878 <hi rend="italic">Tracts for the times; No. 1, On the Sabbath and its due observance</hi>. Dinwiddie, Morrison &amp; Co., Napier. (First published as letters to <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi>). 46p.</note>
         </p>
         <p>I may tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—that I should have <hi rend="italic">continued</hi> those Tracts—as I had agreed to do—but I found there were difficulties in the way,—Newspaper men, <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, look to their <hi rend="italic">pocket</hi>, &amp; to <hi rend="italic">please</hi> a <hi rend="italic">few </hi>among their customers. I should like much to go on with those Tracts, and so to have told the present generation a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> more—which I have gleaned by the way—the long way I have come.</p>
         <p>Now a word on your <hi rend="italic">peeping</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">prying</hi> into Natures stores after her ferns, &amp; other plants—go on &amp; prosper; but you must have a good pocket glass to find out her beautiful little concealments. I shall always be right glad to help you in these pursuits; any fern, or plant, you may meet with, which seems new or strange, or one which you would like to know the name of—just send me a bit of it (much like what I now enclose. You may put 20 small scrap specimens when dry into a common letter without overweighing it—but they <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be <hi rend="italic">bearing</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">seeds</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fruit</hi>—which they generally do <hi rend="italic">underneath</hi>, as in 2 of these scraps now sent; and then, if, from the sample, I should wish for more (in case it should be new, or strange), I could just tell you of it.—Always let the specimen be a <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> one—<hi rend="italic">not</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">dwarf</hi>, or of a <hi rend="italic">Giant</hi> plant same kind.—I hope you did not suffer from the rains; I fear the state of the country will prevent my visiting as I had purposed;—</p>
         <p>     So goodbye, &amp; believe me, yours</p>
         <p>             very truly      W.Colenso</p>
