         <p rend="end">Paihia, Jany. 9/41</p>
         <p>Willoughby Shortland, Esqr.,<lb/>Col. Secretary<lb/>&amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>On the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ulto. I had the honor of writing His Exy. the Lieut-Govr. (in ansr. to a Letter which I had received from him) on the subject of my printing the “Gazette Exy.” &amp;c,—in which I expressed my willingness, as far as compatible with my duties, to execute what I could in the Ptg. Dept. for H.M. Govt. in N.Z.—</p>
         <p>—On the same day I left Paihia on a visit to the Natives who reside on the Coast; owing to Indisposition I was obliged to return much sooner than I intended, arriving here last evening. On my return I found several Letters awaiting me, one of which, from “the Secretary of the Com. of Missions. of the N.D. of N. Zealand”, is the cause of my now writing you.—A Copy of which Letter I enclose for His Exy’s. Information.</p>
         <p>You will, of course, my dear Sir, readily perceive that, in conseq. of my having recd. these Instructions, I shall not in any case be able to print anything more for H.M. Governt., without first receiving the sanctions of the Com. of Missionaries, and which, I think, may best be obtained by applying to them thro’ their Secretary.</p>
         <p>Praying you to be pleased to make this known to His Excellency the Lieut-Govr., and, also, to the New Zealand Land Commissrs. for their information, with as little delay as possible—</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>My dr Sir</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>W.C.</p>
