         <p rend="end">Norsewood,</p>
         <p rend="end">(“70 mile Bush,)</p>
         <p rend="end">80 miles S. of Napier,</p>
         <p rend="end">March 15. 1886.</p>
         <p>T.F. Cheeseman Esq. F.L.S.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your letter of the 8<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. has only just reached me here,<note xml:id="ftn3-339" place="foot" n="339"> A copy of Cheeseman’s 8 March 1886 letter survives in the Auckland Museum.</note> and as I shall not be returning to Napier till near the end of this month (just to catch outgoing S.F. Mail), I write at once to acknowledge receipt.</p>
         <p>That memo of a “Tour in N.Z.” you speak of, was also published in pamphlet form in Tasmania. The copies I received have long ago disappeared: I think Kirk had one of the last from me, &amp; possibly he may have it still.—</p>
         <p>As to spns. of H.B. <hi rend="italic">Coprosma</hi> I think I may be able to send you a <hi rend="underline italic">few</hi>—<hi rend="italic">if any left </hi>from a case I sent last spring to Kew, and of its arrival there I have only just heard from Sir J.D. Hooker &amp; Mr. T-Dyer: these, however, are described by me in “Trans. N.Z. Inst.”—only last week I was collecting fruits of one of them for Kew, in a dense forest a few miles away, and now I will get some for you, if the weather keeps fine: (very fine of late, &amp; hot, too,—77º this day in my cool room!)—</p>
         <p>Of spns. from that “Tour,” I fear I have none: I never cared to collect for self, or for “exchanges,” but only as well as I could (in those days of toil) for Kew.—</p>
         <p>I will write to you again, soon after my return—if then free from Govt. work, at which for several months I have been labouring far beyond my strength, and only escaped hither last week to recruit.</p>
         <p>I am, Yrs. truly  W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Petrie, some 2 yrs. ago, wrote to me for spns. of <hi rend="italic">Coprosma</hi>: and I then sent him what I had. W.C.</p>
