         <p rend="end">Napier, Feby. 10/66</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours of 14 Jany. (from Oruru) only reached me 2 days back. I had previously received yours from Bay of Islands (written about Xmas.)—and <hi rend="underline italic">I much regret</hi> I had not known of your <hi rend="italic">N. </hi>movement: as I could have pointed out to you some marked (&amp; easily found) localities, where plants peculiarly N. are found—and of which specimens are desired—but you may have found them:—besides, a few geologl. remarks on things formerly noticed. I wish I had got your 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. letter from the N. <hi rend="italic">earlier</hi>—as, then, I could have replied with some chance of finding you still there.</p>
         <p>The “Manawau” (? <hi rend="italic">Manoao</hi>—as I once wrote it,) is (I suppose) the <hi rend="underline italic">true</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> Dacryd. Col. </hi>I found it near Whangaruru in 1840,–1; I quote a portion of what I then wrote about it (as pubd. by Sir W. Hooker in the “Lond. Jl. Botany” for 1842, p.301,)— “The king of the whole lot is my new Pine from the high hills near the E. coast. For many years I had heard of this tree from the aborig., but could never obtain a sp…. They said it never rotted; and they reserved it (when detected) to hold the remains of a deceased chief, &amp;c. — — The tree is about 50 feet high, and 2½ in diamr. In appearance it somewhat resembles the <hi rend="italic">Kahikatea</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dacryd. excelsum</hi>) and I venture to suppose that it may constitute a new &amp; connecting genus between <hi rend="italic">Phyllocladus </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Dacrydium</hi>: this however you will ascertain…. I send also a spn. of the wood. The bark on the trunk is deciduous, but not like that of the <hi rend="italic">Totara</hi> which is fibrous.” And in Sir W’s. “<hi rend="italic">Icones Plantarum</hi>”, part XI., Jany. 1843, is a plate (no. DXLVIII) and description.</p>
         <p>I know that <hi rend="underline italic">Dr.</hi> H., (“Manual”)—speaks of my finding it at Taupo (Tongariro &amp;c)—but <hi rend="italic">I </hi>have ever ventured to believe the “Taupo” plant to be a different sp.—so, I would also say respecting your plant from Otago—ditto of Menzies from Dusky Bay—ditto of Haast &amp; others, Canterbury:—and now, your <hi rend="italic">not</hi> recognizing as identical, the N. with your S. plant confirms my suspicion. I am glad you found <hi rend="italic">Colensoa</hi>—an excessively local plant; Cunningham, &amp; myself (some 5 years after him) only found it near the Whangaroa. I wish you had got <hi rend="italic">good </hi>sps.—and <hi rend="italic">seeds</hi>, or a <hi rend="italic">living root</hi>, I had long intended to get from the N.</p>
         <p>If I decipher correctly your concluding sentence— “Have you ever been North of the Great Sandhill district?” I must answer “<hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>”. I travelled from Hokianga (mouth) to Cape M.V.D.—by Coast: thence back to “<hi rend="italic">abreast</hi>” of Mt. Camel (<hi rend="italic">W. </hi>Coast) thence <hi rend="italic">across</hi> to Ohora, Rangaunu, thence Kaitaia—Whangaroa, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
         <p>There are several <hi rend="italic">choice</hi> things in the <hi rend="italic">N. Dist</hi>.—among which are, a <hi rend="italic">Drosera, Calorophus, Fagus, Lycopodium, beyond Kaitaia</hi>; a <hi rend="italic">Cassytha </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">Todea</hi>, near Mt. Camel, a peculiar <hi rend="italic">Veronica</hi> at Cape M.V.D.,—an <hi rend="italic">Asplenium</hi> on the Coast,—a <hi rend="italic">Laurus</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Nesodaphne </hi>(which I still believe to be distinct) in the woods—leaves much larger than <hi rend="italic">N. Tawa</hi>—&amp; glaucous underneath, &amp; back very black. &amp;c, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>But all these are from memory—after 23 years of absence!</p>
         <p>I hope you will have found some <hi rend="italic">dozens</hi> of good <hi rend="italic">new things</hi> in Botany: leaving out what <hi rend="italic">you </hi>are <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> to find in stones, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>I exceedingly regret to find, from Wgn. Papers, that a serious robbery has taken place at the Museum, in which I fear yourself &amp; <hi rend="italic">Mantell</hi> are great losers: such conduct is <hi rend="italic">doubly</hi> bad.—</p>
         <p>I have heard nothing from Dunedin: are they getting on with the “Essays” at all! I have lately had a long letter from Dr Hooker, who enquires eagerly after the “Essays” and—who is well again. You will be glad to hear the <hi rend="italic">kumara </hi>roots I sent him,—while at Wgn.,—reached “in splendid condition”. The boxes of <hi rend="italic">Crypts.</hi> had also been just received.—</p>
         <p>Let me hear from you, as to your discoveries &amp;c &amp;c—when you may have time.—</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours very sincerely</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
