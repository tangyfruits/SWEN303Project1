         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Your plaguy vessel gave me the slip—and Capt. Lewington, too, served me much as you did when last here, sailed, in another vessel without calling as he promised to do. So I cannot send your daughters watch; at which I am quite vexed.</p>
         <p>I write this, and leave it with Walter, to send to you by some Native going that way; just to let you know how things are with me.</p>
         <p>I got home on the Saturday night, very well; my cold, however, though little, still remains. I leave on Monday (the 17th.) by Styles’ vessel for Auckland—and suppose I shall be three weeks or so absent.</p>
         <p>Mr. Busby left yesterday (Good Friday) for Sydney; obliged to be content with a berth in the <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> of the Shamrock! I am quite sorry for him.</p>
         <p>Mr. Williams is not yet returned from Oruru, nor has <hi rend="italic">any </hi>fight yet taken place—save that little skirmish in the onset, in which 4 lives were lost. I suppose the old gentleman intends to tire them out.</p>
         <p>The Bishop is not gone to Auckland, having received the sad news of the death of his Mother; which has affected him very much.</p>
         <p>Mr. Dudley is well and preaching.</p>
         <p>Mr. Taylor and family have sailed for Wanganui.</p>
         <p>The Columbine is sold to Stratton for £600;—I suppose he will have a £100 for this first voyage.—I do not know of any other news.—</p>
         <p>With kind regards to your good <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> wife—and daughter—and all your bairns—whom I pray God to keep and bless.</p>
         <p>               I am, my dear Sir,</p>
         <p>                               Very truly yours,</p>
         <p>                                               W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>I should like to hear how you got on in Kahunui’s case: I had a long talk with Iwitahi’s party on the subject.</p>
         <p rend="end">—W.C.</p>
         <p>Kier is doing of nothing; <hi rend="italic">if you think he would suit you</hi>, you had better send him a line: <hi rend="italic">wages is not an object with him</hi>.</p>
