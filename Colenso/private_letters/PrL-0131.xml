         <p rend="end">Waitangi, October 28, 1853</p>
         <p>My dear Cole,</p>
         <p>Your last note, dated, 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> ulto., (by, I <hi rend="italic">suppose</hi>, the “Salopian”) I did not receive until some time after she had sailed from this place for Turanga. As it had no postmark, and as I had also sent purposely to the P. Office, and got “no Letters” in answer, I suppose that it came by some private hands. I thank you much for it, and for what news it gives; for although I hear of papers being very plentiful about us I never see one, neither do greatly care to do so. Mr. S. Williams had been here several weeks <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> for the Governor about the pieces of Land, and returned about the time of the date of your Letter. From him I had also heard of the expected translation of the Bishop.  I perceive one or two things in your letter which seem to require a correcting remark or two of mine; otherwise you may be led to believe them wholly true. Some of them—<hi rend="italic">one</hi>, at least—(i.e. “the prevailing belief, I believe, on the part of the Bishop &amp;c. is, that you had tried to regain the person of the mother of the child into your command”:) you ought never to have heard from my respectable person. You know well, what has often been the consequence of a <hi rend="italic">suppressio veri</hi>; and, that this is not far from (if not leading directly to) a <hi rend="italic">suggestio falsi</hi>. This infamous story like evil disposed Natives of this place—Karaitiana Takamoana &amp; Leonard Te Kawepo—trumped up just before the Bishop’s arrival here;—got the better disposed Natives to believe it, and then the manner &amp; circumstances of both the Bishop’s &amp; Mr. S. Williams’ coming, did the rest. But I told the Bishop <hi rend="italic">solemnly</hi>, when we (3) were together, (I was going to say, in <hi rend="italic">verb</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">sagerd</hi>, than which I know of nothing stronger,—but, I correct myself, I am but a <hi rend="italic">Deacon</hi>) that it was <hi rend="underline italic">utterly</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">false</hi>; and this should have satisfied even him—for, whatever my faults are, no man shall ever be able truly to charge me with falsehood, even in trivial matters—but it did not. It has been said, That he who would aspire to the high title of Historian should be possessed of the temper of impartiality &amp; the predilection for truth &amp; Charity—and <hi rend="bold">[2]</hi> they are seldom found apart—absolutely needful for such an one; how much if then a Bishop sitting as a Judge! but the <hi rend="italic">very contrary</hi> on <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> these points is the case. I recollect reading; that in the passionate strife of the Great Rebellion, common rumour was used by the Puritans as a ground for the internment of Stafford; but that ill precedent has found little favor in better times (till now). The allegation of common fame is now indignantly repudiated and shown to be utterly repugnant to every rule of law &amp; every sentiment of justice. To give even you a complete understanding of this position of the affair would require a deal of writing: let it suffice to say—that I did endeavour to get the mother to come and look after her own infant (Mrs Colenso having <hi rend="italic">no girls</hi>, and then as we supposed, being about to leave, when I would be left with the child,) and in so doing—which I did <hi rend="underline italic">openly</hi> before <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, with the certain knowledge of the Bishop being on the way hither,—that he would know all—I <hi rend="italic">believe</hi>, that I acted most properly. In truth I may tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, that it was my intention—supposing the Bishop had acted as a “Father &amp; Friend” wishing to do the best for all parties in a bad matter, to have asked him to <hi rend="italic">aid me</hi> in my so doing. It never once occurred to me that such could ever be misrepresented, even by Natives, much less believed by the Bishop!! And here you must not forget that the girl was given <hi rend="italic">me</hi> by her mother at the Bay of Islands in 1844, who made me only <hi rend="italic">publicly</hi> promise never to allow her daughter to go to any <hi rend="italic">kainga</hi> thereabouts;—that, the Native with whom she now lives is my redeemed slave lad, brought up by me from his almost infancy through 18 long years—my steward, carpenter, in fact, almost everything; so that no native <hi rend="italic">here</hi> has any right to interfere; that I then greatly needed his <hi rend="italic">immediate aid</hi> in the carpentry line, through the recent ruin of the dwelling house, having previously tried to get the 2 white carpenters living here to work for me, but both being already under agreement they could not. Now, you yourself know somewhat of the burden of having a little child to attend to; but such is light, in a town, compared to what it is in a place like this &amp; at <hi rend="italic">such a time</hi>!—<hi rend="italic">where, now</hi>, a person gets <hi rend="italic">nothing of any kind but what his own hands prepare. </hi>
         </p>
         <p>Then again, you say, “A Priest after a lapse would, or should, I think, on his true repentence, he is reinstated; while a Deacon <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>under similar circumstances <hi rend="italic">would not</hi>. This is a very good law; and I suppose an old one. But then what is comprehended (according to the meaning o our Church of England) under the word “Deacon”?—(Let the Rubric at the end of the “Form of ordering of Deacons” inform us, at least in part, and, the part too which I wish to bring before you.)—A <hi rend="italic">young unpractised Minister, inexperienced &amp; newly admitted</hi>, who had <hi rend="italic">never</hi> had care of souls. Does the writer, then, belong to this class? It is difficult to write about one’s self, doubly so when under official censure, but as we are often betimes led into error or mistake, by the use or abuse of words it is almost needful that I should here say a little about myself. And, in so doing, I have now no need to state to you (as I once did to the late Bishop of Sydney, and often to the Bishop of N. Zealand,) that I was repeatedly called and sent to Eccleciastical duties—or, Missionary work, <hi rend="italic">preaching the Gospel</hi>—by the (then) highest Eccleciastical authorities in the whole Southern Hemisphere! In Sydney by Marsden, Hill &amp; Cowper, in N. Zealand by <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the old Ministers, some of whom are now Archdeacons. So that for several years (before the Bishop’s arrival in New Zealand) I was engaged in similar duties to those of a Deacon in England although still a Layman &amp; under many disadvantages. True, I was not then a Deacon—some may say “I was a Catechist” but I was far more than a Catechist—i.e. according to the ancient &amp; legitimate usage of the word. I was, in my own opinion, an <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>: (I use this word although I am aware that this Office has been by some Divines supposed to be above even that of a Presbyter—but this perhaps is doubtful.) Now it has appeared to me, that my having been thus called &amp; sent (and <hi rend="italic">owned</hi> in my work, I must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> omit this,) is a widely different thing from a Dissenter’s ordination;—or, that of a person going forth by his own self uncalled &amp; unsent (which distinction, I fear, the Bishop of N. Zealand never allowed in his mind concerning me). Be this as it may, I have ever been especially clear in my own mind upon this matter; and I may here, perhaps, quote a few sentences from an <hi rend="italic">Authority</hi>, whose words, I know, you will fully allow, &amp; with which I quite agree:— “Now whereas some do infer, that no ordination can stand, but only <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>such as made by Bishops:– – – – – to this we answer, that there may be sometimes very just &amp; sufficient reasons to allow Ordination made without a Bishop – – – – – Another extraordinary kind of vocation is, when the exigence of necessity doth constrain to leave the usual ways of the Church, which otherwise we would willingly keep: Where the Church must needs have some ordained, nad neither hath nor can have possibly a bishop to ordain; in the case of such necessity, the ordinary institution of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> hath given often times, and may give place – – – – –These cases of inevitable necessity excepted, none may ordain but only bishops: By the imposition of their hands it is, that the Church giveth power of order, both unto Presbyters and Deacons.” (Hook. Eccl. Pol. 1. vii., c. xiv s11.)<note xml:id="ftn2-16" place="foot" n="16"> Richard Hooker “Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical polity”, Volume 3, Chapter 14.</note> Now I have given all this first to let you know what you may have already quite gathered) that I consider myself as more than a Deacon i.e. <hi rend="italic">in the common Ch.-of-England acceptation</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">of the word</hi>,—even as I <hi rend="italic">told</hi> the Bishop, “an old experienced and successful Missionary, leaving my very enemies to judge.” But there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> need for me to go back so far, as this is now more than 9 years, since I was made Deacon, (a period of time which, you, my good friend, would not have liked to pass through as a mere deacon,)—&amp; further still, the Bishop himself told me, when here in 1852, that he wished me to prepare for Priest’s Orders.—</p>
         <p>While then I agree with you (as I have already said, understanding, also, the proper meaning of the term Deacon,) in your statement respecting the non-ordination of a <hi rend="italic">Deacon</hi>; to carry this out in its severity against <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, would, I dare think, be anything but just. “<hi rend="italic">Summum jus summa injuria</hi>,”<note xml:id="ftn2-17" place="foot" n="17"> “Extreme right is extreme injury.”</note> is an old adage; worthy perhaps of being here borne in mind.</p>
         <p>Therefore I can <hi rend="italic">not</hi> acquiesce, in the sentence never being reversed. In fact, such would make, the sentence of suspension (one of the lighter Ecclesiastical censures, according to Palmer, and issued “for a <hi rend="italic">limited</hi> time,”) to be one and the same with Degradation—which is the <hi rend="italic">heaviest</hi>. But how much even of this <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> may have been secretly <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>determined against me is hard for me to say; seeing that Mr. Vidal as the official organ of communication from the Central Committee (whose President is the Bishop) addresses me as a layman; in which he is (kindly?) followed by my neighbour Mr. Hamlin, and others.</p>
         <p>I assume, that I have no need to point out to you what you must already well know; and yet I may be permitted to recall such to your mind:—namely, my not having been liked at any time by the majority of the different parties who have had a prominent share in the matter. These parties I may class as three, (exclusive of the Papist Priests; and of the Bishop of whom, here, I do not wish to say anything:) viz. the Government, the Settlers, and the Natives. <hi rend="italic">The Government</hi> disliked me greatly, <hi rend="italic">I know</hi>—because I had <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> to aid them getting hold of the Natives’ Lands, and because they could see that I encouraged the natives to withhold the selling of the same as well as for other reasons, also well-known to myself. <hi rend="italic">The Settlers</hi> you yourself have heard speak, and they have also gone so far as to publish in the Paper several years ago their wishes to get me removed; so of them, therefore, I need not now say anything. <hi rend="italic">The Natives</hi>, (who are nationally like a silly flock of sheep—all follow the leader, like leaves in the forest when blown by the wind all in a line one way,) may, in this matter, be compared to our own “<hi rend="italic">people</hi>” at an election time: one party of them was told, that in my being cut off they would have a College &amp; <hi rend="italic">2</hi> Clergymen, one to look after them, and one after the College, which was also to be upon their own ground: another party was told that they were to have watermills, and ploughs, and I know not what and “500 sheep given by the Governor,” to ensure which they now make over to the Bp. their own <hi rend="italic">reserved</hi> Land, (which they did!) and to which the Governor was to add a similar piece, which is now (according to the Surveyors; my informants;) 8000 acres!! Another party had hoped to get the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Minister to reside with them, (the future <hi rend="italic">Mission Station</hi> having already been fixed): to another party I, or rather, Religion, was too strict: while another party knew very well that <hi rend="underline italic">I knew them</hi>, and it would be such <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>a nice thing to commence afresh with a stranger before whom they would be <hi rend="italic">sheep </hi>alike: while another party (a “little flock”) were dared to visit me. Now add to this that my own very wife was <hi rend="italic">actively</hi> against me and the cup is full: the picture is completed. I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">one</hi> speak a word for me! It is true; I had never sought nor desired anything of the kind. My hope was (and is) where it has ever been—in <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> alone, and through Him, I feel assured, that I shall always overcome; but I do not always realize this. Still, He left not himself without a witness. His voice spoke powerfully in the unsolicited heart; and Hapuku (the Heathen Chief; and Puhara (the Papist one), although both enemies, bravely stood up at two different times and spoke to the Bishop before the Governor in my behalf. The Bishop has put me down, (and I, bearing in mind <hi rend="italic">my oath</hi>, have obeyed him; and he has gained 8,000 acres of Land (“a goodly price;” &amp; bush) and he has appointed 3 Clergymen here, (none of whom are coming); but, he had, also, done himself an immense deal of injury and the Natives of the district a still greater one. I would not wish the Bishop’s share of this matter (as I understood it) upon my conscience, not for the 8,000 acres of Land! It was only <hi rend="italic">last</hi> year that the Bishop; after a great deal of trouble, succeeded in getting the Governor’s assent to a small bit of land, which had been given at the Otaki &amp; Waikanae to him for a school there; while here, where “there is just no one for the College or School,” (Mr S.W.’s words;) more than 20 times that amount of Land—one-half being Government property—is given without a word! “He <hi rend="italic">that runs may read</hi>.”<note xml:id="ftn2-18" place="foot" n="18"> Habakkuk 2:2. And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.—King James Bible.</note>
         </p>
         <p>Reviewing all that has been dealt to me in this matter as a man—I have been treated more as a person under Anathema (of the greater Excommunication,) than anything else. It is this exceedingly severe &amp; uncalled for treatment, which has <hi rend="italic">confirmed me</hi> in my views, and which will (allow me to say) be found to have been peculiarly disastrous to my flock. My case, from the first to last is an <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> one, and must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be judged by <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi>
            <hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>rules; or, if so, great must necessarily be the error. Hence it was that McLean made such an erroneous judgment. Bp. Hall, I recollect made a fine remark somewhere on this point. I think it is upon the story of Moses slaying the Egyptians. Here there is <hi rend="underline italic">no injured</hi> husband, nor is the young woman the <hi rend="italic">less</hi> in esteem—just the contrary. Perhaps you will say, such a state of morals ought not to be, I am not, however, speaking of what ought to be, but what <hi rend="italic">is</hi>; of matter of fact. Each age, my friend, (and each people too) has an atmosphere of its own; and, as in archery, the truest aim may suffer from the prevailing air:—may none of my stern, unloving judges ever be tempted as I have been.</p>
         <p>But I must hasten to close; at least, this theme. Still, what the heart is full the mouth speaks &amp; the hand writes. I doubt, that few, if any, (of all classes) have ever been reclaimed through such <hi rend="italic">harsh</hi> measures; and this I think, is a truism, pretty generally received now-a-days—at all events at home. I am sure that I have ever found it to be so in all my dealings with men: and I myself am but man; no exception to the common rule. You, doubtless, recollect the words (not wholly unsuitable <hi rend="italic">here</hi> which John Milton<note xml:id="ftn2-19" place="foot" n="19"> “Paradise Regained.”</note> puts in the mouth of Satan, as saying:—</p>
         <p>—————————“If all hope is lost<lb/>Of my reception into Grace; what worse? <lb/>For where no hope is left, is left no fear.”</p>
         <p>How very, very often had this been sadly realized. I think that it was in the case of Athanasius himself although a great man &amp; a Bishop, that something of the kind occurred; fully verifying the saying that “oppression (or, harshness) maketh the wise man mad.” <note xml:id="ftn2-20" place="foot" n="20"> Ecclesiastes 7:7.</note>
         </p>
         <p>—And then, with reference to my “making some provision for the future—many years it may be”—as you kindly suggest. This I cannot do, chiefly because I have not, and never had, my heart set that way! My trust is (&amp; must be) in <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> for this as well as for other matters. I do not believe that He will suffer me to want; yet, even this <hi rend="italic">may be needful</hi>, and if so, it will be. <hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>If I had no other reason for prolonging my stay here, surely this one would be sufficient—that <hi rend="italic">here</hi> I can live (<hi rend="italic">sans</hi> comfort, you may say,) at a comparatively low charge; my garden &amp; orchard &amp; cow &amp; goats go a great way to keep me at little expense beyond my own labor, having 5 years ago paid the Native Chiefs a handsome price for right of grazing upon the adjoining marshy flat. Of course, when I thus speak; you will bear in mind, that, whether the C.M.S continue me in their service or not, <hi rend="italic">this spot</hi> will not be again required for a Mission Station; and, that all of good or use, which there is now upon on it, is either of my own processing or the work of my own hands.</p>
         <p>I have very little of news which I can send you from this quarter. Of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> state of the Natives about me, I would gladly be excused saying a word to any one. I know what they <hi rend="italic">were</hi>, down to the hour of my injudicious &amp; ill-timed suspension; (I speak this with exclusive reference <hi rend="italic">to them</hi>,)—I then feared what, they might become. You, at Wellington may yet know more of them than you may wish. Remember, it was <hi rend="italic">only</hi> Alexander who could ride Bucephalus. A Native proverb runs,— “Pull away the centre post, &amp; the house falls”: and (without, I trust, inexperience;) I may <hi rend="italic">to you</hi> quote, “Smite the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.”—From the 2 or 3 good, and, as I hope really Xn. Natives I often get the best and most affectionate of Letters; which are highly consoling to me—far more so than if they came from European relations or friends. Archd. W. Williams has lately arrived at Turanga. Mr. Grace is at Taupo; preparing I suppose, (or they hope,) for settling down there. Mrs Colenso left here on the 30<hi rend="sup ">th.</hi> of August, overland for Te Wairoa, (this I think you had heard,) &amp; thence per vessel on the 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> instant taking the <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> (though <hi rend="italic">despised</hi>) child with her; for which part (in all the circumstances) I am very thankful. I hope they are both safe, and where Mrs. Colenso’s heart is long before this. I shall now, please <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> expect to hear concerning my other 2 children of whom I now know next to nothing. My daily prayer is, that <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> will be pleased (if fit) to bring us <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> together again: We are now <hi rend="bold">[9] </hi>sadly separated: but I am sometimes gladdened in thinking that they—the mother and little ones—are all together and in the very bosom of her family; who are all settled and neighbours.—</p>
         <p>I hope, my dear Cole, that you have, ere this, proper domestic help at least; it must be very sad for you to be without it. But servants &amp; laborers of every kind, even Natives, (and that <hi rend="italic">here</hi>!) are getting above working; demanding &amp; obtaining 5/- per diem &amp; upwards! This want of labor will be a great drawback to the prosperity of N. Zealand. The Natives of this neighbourhood (I am told) demand 2d. per pound for taking wool to the harbour! Last year they had a 1d.; and if they succeed now in getting their 2d. as sure as they next year demand 3d. or more. So that a strong native would easily carry 120 lbs. of wool from one of the Stations to Ahuriri in one of these long days &amp; thus get a £1. for his day’s labor! Not that they take the wool this way, for it is always carried by canoe. I used to give 30/- for 9–11 weeks heavy travelling; I expect, that if I had now to perform those journies I should not get a native to go with me, (if I got them at all) for less than £5. for the trip.—</p>
         <p>I think you know, that there was only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> European built house at Ahuriri (proper), and that one a licensed <hi rend="italic">Public</hi> House; now there is another building there, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> side of the Entrance, (the first being on the opposite side,) which is also Licensed for the same purpose!</p>
         <p>I am sure that you will think that I have written you enough—both as to quantity &amp; quality—and therefore I close. You may make what use you please of this Letter. And with every good wish,</p>
         <p>Believe me, my dear Cole,<lb/>Yours very sincerely<lb/>William Colenso</p>
         <p>Rev R Cole<lb/>Parsonage<lb/>Wellington</p>
