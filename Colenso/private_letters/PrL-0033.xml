         <p>J.P. Gell, Esq.</p>
         <p>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>V.D.L.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Since my Note to you of November last, I have been honored in the receipt of yours of Augt. 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, together with a copy of No. 9 of the “<hi rend="italic">Tasmanian Journal</hi>”.</p>
         <p>I now send you a paper containing an account of several new Ferns, which I have lately discovered and classified. I have had this ready some time ago, but have been waiting, expecting to see something of those papers already sent, and which, I suppose, will ere long, come to hand. In <hi rend="italic">this</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">paper </hi>I have included those six ferns formerly described. Should that paper have been inserted in any no., you will, I suppose, merely notice them again in their place in this paper, something in this way—<lb/>—<hi rend="underline italic">L. linearis</hi>, n.sp., vide, no.  , p.            .—<lb/>The descriptions, however, here given of<hi rend="italic">those </hi>Ferns, will, I think, be found to be amended a little, in perspicuity, and correctness of detail of minute particulars.</p>
         <p>I have sent a copy of my Ms., with dried specimens, to Sir W.J. Hooker, and should be gratified in having this paper inserted at an early opportunity, as I much wish to be able to send him a printed copy.</p>
         <p>I have another paper nearly ready— “Memoranda of an Excursion in N. Zealand, with remarks on its Natural History, &amp;c.”, which, I venture to suppose, will give more general satisfaction than the enclosed.</p>
         <p>I hope you received my <hi rend="italic">corrected </hi>paper on the Bones of the Moa, in time to supersede the first one sent.</p>
         <p>I think I mentioned in my last, that I had not received Nos. 2 and 3: I would thank you, my dear Sir, to get me copies of those numbers forwarded. My friend Rev. R. Taylor, informed me, that he, also, has not received any Copies of those two numbers, and would be obliged to you in your causing such to be sent to him. Mr. T. has, moreover, suggested, that our Society may have some such regulation, as to allow Members copies of those numbers only in which they may happen to have a paper. If this supposition is correct, we would gladly become subscribers, in order to get copies of each number <hi rend="italic">as printed</hi>.</p>
         <p>I hope to be able to send you the paper I have to hand before the expiration of this month.—</p>
         <p>Believe me to remain</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>very truly yours</p>
         <p>Willm. Colenso.</p>
