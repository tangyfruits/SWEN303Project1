         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>March 26, 1888.</p>
         <p>Mr. John White<lb/>Wellington.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Your friendly note of the 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi> instant (reminding me of days long gone by!) with accompanying kind gift of a Book lately published there at Wellington, are to hand, and I thank you heartily for thus thoughtfully remembering me. I have no time at present to look into the book—that I intend to do after Easter, up in the solitudes of the “70-m-Bush,” on some rainy day or day<hi rend="underline">s</hi>—when I expect to find a <hi rend="italic">treat</hi>: you <hi rend="italic">may </hi>again hear from me.</p>
         <p>Your note took me by surprise, for I had no idea you were at Wgn. rather at Auckland, or somewhere N. enjoying <hi rend="italic">kumara</hi>!</p>
         <p>I suppose this book to be a copy of what Didsbury has advd. in the “Kahiti.” I first saw that advt. when up in the Bush in Feby., and on my return to Napier a fortnight ago I ordered a copy which has also <hi rend="italic">lately</hi> arrived;—but, as yet, I have <hi rend="italic">not untied </hi>the parcel!—</p>
         <p>I had also <hi rend="italic">early</hi> received a copy of a work of yours published last yr. by the Govt.—yet (strange as it may seem) this, too, I <hi rend="italic">have not yet seen</hi>!!.</p>
         <p>I have <hi rend="italic">very little time for reading</hi>, save some Botanical and Theological (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> Ecclesl.) works which I must look at.</p>
         <p>I hope you are keeping well, I am at present, save too frequent attacks of Rheumatism for comfort!—but I manage to keep on— “faint but still pursuing.”—</p>
         <p>E hara taau i te tahae: he hanga nea iho. Ko taaua ano taaua.—</p>
         <p>Why did you not ask for <hi rend="italic">Maori</hi> originals? You should have had them with pleasure, if <hi rend="italic">I could readily find </hi>them.</p>
         <p>Tregear wanted some Karakia’s (tu-a-makutu) but I could <hi rend="italic">not </hi>find them among such a lot! and <hi rend="italic">time</hi> with me is <hi rend="italic">doubly precious now</hi>. With kind regards, Believe me,</p>
         <p>                                                     Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                                             Wm.. Colenso.</p>
         <p>I have addressed my letter thus: as you have not given Street, &amp;c., and fearing there may be other <hi rend="italic">J. Whites</hi> there.</p>
         <p>                                                             W.C.</p>
