         <p rend="end">Napier, March 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.<lb/>1893.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Mantell</p>
         <p>Your note of 16<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. containing enquiry of the colour of <hi rend="italic">Fagus solandri </hi>is to hand.—</p>
         <p>1. I quote from Hooker’s “<hi rend="italic">Icones Plantarum</hi>”—which also gives good figures (Tab. DCXXXIX, vol. VII.)<lb/>“Male flowers (<hi rend="italic">immature</hi>) clustered 3 or more together, nearly sessile, densely clothed with <hi rend="italic">red-brown</hi> shining imbricating bracteæ————anthers <hi rend="italic">exserted</hi>.”</p>
         <p>2. The anthers are <hi rend="italic">red</hi> &amp; rather showy at times, when numerous &amp; fully expanded, but are not to be compared with those of the <hi rend="italic">Rataa</hi>. Of course, Hooker only saw them <hi rend="italic">dried</hi> &amp; unexpanded (<hi rend="italic">immature</hi>).</p>
         <p>I believe you have a copy of the “Ic. Plantm.” in one of your libraries (Gen. Assy. or Col. Musm.) and I should like for you to see Hooker’s figs. (<hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi>), which are far better (more natural) than those in “Forest Flora.”</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>your query respecting the (unfortunate) “Dictionary”—which <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> yourself </hi>initiated just 30 years ago! (Eheu!)—the Govt. abandoned us—it and me! And that, too, <hi rend="italic">repeatedly</hi>—by almost every Govt.!!! who took us up, and then dropped! Ballance, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Stout</hi> (who saw <hi rend="italic">both</hi> me and <hi rend="italic">the work</hi> here, &amp; urged me afresh),—then Atkinson, <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, and when Capt. Russell was Col. Secy. he gave Instructions to Didsbury to publish the first part (then with them for <hi rend="italic">press</hi>),—but, on Ballance becoming Premier, it was “countermanded,” and official notice thereof was sent to me!——</p>
         <p>Tregear had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> (and used?) my Ms., for <hi rend="italic">he told me so in his letters</hi>: we had corresponded freely, (he often asking <hi rend="italic">Maori </hi>questions,—and I, in my happy ignorance, answering them,) but I never dreamt of his being <hi rend="italic">so employed</hi>, and was surprised when his book was announced. We have not <hi rend="italic">since</hi> corresponded: on my recovering my copy (purchase) from L. &amp; B., <hi rend="italic">I just looked into it</hi>, but have never since opened it.</p>
         <p>I have not seen “the Criticism of that work by Arthur Atkinson” (mentioned by you), though I think I saw some brief notice of it in a Newspr. <hi rend="italic">Is it published</hi>?</p>
         <p>For nearly all ’92 I was invalided! scarcely able to do much at anything, owing to remains of that <hi rend="italic">fell </hi>influenza—or its 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. relapse—from Novr./91! I am, however, now very much better (having fought my way),—but <hi rend="italic">older</hi>, and I <hi rend="italic">feel </hi>old age increasingly.</p>
         <p>     Hope you are keeping right well. I am,</p>
         <p>                                                                             My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>                                                                                     Yours faithy.,</p>
         <p>                                                                                             W. Colenso.</p>
