         <p>The Hon.<lb/>The Colonial Secretary,<lb/>Wellington</p>
         <p>Sir</p>
         <p>I have the honor to inform you, that, having sent in a Petition and Letter (concerning my occupation of 10 acres of Land at Waitangi in Hawke’s Bay) to His Excellency the Governor on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. July last and having immediately received a kind answer from His Excellency informing me that “he had lost no time in forwarding the same for the consideration of his responsible Advisers;”—and, further, having also forwarded to His Excellency on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ulto., a Letter covering an open Letter from the early Settlers and Magistrates of Hawke’s Bay in support of my former Petition, and having, again, immediately received a similar answer from His Excellency, “assuring” me, that he “had lost no time in forwarding the same for the consideration of his responsible advisers:” (and now, Sir,—that we are about to separate, and I to return to Hawke’s Bay;) I beg that you will—with your coadjutors in the Ministry—be pleased to consider those Papers above referred to, and inform me of your decision thereupon.</p>
         <p>I feel the more necessitated to ask you, Sir, to acquaint me with your determination before we separate—from the fact of my having recently heard, from my Servant left in charge of Waitangi, of the side fence of my garden and orchard there having fallen—partly through strong winds &amp; winter weather, and partly through the large herds of Settlers’ Cattle continually rubbing against it; so that I must be prepared for an immediate outlay of from ₤20.—to ₤28.—to restore it.</p>
         <p>I believe, Sir, that you were well acquainted with the place during your residence in Hawke’s Bay, as well as with those respectable gentlemen &amp; magistrate who have supported my Petition.</p>
         <p>     Awaiting your answer<lb/>               I have the honour to be,<lb/>                           Sir,<lb/>               Your mo. ob. servt.<lb/>                        Wm. Colenso</p>
         <p rend="end">Wellington, Sept. 16th</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Memo.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The accompanying Letter was not sent on the day dated, because of your being so very busy,—now, however, House having been prorogued—steamers gone—&amp; Governor absent—I send it                   W.Colenso.</p>
