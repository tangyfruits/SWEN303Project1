         <p rend="end">Paihia, July 26, 1842</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs</p>
         <p>1. My last Letters to you were dated respectively April 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>., and 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.,/42; since which yours of Nov. 24/41 to us, have been received.—</p>
         <p>2. The Bishop of New Zealand, his chaplains, and all Missionaries have arrived here. His Lordship first landed at Auckland in the Thames; he subsequently came to this place, where he remained a fortnight; during which time he visited Waimate and Kerikeri Stations. Mrs. Selwyn having arrived, his Lordship left for the Thames, Port Nicholson, and other Colonial Settlements, taking Mr. Reay and others with him.—</p>
         <p>3. Enclosed in a small box, (which I have directed Messrs. Campbell to forward to you by the same ship which takes this thence to England,) are 100 Copies of the Bishop’s Sermon, which he preached both at Auckland and Paihia. It is <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, “Published at the request of the Congregation,” but it should be understood that only 3 persons so requested it, and two of those three I have since heard state, that “His Lordship will have, ere long, to alter his opinion from what he has therein advanced, when he shall have learned somewhat of the Native character.” I deem it necessary to mention this, as, from what the Bishop has said in his Sermon, persons at the distance of 16,000 miles may indeed be led to suppose, that this is not merely a land flowing with milk and honey, but really the very choicest portion of <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> heritage. To me, every thing appears “unwatered <hi rend="italic">still</hi> and dry”. Ordinances and externals of Religion abound, but to my perception ’tis the shell without the kernel. Nevertheless I would believe that there are a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> on whom the Spirit of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> has breathed; who are beginning to see things as they really are— “men as trees walking.” But the Word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, and my own experience have taught me, that a “<hi rend="italic">few</hi>” only do believe to the saving <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>of their Souls, even when Gospel Truth is plainly and fearlessly declared. In making these remarks, I would to prevent misconstruction, also add, that I have not the vanity to suppose that my <hi rend="italic">ipse dixit</hi> will be received in contradiction to the now published opinion of the Bishop. I cannot, however, refrain from giving you the honest convictions of my heart.—</p>
         <p>4. There is also in the Box, a copy of my late Travelling Journal, with a few Sketches stitched up with it. This I would thank you to deliver to my old and much-esteemed friend Mr. Broughton, who having read the same will have the goodness to send it to my cousin the Rev. J.W. Colenso, Harrow, who will forward it to Mrs. Garnon, the person for whom it was written. Of course you are quite welcome to make whatever use you please of the contents.</p>
         <p>5. You will also find a few copies of a little Tract, which I have lately published (as before at my own expense,) against the Roman Catholics. It is a Letter to the Natives informing them of the conversion of three Roman Catholic priests to the Protestant Faith, and of their reception into the Church of England; together with the “Form of Prayer” used on the occasion. I have enclosed therewith a liberal translation of the few sentences which I appended as an Introduction to the “Form of Prayer.” I am sorry, very sorry, that our Missionary Comee., have neither done, nor countenanced the doing of any thing in the shape of Tracts against those artful emissaries of Evil. And, I think I may say, that I have reason to suppose, that less <hi rend="italic">should </hi>be done in that way by any one belonging to your Society in this land, who wishes to live in peace with those who are either above or co-workers with him. It is useless, however, for any person or persons to suppose that he or they will ever be able to induce me to cease positively opposing as opportunity <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>may offer these Servants of Rome. Yea, any one, whoever he may be, who shall attempt to preach another Gospel to the poor New Zealanders, than Glad tidings for perishing Sinners through the peace-seeking blood and merits of our glorified Redeemer, or attempt to lay any other foundation than that which is <hi rend="italic">laid</hi>, even Jesus Christ, will necessarily be opposed by me. I trust that <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> will give me wisdom to discern, and faithfulness to expose, </p>
         <p>the stealthy approaches towards error, so warily made in first beginnings; as well as all the requisite caution which I may need, to keep me within the bounds of moderation.</p>
         <p>5. There is also a Copy of the Psalter prepared for Press; concerning which the Comee. of Missionaries have been pleased to adopt a proposition of mine requesting you to get 10,000 Copies printed; as our edition of 5,000 have all been issued. I suppose that it quite escaped their notice to desire the “Order for Administering the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Supper”, to be printed with it. I, however, venture to think it highly requisite, inasmuch as the number of Communicants are numerous and still increasing. I have, therefore, added a Copy of the Communion Service, which you will get printed and bound with it, or not, at your discretion. In either case <hi rend="italic">I should be happy to have 500 Copies, (in addition) on my own private account.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>6. I have also sent you Part 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. of a “Grammar of the New Zealand Language,” by Mr. Maunsell; which, while it contains much that is excellent, is far from being entirely correct.</p>
         <p>7. Our new Printing Press has safely arrived, and is put up in the Printing Office. We want, however, some one to work it, and some one also, to get matter ready for it. At present, and for some time past we have been busily employed with Reprints of the Small Prayer Book, Primus, Catechisms, &amp;c.; parts of Exodus and Deuteronomy; and sundry Documents for the Bishop.<hi rend="bold">[4]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>8. I have also enclosed in the Box, a small Indent, including Articles for the Printing Office and on private account of self and friends; which you will oblige us in getting forwarded by earliest opportunity. I think it needful to say, in order to prevent any degree of astonishment arising in your minds at my writing for a few stores so soon after the arrival of such a large shipment as that pr. “William Wise,” that, although those stores were all immediately divided among the different Individuals of the Mission, I did not obtain a single article: hence the cause of my now writing for a small supply.</p>
         <p>10. I have been given to understand that I am to have a Dictionary of the New Zealand language by the Rev. W. Williams to print. Although, at first reading of the Resolution in Comee., the Comee. of Missionaries rejected the same, at a subsequent Comee. it was again urged and adopted. I have represented—the time it will take to execute it here; the hindrance it will be to other (and much more useful) works intended for the benefit of the Natives; the expense it will put the Society to, with little prospect of a return of the same; the certainty that if printed in England it would be ready for delivery in less time and at a much less expense than if printed here; the probability that, if, when printed here, it should be considered an article worth speculating in; persons would be found to get it cheaply reprinted in England or America, and so undersell our edition; and the almost certainty, that if handed over to the New Zealand Land Company (now that the way is opened) they would not only gladly print it, but also remunerate Mr. Williams (or the Society) for the copy-right;—but to no purpose. A Dictionary of the New Zealand language is merely a Book of reference for the <hi rend="italic">few</hi>; for, instead of the Settlers caring to learn “Maori,” they have already shewn that the Natives in order to carry on any dealings with them, will have to pick up some smattering of English, and such knowledge the present (and, I fear, the next in succession) race of New Zealanders <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>will never gain from Books. I am sorry, my dear Sirs, indeed I am, to have to remain with the press to do such (permit me to say) very un-missionary work. I felt the restraint great, when I was closely engaged in working in the Printing Office for the spiritual benefit of the Natives; how much more then may it not be supposed I feel my present and prospective situation, when obliged to execute such work?</p>
         <p>10. With the utmost deference, my dear Sirs, I pray you to allow me to hope, that par.4, of my Letter to you of Jany. 24/40, will receive from the Parent Comee. every kind consideration. I trust, that from my present anomalous situation I shall not be brought into juxta-position with his Lordship the Bishop. I <hi rend="italic">can</hi>—through <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> grace which is covenanted—endure poverty, and, like the Apostles, not only consent but rejoice to be counted the offscouring of all things, so that I preach the Gospel; but I never, never can consent to cease declaring to others that blessed Gospel which the Spirit of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> (notwithstanding my dullness) has made me in some measure to comprehend.</p>
         <p>11. You will, doubtless, hear from others (to whose province it more particularly belongs,) of the present state of things in New Zealand. The Thames and Bay of Plenty Natives are again in a very unsettled condition, owing to a number of the former having made an irruption on the Tauranga Natives and killed seven, while peaceably engaged in planting. The latter have since retaliated, and killed some of the other party; and it is probable that other Tribes, at least those residing in the immediate neighbourhood, will become involved.</p>
         <p>12. I mentioned in my last of a disastrous fire having taken place at Auckland, by which several of the Governt. Offices were consumed. Shortly after that event, the Governor’s late residence at Russell in the Bay, (one of the first class houses <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>in New Zealand,) was totally destroyed by fire. Lieut. Beckham, J.P., who occupied it, barely escaping in his shirt. And, about a fortnight ago, the residence of the late Additional British Resident, Lieut. McDonnel, at Hokianga, was also burnt to the ground; the property destroyed, in the last-mentioned fire, is stated as valued at £5,000. I mention these events in order to notice an opinion which is abroad, that there is something more in the consecutive happening of these fires than mere casualty. The Government, unfortunately, is much disliked. I believe Capt. Hobson to be a well-meaning man, but, unhappily, he has those about him who appear to be very bad advisers; and, in connection with them, such a number of dependent place-hunters to be provided for, as actually to eat up all—and more than all—the energies of the Colony can produce. For, in addition to the immense sums realised from the sale of petty sections of Land at Auckland, a debt is already announced, exceeding £50,000! I, however, merely mention this, that you may hear, though briefly, the common report of the Colony, for I have neither time <hi rend="italic">nor inclination</hi>, to meddle with politics.—</p>
         <p>May the Lord of His infinite mercy graciously be pleased to overrule all events for the good of His Church—to direct those who are in Authority in this Colony for His glory and the welfare of the people—to guide us into truth, and, having stablished, finmally to receive us into His Heavenly Kingdom!</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>my dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>Ever most truly yours</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I have written Berdoe a Letter, in which I have ordered the Clothing mentioned in the Indent, (in the Box,) and, <hi rend="italic">I believe that I am not indebted a penny at this time on the Secretary’s Books.</hi>
         </p>
