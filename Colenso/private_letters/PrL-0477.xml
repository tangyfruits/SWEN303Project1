         <p>Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>At length I send you my last little lot of 2 read Papers:—I did both hope and intend to have done so much earlier, but I was sadly hindered by the wet weather in Novr. &amp; Decr., particularly when at “70 m. Bush” <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ-</hi>hunting!—wishing to find fruiting specimens. I found, however, what I was in quest of: also, a few novelties, of which more anon.</p>
         <p>With the 2 papers I also send an abstract of our <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for 1881: the <hi rend="italic">List</hi> of Members I will send you early in Feby., in a <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> form,—so as to have no mistakes in their names.—</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">specimens</hi> of shells &amp; plants, I cannot find time to put up and send to you by <hi rend="italic">this </hi>Mail, but I will very soon—perhaps next week—I have them here for you.</p>
         <p>I suppose you received the <hi rend="italic">2 teeth</hi> I sent you?” not having heard from you since, I have feared they were of no great value.</p>
         <p>Writing at this season I wish you all its good complimentary wishes: and hoping you are well</p>
         <p>I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
