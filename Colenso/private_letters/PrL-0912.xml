         <p>Dear Mrs. Hill</p>
         <p>Many A1 thanks for your kind and esteemed remembrance of me—in your valued note of yesterday,—it seemed to strike afresh a chord in my heart to know that the wife of my good friend—in the midst of her many duties, domestic &amp; social—found time to write to this old man—long so solitary, and now so very near the brink of separation! I too, when in the Synod, looked to see if you were among the few ladies who were present, (as I knew from Mr. Hill that you were there at the opening,) but could not identify you.—</p>
         <p>I have been closely engaged writing to England by this S.F. Mail, and have once more concluded. I trust Mr. Hill has fair weather at Wairoa, and will be able to return to us “without let or hindrance” of any kind when he has finished his work there.</p>
         <p>I note with pleasure what you so kindly say repecting my promised visit to Bluff Hill when Mr. Hill returns,—and this I shall willingly endeavour to do. I think we may soon reasonably look for settled fine weather for a season,—that and a moonlight night to enable me to walk back of an evening would suit me very well—as I can walk farther and longer now that I could last year.——–</p>
         <p>Trusting you and your family are quite well, and with kind regards. Believe me</p>
         <p>   Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                                           W. Colenso.</p>
