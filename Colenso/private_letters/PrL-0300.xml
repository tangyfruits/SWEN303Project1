         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Novr 12  1875</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>As I am writing to you offy., <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the Geologl. Maps, I just add this.—</p>
         <p>I am not sure but that I ought also to address you offy.,—if so, pray forgive me.—</p>
         <p>It is to enquire about the <hi rend="italic">copies</hi> of the Trans. of the Instit. 1874, for <hi rend="underline italic">our</hi> Members,—If such will shortly be forwarded? A month ago I received a copy of the same, (as <hi rend="italic">a Member</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Wgn. </hi>Branch,)—and this prompts the enquiry.</p>
         <p>Further: I don’t know that I need to say any thing more in reply to your 2 telegrams of Novr. 3 &amp; 4, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the election of a Hony. Member, than I have already said in my brief telegraphic reply. I was very unwell at the time, and still am,—slowly recovering (?) from a severe &amp; long attack of Bronchitis, which completely floored &amp; almost carried me off! I noticed in your telegram you said, “such election is to take place in <hi rend="italic">October</hi>,”—but, as I read the by-law, it should be in <hi rend="italic">Novr.</hi>—however I may be wrong.</p>
         <p>Did you see the <hi rend="italic">resumé</hi>, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the unfortunate Maori Lexn., I wrote &amp; sent in July for the Members of the G.A.? that they might <hi rend="italic">clearly</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">know</hi> how matters stood. Your <hi rend="italic">name</hi> &amp; initiation of that matter were prominently stated. That paper should have been in Members’ hands,—and I fear it is not even now printed!!</p>
         <p>What about the reprinting of the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. vol. of Transactions? Dr. Hector wrote to me, asking, if I wished to correct my Papers in it?—In reply I wished to know, whether the copious &amp; interesting (yet necessary) <hi rend="italic">notes</hi>, which I had sent with the original Ms. (&amp; <hi rend="italic">again</hi> to Dr. Hector, on his informing me he had mislaid them) could not be added thereto?—But to this I never obtained any answer. I believe that Dr. Hector was absent, S., at the time. Could you tell me anything about it?</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well.</p>
         <p>I am, my Dr. Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
