         <p rend="end">Napier July 3/76</p>
         <p>W. Rathbone, Esq.,</p>
         <p>Dr. Sir</p>
         <p>Mr Luff (late of this town) sent a consignment of stationery, 7 cases per “Madeleine” to Messrs. Dinwiddie &amp; Co. Unfortunately they, being well-stocked in those goods, do not want them and so Mr Luff has written to me to offer them in one lot here in H. Bay before I send them to another Province. Therefore I write to you.</p>
         <p>The whole amount of Invoice (including expenses to Napier) viz ₤150. I am informed by Mr. Dinwiddie that the goods are uncommonly cheap: this I should have supposed,—and suitable too, or Mr Luff would not have secured &amp; sent them out. Mr. Dinwiddie is willing to open the lot &amp; take what they may require,—but this is wholly beyond my instructions.</p>
         <p>I may mention the Invoice contains, among other articles, the following—</p>
         <p>100 Reams large cream laid note</p>
         <p>&amp;c       &amp;c  &amp;c</p>
         <p>&amp;c       &amp;c  &amp;c</p>
         <p>An <hi rend="italic">early </hi>answer will oblige</p>
         <p>     I am</p>
         <p>             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                     (sgd.) W. Colenso</p>
         <p>(A copy also sent to Graham &amp; Co. of Gisborne—W.C.)</p>
