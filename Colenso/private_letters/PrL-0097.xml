         <p>Tuesday noon</p>
         <p>D. McLean Esq</p>
         <p>&amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I am indeed much obliged to you for your kind forwarding my letters &amp;c by your lad.—</p>
         <p>But I have not any particular news—save that Gov. Grey &amp; Lady were at Port Nicholson, and Archd. Williams had sailed from England. Archd. Hadfield too had a severe fall from his horse but was better.</p>
         <p>I now send you a native almanac—I have but 100 for the whole Dist!</p>
         <p>We send you a little Milk and would send you an Apple Pie, but, alas! we have no Lard nor Butter wherewith to make the Crust. This Mrs Colenso regrets. Would you like any <hi rend="italic">green </hi>apples for cooking? i.e. the <hi rend="italic">thinnings </hi>of the Trees.—</p>
         <p>The day you left a <hi rend="italic">taua </hi>of ducks—11 in number—gobbled up <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the remaining gooseberries!</p>
         <p>You will further oblige me in letting me know the day on which the Rose sails. I have hopes of being in time for the ship for England; although Cole says I must <hi rend="italic">not </hi>be behind Feby. 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Pray excuse this, and</p>
         <p>               Believe me</p>
         <p>                       Ever yours truly</p>
         <p>                               W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. <hi rend="italic">The </hi>“Black Cow” has been driven out nearly 10 times from the natives’ kumara &amp; potatoes for which she seems to have taken quite a fancy. I have <hi rend="italic">heard </hi>shooting her proposed. W.C.</p>
