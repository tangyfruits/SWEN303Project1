         <p>The Secretaries<lb/>C.M. House,<lb/>Salisbury Square,<lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>1. My last Letter to you was dated September 17/41, since which I have been permitted to make a journey to the Natives residing in <hi rend="italic">Wangarei</hi> Bay and villages adjacent. And am now about leaving the Station on a visit to the Natives residing at the East Cape, and other places in the large parish of the Revd. William Williams; and so fulfil a promise made by me unto those Natives some time ago.</p>
         <p>2.–Through the blessing of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> on my labours, I have been enabled to finish the printing of the Prayer Book—(a few copies of which I send you by the vessel which takes this to England,)—it has been a long while, indeed, in crawling through the Press, but, when all the labour whereof, from the translating to the striking-off, is duly considered, and, that much, too, of that labour has devolved on myself, I venture to think that it will be pretty evident, that no time has been lost in the getting it out. Of this Book, the greater number of the Collects were translated by the Rev. William Williams: The Sacramental and Matrimonial Services by Mr Puckey: and the remaining Collects, with the epistles from the Old Testamnet, Thanksgivings and Prayers, Communion of Sick, visitation of ditto, Commination, Rubrics, and Articles of Religion, by myself. The last, alone, required much time and considerable and close attention in Translating, Correcting, Revising and Re-revising, ere they became what they now are. Thankful and humble, however, I would be, in reviewing the goodness of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> towards <hi rend="underline italic">me</hi>! “Who am I, and what my Father’s house?” and, “Whence is this to me?” I often ask. When I landed in New Zealand, nearly seven years ago, I often besought the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> in prayer, to grant me health, strength, and ability to print the New Testament and Prayer Book: He has been pleased to hear and answer my request—and now, what remains? He also knows! <hi rend="italic">This </hi>is my natal day, (a solemn day to me) and I may not see another here! Oh! for grace to say continually, in and under <hi rend="italic">all </hi>circumstances, “Good is the will of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>.”—</p>
         <p>3. I, also, send you copies of the Almanack for 1842, which I have been enabled to calculate and prepare; a portion of Isaiah, translated by Revd. R. Maunsell; and a few copies of a prayer used here for the Governor. We are <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>now proceeding with the printing of the <hi rend="italic">Exodus</hi>; and have to commence directly the reprinting of the <hi rend="italic">small </hi>Prayer Books, Primer, and Catechisms, our large editions of each being all Issued.—</p>
         <p>4. The Paper, and other stores, pr. “William Wise,” have just arrived, all in good condition. We were using the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of our Demy when the Brig came in!</p>
         <p>5. On my return from Wangarei, I found that the Roman Catholic Priest had given Revd. H. Williams a challenge to a Public Discussion, to take place at <hi rend="italic">Kororareka </hi>in the New Zealand language; which Mr. Williams accepted. The Discussion took place on the Tuesday and Wednesday, the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ult., on the one side, were the four Roman Catholic Priests, on the other, were Mr Williams and myself. I assure you, my dear Sirs, I went to the field with much fear and trembling,—not, as to the ultimate result—but as to my own incapacity and utter unworthiness for such a situation. <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, however, graciously strengthened us, and we were more than conquerors through the Testimony of Jesus! I could scarcely have considered it possible for men holding ministerial offices in a <hi rend="italic">professing</hi> Christian Church to be so very ignorant of Scripture—or, that such men could possibly prevaricate in the manner these did. <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> enabled us, not only to beat down all their arguments with the plain words of Scripture, but, also, to preach to them the Truth as it is in Jesus. I could but fancy that I plainly saw the same Spirit, which has always so manifested itself in many of their unhappy Church against our Reforming Forefathers! They hesitated not to affirm, over and over, that our New Zealand Testament was all false! being not the word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, but merely words of our own!! One solitary text of Scripture was all they brought forward during the whole of the first day’s discussion; and this was done to defend their Image-worship, &amp;c, namely, <hi rend="italic">Joshua VII. 6</hi>. They laboured most assiduously, to get us to quit the taking up the plain word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, but they could not succeed. Unhappy men! they found, I am sure, on some occasions, that the sword of the spirit was two-edged. Had I leisure, I should much like to give you an outline of the meeting, from my Notes and other Memoranda, but, really, have not time to do so. It grieved me much, however, to hear them tell the Natives <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>with a triumphant air of assurance, that, by their latest Letters England was again returning to her right mind and to the only true Faith and Church! and that “Pusey, a great Doctor among them, is the great instrument employed by the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> in this matter”!! Oh! how is the fine gold become dim! how is the faithful city become a harlot! I do not think they will beat all desirous of encountering us again, for some time at least; and would fain hope, that both good to the Natives and glory to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> may arise from this meeting. It has, in a measure, opened the eyes of the Protestant community to what the Romanists really are; and has caused many of the former to become exceedingly dissatisfied with the latter.—</p>
         <p>6. I enclose, in the small parcel of Books, Notes of my late visit to Wangarei; which I would thank you, my dear Sirs, to pass on to my Father at Penzance; as I have not time to make a copy of the same.</p>
         <p>7. The Natives are, in general, pretty tranquil throughout the Island; and the different members of the Mission enjoy good health. His Lordship the Bishop of New Zealand, whose arrival has been for a considerable time expected, has not yet arrived. The Land Commissioners are pursuing the investigation of Claims to Land, and have several knotty cases to unravel: I fear it will be no easy matter for them to do justioce to <hi rend="italic">all </hi>parties. A proclamation has just been issued to restrain persons from cutting Pine Timber, which has given great dissatisfaction.—Mr Burrows is still residing at Kororareka. The Columbine has not yet been offered for sale. In fact, <hi rend="italic">another </hi>vessel is spoken of as about being purchased!</p>
         <p>Praying that the Lord may ever more guide and direct us,</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>Yours most truly &amp; obediently</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
