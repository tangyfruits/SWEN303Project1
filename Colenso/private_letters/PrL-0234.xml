         <p rend="end">June, 1868</p>
         <p rend="end">Tuesday mg.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I scarcely know how to thank you for all your kind remembrances of me with Newspapers—knowing too (as I do) how valuable your time is, and how much occupied of late—bearing in mind that <hi rend="italic">you take the field today</hi>!—</p>
         <p>I now return them with many thanks.—</p>
         <p>I did greatly wish to see Dr. F’s. address; I knew you had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> got it—ditto Athenæum: ditto Routledge and Kennedy:—somehow, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> seem to have been neglected!</p>
         <p>So, last evening, I went to Catchpool—from whom I got a file of “Independents”—and was just got deep into the Dr’s speech—when your kind missive arrived.—</p>
         <p>I see he still harps upon his everlasting string of H. Bay interest £2500 per ann.—a nice picking (as things are!) for him: Dr. Fn. can speak feelingly as to “the act of spoliation” (<hi rend="italic">in re</hi> Marlborough)—he seems to <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> that <hi rend="italic">such</hi> cuts <hi rend="italic">both</hi> ways; and that we feel it in this— “interest”! When I was in the Ho. (I think in ’62) I had thought of bringing it before the Assembly (in some shape), of how much of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Duties were then—&amp; for years—swallowed up by Wellington—and I should assuredly have done it but for Dr. Knight to whom I mentioned it and who recommended me to wait, as the Govt, knew of it, &amp; intended doing something,—&amp; that he would not lose sight of it &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I am <hi rend="italic">right glad</hi> Fitz. has done so much in England:—glad too, for Stafford’s sake (who has been sadly hounded of late,—the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> story,)—I have little doubt but that what Stafford told the Nelson folks will prove true—in spite of all the N.Z. Press says.</p>
         <p>If you have not read Rolleston’s speech (on being elected Suptdt.) do so;—ditto Stevens’ Letter on Finance; and “<hi rend="italic">Dunedin’s</hi>” Jesuitical letter:—I hope this man will <hi rend="italic">never</hi> come to Otago.</p>
         <p>I see, you are to commence today, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> your old aid-de-camp (Ormond)! You may say “There is precious little now to fight about,” or,—well, I won’t trouble you with any more <hi rend="italic">stray</hi> thoughts.</p>
         <p>I much wished that Wilson had finished that Deed—(W’s office is just a little Chancery.) I have been to him 2 or 3 times, but don’t intend to go again until <hi rend="italic">Council is over</hi>: leave it till then.<hi rend="bold"> </hi>
         </p>
         <p>But do let <hi rend="italic">the other matter</hi> (the 2 sections on inner harbour) be <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> in your Ex. before you again break up: it has been left too long already.</p>
         <p>Wishing you well through this mo. of June—and hoping your meeting will be productive of great good to our Prov. I am, my Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>     truly yours, W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
