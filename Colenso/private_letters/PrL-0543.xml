         <p rend="end">Napier, August 26/83.<lb/>(night)</p>
         <p>A. Luff Esq.,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Your kind welcome letter of 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. I received last night: I thank you for it very much. Your letters always remind me of <hi rend="italic">old</hi> times, when I had the pleasure of seeing you here (as well as in town) and of hearing your voice. Those days are fled! and will never return—nor others like to them!—</p>
         <p>I feel inclined to write you in reply <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi>, for I shall be busy next week (&amp; week after, too, indeed always busy—that is, in my way) and if I were to put it off I might neglect it altogether. I purpose going inland—as far as ’Pukurau—on Tuesday, but do not intend to be absent longer than 2 or 3 days.</p>
         <p>First then I am glad that you were all quite well—or nearly so. Our Spring, as you say, has set in—though I fancy 2 days after you wrote your letter (Friday last, 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.) it was wintry enough with you! Here it was cold, with rattling hail showers at intervals; snow on the low-lying hills, and on the big ’un on Couper’s Run: yesterday it was fine, and this afternoon delightful, though this morning it was windy.</p>
         <p>I thank you for what you have told me <hi rend="italic">re</hi> what you saw in the Evg. Mail—I will look out for it. A short time ago a gentleman (almost a stranger) kindly came up to tell me what he had seen in the Lyttelton Times (of last month) copied from “Nature” (Eng. serial) respecting me.<note xml:id="ftn3-195" place="foot" n="195"> Scientific worthies. Nature 1883. 27, 597–601 (26 April).</note> And, as I am on the subject of newspapers I may mention that a friend inland sent me a “Wellington Times” to read &amp; return—it contained T.C. Williams’ long, long story with a map: at that time <hi rend="italic">I made sure you would send me a copy</hi>, and so I did not then write to ask you to do so; but I don’t want it now.—Had you patience to read it?</p>
         <p>Again re Papers: I have often asked Do you see our Dy. Telegraph? Grubb told me (some time back) that you took in the “Herald”: is this correct? The “Dy. Telegraph” is got wonderfully ahead of the “H.”, and is a far better got up paper—as to manner of work &amp;c. I am afraid the “H.” will become still lower; as that McDougall (long their “own correspondent” from Waipawa) is going to join their “staff” next month: I hear that P. Dinw. is much against it, but Walker will have it so.—</p>
         <p>In your getting the “Herald” you will have seen all about our Harbour Board, &amp; Harbour design &amp; Judges’ opinion anent the same.—And, also, <hi rend="italic">the prices</hi> that ¼ ac. sections at Hastings brought at auction last week!—–</p>
         <p>I am half-inclined to believe with some of your Politicians that we are running much too fast into debt. How our Drapers manage to eke out a living—in the face of so much continued opposition coming-in from outside—I don’t know. Folks in town complain of the dulness of trade: money too, is scarce.—</p>
         <p>Mr. Grubb is, as you say, <hi rend="italic">very</hi> busy: he is always so! I see but very little of him &amp; that only now and then, when I happen to fall in with him <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> his establishment—for a few seconds.</p>
         <p>Mr. Sidey is fitting-up at a great expense (apparently) the Old Girls School, next to Tiffen’s: S. is going to reside there—I am told.—</p>
         <p>The Lambing had commenced inland a fort­night back, and, at first, everything was prosperous: one wrote to me saying his were <hi rend="italic">over</hi> 100%: I fear the bitter day of Friday may have done mischief.</p>
         <p>Our 2 wkly. steamers (both N. &amp; S.) arrived here <hi rend="italic">today</hi>—so I don’t know what letters may have come by them—shall not until tomorrow.—</p>
         <p>I suppose you saw in the N. papers of Lyndon’s auction at Waipawa? The piece of land sold was that on which Abbott’s <hi rend="italic">old original</hi> house stands. Robb bought it for over ₤500.—J.D.O. has just bought Georgy Richardson’s house (over on the hill near Cemetery) for ₤2000. &amp; is getting it enlarged: so I suppose I may expect a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> neighbour shortly.—</p>
         <p>Did I tell you that Sealy is coming back again!—</p>
         <p>Old as I am, if I could but stand the sea-voyage, (I mean, &amp; <hi rend="italic">no</hi> sickness,) I would return to E.</p>
         <p>I am however well:—though sometimes at nights <hi rend="italic">after I am in bed</hi>, have a <hi rend="italic">great deal</hi> of unpleasant dry coughing. I attribute it to the sudden change of temperature.—</p>
         <p>I note what you say <hi rend="italic">re</hi> that handsome fern <hi rend="italic">Gl. Cunninghamii </hi>(hope you have seen it in its glory &amp; beauty, 3 tiers of whorls!) Shall be very glad to receive any specimens from your son.<note xml:id="ftn3-196" place="foot" n="196"> Andrew Luff’s sons were Henry Channon Luff, architect, and George Andrew Middlemiss Luff, civil engineer, educated at Dulwich College while the family was in London.</note> You <hi rend="italic">please me much</hi> in telling me of his doing his work <hi rend="italic">well</hi>—<hi rend="italic">correctly</hi>: good. You &amp; I have seen &amp; known a little of that old incompetent work done here,—which has given us (but since you left) so much trouble.</p>
         <p>You will have seen that the scheme planned for to secure a successor to Mr. Sidey has failed: much to the discontent of some of the “good” Scotch here: I told Craig that I thought his countrymen down S. were in the right of it: and I twitted <hi rend="italic">him </hi>(he having had a great deal to do in the matter),—with his (&amp; their) reading backwards of both the Old &amp; New Commandments: “Thou shalt not covet”: &amp; “Do unto others as” &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Fannin is keeping very well: his poor wife is again unwell.</p>
         <p>If you can obtain me a few seeds (new &amp; mature) of the “Chatham Islands Lily,” I would thank you.</p>
         <p>My <hi rend="italic">big</hi> Acacias (&amp; several other trees) are dying through this wretched large imported blight! it is a dreadful thing! &amp; doing great mischief every where.—</p>
         <p>By this day month, or so, I hope to make my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> visit to the Woods, but only a short one.</p>
         <p>With very kind regards. Bel. me,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Last week I recd. a kind note from Willis, in reply to mine, &amp; yesterday I sent him his copy “Trans.”</p>
         <p>P.S. Hope you will remember the old adage, “Once bit, twice shy”—and so give a wide berth to Gold Field Specs.</p>
