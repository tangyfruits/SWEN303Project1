         <p>Mr. Wm. Gordon,<lb/>New Plymouth.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have been very much pleased in looking over the photo. you kindly sent me containing specimens of Maori ornament, carving, drawings, &amp;c., as given in the borders around the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> prayer in Maori. I have frequently taken it up and admired it; your printed descriptive paper of it is also good” I would it were longer and complete. Among the pleasing natural Maori terms for their specific ornaments, I would particularly mention the Rengarenga, (the so-called N.Z. lily = <hi rend="italic">Arthropodium cirrhatum</hi>,) whose symmetrically curled anthers gave the scrutinizing intelligent Maori the idea and the name. It is pleasing to note that Dr. Forster (the European Botanist who visited New Zealand with Cook on his second Voyage,) was also struck with the peculiar beauty of the anthers of this plant, so that, in his scientifically describing it, he fixed on that character for its specific name.—(See note to my paper respecting it, “Transactions N.Z. Institute”, vol. XXIV. p.460.)—</p>
         <p>Again thanking you and heartily wishing you all success in your highly commendable labours of preserving the numerous patterns of carving and of stenciling used by the ancient Maoris, I am,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
