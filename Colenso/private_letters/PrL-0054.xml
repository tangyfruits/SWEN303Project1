         <p>Friend, Wereta, Greeting to thee. </p>
         <p>This indeed is my word to thee. I am come to this place, notwithstanding I said to thee at Huariki, that I should go by the coast to Te Kopi. Lo! This is the reason why I have changed my route to the inland one—that some of the people of this place may go on with me to Te Kopi to partake of the Holy Supper there, which Mr. Cole &amp; myself will administer. Now, I write this to thee that thou mayst know the true reason why I changed my route, lest thou shouldest think I don’t know what. Now, after two Sundays have elapsed I shall perhaps arrive at Pahawa, the Wednesday or the Thursday will be the day for me to arrive at Pahawa. I shall sleep there, and in the morning &amp; shall proceed on, northwards. If you call &amp; welcome me to your place I will enter in; if not I shall go right on by the Coast: this is my plan for my journey. O Friend, I am mourning concerning thee; I am praying for thee; but perhaps, thou wilt not mourn for thyself. Friend, look thou at my words; consider them;—Do thou search for the road to the City,—Still perhaps is open the gracious door of heaven. Let not thy considerations be turned aside by any Native who may imagine any false or vain thing. </p>
         <p>þs, My letter to Wereta, <lb/>From me, Colenso.</p>
