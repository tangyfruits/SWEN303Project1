         <p rend="end">July 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> 1880</p>
         <p>Mr Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I received your kind, full, &amp; welcome note of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> on Wednesday—I thank you for it, chq enclosed all safe.</p>
         <p>I should not write you this mail leaving tomorrow for P.T., were it not—that by dint of extra exertion—I have put up your parcel this eve­ning by candle light—containing your 2 Vols of Hand Book N.Z. Flora and Vol XII of Transactions—the first lot of them (58 Vols in a thump­ing heavy box) only arriving here this evening—and I have lost no time, made <hi rend="italic">one</hi> parcel, &amp; directed as you requested—tomorrow my man will take it to Harvey Rymers man; I have paid carriage to P.Tapu.</p>
         <p>Now a word about your 2 Vols. You did right in choosing the Bound ones—these are strongly bound, as you will see,—they were bound by Dinwiddie here for us, under my supervision, &amp; we have used them a wee bit at our meetings, but they are <hi rend="italic">not at all the worse for that</hi> as you will see. In them you have also an extra list of the <hi rend="italic">Maori</hi> names of the plants (many of them) which I had got from Dr Hector. The only rea­son of our parting with them, &amp; retaining instead the one bound in Eng­land is, that the Eng bound agree in appearance in everything with the <hi rend="italic">similar</hi> books bound there by same binder, thats all.</p>
         <p>Dinwiddies charge for <hi rend="italic">binding</hi>-only, was 7/- per Vol—only I had beat him down to 6/- each on his binding a large lot for us.</p>
         <p>I have no time for more. Have not yet looked inside these new fellows; folks in town (members) wanting their copies badly. My man takes ½ doz round tonight.</p>
         <p>And regards to your good wife—Hope you are all well.</p>
         <p>     Yours truly <lb/>               W. Colenso.</p>
