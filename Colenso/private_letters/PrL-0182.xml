         <p rend="end">Napier, Jany. 4/65</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Heartily wishing you the compliments of the season—I have to thank you for your letter of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ulto.—recd. by me <hi rend="italic">here</hi> a day or two after my return last week—</p>
         <p>I am gratified in hearing that <hi rend="italic">you have been so in going over the Books </hi>I forwarded; and in knowing, that, as far as you had then opened, the things I sent were <hi rend="italic">safe</hi>, &amp;c. You have done right in getting a good Case made, which I shall settle with you for promptly when your account for that &amp; other matters is rendered.—</p>
         <p>I have commenced working for you—again—and shall do my best: I was rather disappointed in not <hi rend="italic">ferretting </hi>out more useful statistical information from the <hi rend="italic">Nat. </hi>Depart. at Auckland.</p>
         <p>I shall try to send you, by this Steamer, a parcel of nuts, <hi rend="italic">valuable </hi>in <hi rend="italic">commerce</hi> from our S. Sea Islands. I have seen a Letter from Price’s Belmont Candle Co. London, wishing much for the oil, &amp; saying, it is of <hi rend="italic">more</hi> value in the market (&amp; to them) than almost any other veg. oil. Supposing you may not have any of these nuts in your exhibition, I secured these at Auckland, (a few I gave Sir G. Grey,) and exhibition over, you can divide them between yourselves Canterbury &amp; Nelson—they may grow in the Bot. Gardens. The foliage of the tree is very peculiar being large white &amp; downy on <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> surface!—</p>
         <p>I have just got (by post) a Copy of Hooker’s N.Z. Hand-Book, part <hi rend="italic">I.</hi>—and I have been diving into it a little. Speaking <hi rend="italic">confidentially</hi> to you, I am vexed &amp; pleased—a kind of bitter sweet sensation! <hi rend="italic">pleased</hi> at seeing so many <hi rend="italic">sp. </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">gen. novæ </hi>from Mid. Island (mainly of your &amp; Haast’s collecting)—&amp; also at my old friend having <hi rend="italic">at last </hi>given way—in the matter of several of my plants—Phormium,—Aciphylla,—Librocedrus (Thuja),—Veronica—Thelymitra—Coprosma—Coriaria—Gentian, &amp;c &amp;c—(which, howr., he ought to have done nearly 20 years ago—or more, for some!) but <hi rend="italic">vexed</hi> at more displays of his synthetic vein, (helped, no doubt, by Bentham.)—You will see a great no. of valid species—<hi rend="italic">which appeared too as such in his Fl.Nov.Zel.</hi>—now looped up as <hi rend="italic">one</hi> sp. and some <hi rend="italic">gen</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">i.e. </hi>Ferns)—Polypodium Grammitis Nipholobus, &amp;c., all made into <hi rend="italic">one</hi> genus! this, I observe, Sir William has just done in his <hi rend="italic">Species Filicum</hi>—while Moore (in his <hi rend="italic">Index Filicum</hi>) has made lots of <hi rend="italic">gen. </hi>nov<hi rend="italic">.—</hi>seemg. to glory in having as many gen. as species—&amp;, curiously enough, all these <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Works have come to me by same Mail; so that a person is utterly confounded at this disagreement of our <hi rend="italic">Doctors</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I have not had time to go <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> into the Hand Book, (besides my larger wk. is w. you.)—I hope you too may have a copy: I know of 100 being shipped by “<hi rend="italic">Motueka</hi>” (or some such named ship) for N. Zealand. I am pleased to find <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had found &amp; sent to Dr. Hooker some of the same plants I had found here (<hi rend="italic">N</hi>. Isld.)—which, no doubt, was a means towards bringing him over:—and <hi rend="italic">very much pleased</hi> at your telling him you had detected a <hi rend="underline italic">3</hi>
            <hi rend="sup underline italic">rd</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">.</hi> sp. of <hi rend="italic">Phormium. </hi>I see he has altered our <hi rend="italic">Laurelia </hi>to the Tasm. gen. <hi rend="italic">Atherosperma </hi>and so confirming my opinion in my essay—as to their scarcely being distinct—also, yielding the <hi rend="underline italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup underline italic">nd</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">.</hi> sp. of (<hi rend="italic">Thuja</hi>)—now <hi rend="italic">Librocedrus</hi>—as I had therein said.</p>
         <p>But, anon:—your grand day is fast approaching. I hope you will have fine w.—the Governor—good attendance—all in Order within—<hi rend="italic">all you can possibly wish, </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">&amp; give great satisfaction</hi>: &amp; be <hi rend="italic">pleased</hi> yourself.</p>
         <p>Believe me, I shall <hi rend="italic">keep the day</hi>, here; &amp; be with you in spirit, &amp; dream at nights.</p>
         <p>—Ever my dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I have already written Hooker; promising my new <hi rend="italic">Crypts</hi>. after I have finished the essay. Not a word from him about the <hi rend="italic">Bell. </hi>Inscriptn.</p>
         <p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. P.S. I enclose a <hi rend="italic">label</hi>—for some large common glass bottles holding the nuts sent.—</p>
         <p>P.S. 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>.!! It has just occurred to me to say, that if you should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have a copy of Hooker’s Hd. Bk. &amp; wish to see it—let me know and I will gladly forward it by <hi rend="italic">Mail. </hi>W.C.</p>
