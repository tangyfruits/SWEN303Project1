         <p rend="end">Thursday night<lb/>Octr. 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>Mr R.C. Harding,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your kind note of this day is just to hand, (9 pm) and although I have just made a memo. to call on you on Saty. mg., (or, failing then, on Monday mg.,) I will write a few lines at once. <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> the little cut you wish for; you shall have it “<hi rend="italic">with all my heart</hi>” if I can <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> find it—that is, <hi rend="italic">pretty readily</hi>: I know I have it <hi rend="italic">somewhere</hi> here, among <hi rend="italic">many</hi> (alas! <hi rend="italic">too</hi> many) unopened packages put up by me on leaving the Bay in 1844!! &amp; never opened since.—I have already written inland, to several, to meet them on 26<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—but I will do what I can <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I <hi rend="italic">see you</hi>.—–</p>
         <p>You are right as to Hardcastle; I was in Museum on Tuesday mg., &amp; Hm. had handed to him my paper. I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to be in town again today—in that wind &amp; dust!! &amp; saw Hardcastle, &amp; <hi rend="italic">thanked</hi> him for his work.—</p>
         <p>Of course <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are at full &amp; perfect liberty to use that Paper for your “Typo,” &amp;c. I said today, to a friend,—that if our <hi rend="italic">irresponsible</hi> Board of Directors at head-quarters should <hi rend="italic">refuse </hi>to admit this Paper into (say) vol. XX, (as they did “In Memoriam,”) that I should get it printed here, &amp; “call on all really good printers in N.Z. to support me.”——</p>
         <p>If my man should be going to Conroy’s in the morning I will <hi rend="italic">send this</hi>;—if not, I shall post it.—</p>
         <p>By the way, I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> Hamilton remarked, he should send <hi rend="italic">early</hi> those Papers (read at various times) to Sir James Hector: so you had better be on the look-out.</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
