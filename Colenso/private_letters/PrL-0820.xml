         <p rend="end">Bickerton’s Hotel<lb/>Woodville,<lb/>Monday Feby 29/92</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>I came hither on 27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. for yesterday’s Ch. duty, &amp; just before I left Dvk. your kind &amp; welcome letter of 25<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. reached me. I cannot tell you in a few words how very pleased I was to get it—written, too, by you under such peculiar circumstances—after a long day’s heavy work <hi rend="italic">and </hi>a long night’s attendance at your great annual meeting! in which you took so prominent, so efficient a part! Well, indeed, it was for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, my dear &amp; trusty friend, that <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi> were present—to speak a word in season <hi rend="italic">re </hi>that ever-to-be-perverted subject, the Maori Lexicon. I cannot sufficiently thank you, for your rushing to the fore. </p>
         <p>I will say nothing of Travers (my quondam Botanical friend!) who, ever since my exposure of J. White’s Waipukurau Moa—that Travers so gloated over!—has become a constant &amp; bitter foe. But I am thinking of sending <hi rend="italic">him</hi> a copy of that Py. Paper (resume M.L. to 1875)<note xml:id="ftn3-575" place="foot" n="575"> Parliamentay Paper (resume of Maori Lexicon to 1875).</note> which you reprinted for me—and which proved of so much service in the case of that other Lawyer, the Taranaki Member, Samuel—but I will not do so until I hear from you in reply to this. Perhaps I had better send to you ½ doz. copies, one for Travers &amp; rest for your own disposal, as none are now to be obtained from Didsbury.—</p>
         <p>I had given an Order to Bates the News-Agent &amp; -seller at Dvk. for copies of the N.Z. Times of that date &amp; was much disgusted with their so-called “Report” of that meeting! which was no report at all—and I should have known nothing had you not so generously written;—and so fully too. And now I must return again to that proposal of mine, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the getting up another <hi rend="italic">resume </hi>(No.2) of the unfort. M.L. down to date.—I feel it the more incumbent on me, being in possession of <hi rend="italic">all </hi>documents (mostly official, to &amp; fro) bearing thereon; besides, to think, that in such a select party as <hi rend="italic">that</hi>—w. <hi rend="italic">old</hi> friends (?) or acquaintances present, and <hi rend="italic">none </hi>to <hi rend="italic">know </hi>the real state of the matter! I am, however, “in <hi rend="italic">two </hi>minds” (as we sometimes say, or think) about this—how best to proceed? Whether through Capt. R., to present my paper &amp; seek for it to be <hi rend="italic">printed </hi>(which you know is almost invariably granted, right off, as a matter of form,)—or, whether in book form by Harding &amp; Co? I somehow think, Capt. R. would willingly take it up, if it were only for the indignity made by Balance &amp; Co, against <hi rend="italic">his </hi>(&amp; their) <hi rend="italic">order </hi>to Didsbury: but let me have your opinion on it.</p>
         <p>Two or three points in yours surprise me, 1) Re Profr. Owen being still alive!! I have surely spoken (written) of him as being <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>! &amp; this I still believe!—2) Your Quotations from Polack (i.e. per Mantell): of <hi rend="italic">one </hi>set of them I had <hi rend="italic">lately</hi> been informed by Hamilton from Dunedin (just before he came away,) which however were <hi rend="italic">new </hi>to me: I have both of his works, &amp; one of them had been lent to H. some 3 yrs. ago: but I did not obtain his works until long <hi rend="italic">after </hi>the founding of our H.B. Phil. Inst, when I saw them noted in a Bookseller’s Cat., &amp; got ’em through W. Wesley &amp; Son. Polack’s slight knowledge (?) of moa bones, he got, no doubt, while he was a kind of prisoner at Tolaga Bay, where in 1838 I saw the hull of his unfort. craft high &amp; dry &amp; ½ destroyed on the sands of the shore, (this formed a conspicuous black object in my pencil drawing of Wairoa—which <hi rend="underline italic">I had foolishly</hi> lent to that <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi>!)</p>
         <p>This letter is mainly on the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> subject. I brought hither w. me, your Paper (Aust. Ass. Sc.), to read &amp; think over, &amp; possibly reply to—also Suter’s <hi rend="italic">beautifully </hi>written translation of a German paper—but cannot enter on it, or them, here.—</p>
         <p>Weather fine, &amp; I pretty well, (steadily improving, you will be glad to know, but withal still <hi rend="italic">very weak in legs</hi>, so that I cannot think of visiting a “Bush,” neither of walking any distance—½ mile!!) had <hi rend="italic">good </hi>Congregations yesterday.—Strange to say, the Bp. came hither on Thursday evg. from Eketahuna,—no doubt to see Ch. warden Burnett—but on Friday Burnett was closely engaged in Court, with that sad affair of J. Hutchings, so that the Bp. could not see him, &amp; the Bp. went on to N. on Friday, <hi rend="italic">without </hi>seeing either Robertshawe or me! &amp; it appears he has no one ready to place here. And my stipulated time has expired!—so that I <hi rend="italic">may </hi>be again impounded. You will remember Wills of Opotiki celebrity: well, he is now serving St. Augustine’s Napier, until Canon Fox arrives (end of March) from Gisborne. And I have heard, that the Bp. intended Wills for <hi rend="italic">this </hi>place (he was here in Jany., preaching, &amp;c.) but the Vestry have informed the Bp.—<hi rend="italic">they will not have Wills</hi>!—Clark, who was formerly here as Lay Reader, is now at Stratford, engaged in some kind of Farming speculation, living with a person named Lockton.—</p>
         <p>My good friend, Rev. R. Stewart, on his return from Auckland last week, wrote to me, that he would fetch me in his buggy this mg. at X.30,—&amp; so he did. I spent 2 pleasant hours w. him in his Manse: he very much wishes me to come here—if only for the summer &amp; autumn months:—for this he has long been desirous. I must return soon to Napier on business matters—<hi rend="italic">imperative</hi>!—; I suppose (say) early <hi rend="italic">next</hi> week!</p>
         <p>You have pleased me much in saying, you already had a few jobs in printing: and that Victor was still improving. I hope to hear that Didsbury is returned—<hi rend="italic">well.</hi>—May your prospect of <hi rend="italic">good </hi>contracts, be speedily &amp; fully realised!—</p>
         <p>With much love &amp; kindest affect. regards &amp; best wishes,—</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>Yours always,</p>
         <p>W.Colenso.</p>
         <p>Have yet to answer—<hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, in former letter, re myself.</p>
