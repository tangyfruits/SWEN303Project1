         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand,<lb/>August 5, 1894.</p>
         <p>My dear Nephew William</p>
         <p>Not having heard from you in reply to my letter of October 19<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>/93, (nearly 10 months ago,) caused me to write to you again: as that letter was an answer to yours, then lately received, and also, in part, <hi rend="italic">a matter of importance</hi>―to which I wished to obtain an <hi rend="italic">immediate answer</hi>―it seems strange to me that you have <hi rend="italic">not </hi>replied. Of course, I know that you duly received it, and the small parcel of books I sent you with it, as I have received a note from the Librarian of your Free Library, thanking me for some of those books I had sent to you. And I have also, from time to time heard (from Sarah and from others), of your <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to write—of your being very busy—of your bad hand, and so on. But surely there must be some other—some hidden reason or cause, why you have not written. Especially, too, as you (in your letter) were the means of my writing about your poor aunt Ellen who, you told me, was living in her old age on the scanty pittance of £16. a year! occasionally &amp; kindly helped by you. I sent you, then, £5. for her, and I wished to do more—<hi rend="italic">while it was in my power</hi>. And I now write to say, that I am desirous of sending £100. (one hundred pounds) to Penzance to be invested for her: and if you will undertake to carry this out quickly, (as you said you had invested her savings of £200,) well &amp; good: I will send it to you for that purpose.</p>
         <p>Now this letter will reach you about Septr. 13<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., let me have your reply by <hi rend="italic">early </hi>Mail after receipt: write at once: mails leave every week <hi rend="italic">now </hi>for N.Z. And should I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hear from you, I shall write to some one else there at P.—it may be a solicitor, or to the Mayor, or to Preby. Hedgeland, or to your brother Richard,—to some proper person.—</p>
         <p>It is not that I am abounding in wealth!! that I wish to do this for her, but because <hi rend="italic">she is old and in want</hi>. And I do not like to leave this important matter (<hi rend="italic">to her</hi>) to be dome by my executors in case of my death,—as such would give them trouble, cause delay, and incur heavy expenses. I am informed, she has been (poor soul!) speaking ill of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and mine—that, however, would rather quicken me to help her (Rom. XII, 20, 21.) but <hi rend="italic">I do not wish for her to know of my doing it</hi>.</p>
         <p>I have been very much “run on” of late and <hi rend="italic">at present</hi>—for <hi rend="italic">heavy </hi>Rates &amp; Taxes, yearly <hi rend="italic">increasing</hi>—Property Tax, Income Tax, Borough Rates, Harbour (Breakwater!) Rates Water Rate, County Rates, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c, and this miserable spendthrift Government (being hard up!) have just passed an act, that the annual Property Tax (not <hi rend="italic">due </hi>until Decr. next), must be paid in <hi rend="italic">one </hi>sum on the 13<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst., and I find it difficult to meet them all. And the reason why such Rates &amp; Taxes are so heavy on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, is owing to my holding some 12 or more sections of land in this Borough which are <hi rend="italic">unoccupied</hi>; and in the market, at present, are not worth ¼th. of what they were 7 years ago—mainly owing to the ever-growing Rates &amp; Taxes! and yet valued by the Govt. valuators at nearly their old original value: so I am determined to sell them all by auction this spring, now near, at a very low fig.</p>
         <p>I hope you &amp; yours are all well. I cannot write any more at present having large &amp; constant correspondents every where, indeed <hi rend="italic">too many</hi>. </p>
         <p>I am keeping pretty well, and with love to you &amp; yours, <lb/>I am your affect. Uncle, Wm. Colenso.</p>
