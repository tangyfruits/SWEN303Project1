         <p rend="end">Napier            Monday night / July 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1880</p>
         <p>Mr John Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I duly received your note of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst, and was pleased to find you were well in health—yet wanting more employ at your trade, &amp;c—I hope that will soon follow, as we have passed the middle of our short winter. One word more in reference to your last remark on the money—<hi rend="italic">be sure you do not send me any </hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps italic">while you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> require it yourself</hi>—if you do, and I know it, I shall send it back. There are 5 full months yet to run to the end of <hi rend="italic">this year</hi>. I had made up my mind last week to write to you <hi rend="italic">this evening</hi>, as B &amp; L’s auction was to take place today, and that bit of land sold by K to you at Taradale, was to be offered, and I had determined to appear &amp; to assert <hi rend="italic">our claim</hi>.</p>
         <p>Well this morning your own good mother came to see me here about it, and we had a long talk—I told her <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, and now she knows a little more than she did before, although you had informed her pretty well. She had, (naturally enough) supposed, that I, in going forward &amp; asserting our right, could effect something.—I told her I should write to you this evening, and that I would tell you, the family were well.</p>
         <p>I suppose I must have told you, of my having seen Banner, some 10 days ago about the affair; well, he went to Bourke, &amp; by &amp; bye came to me with a Memo.—pd Barry £23.14.6. pd Cornford £6.15.10. pd K £15, total £55.10.4, and said if I would pay Bourke that outlay he would give up title to me;—I told B that I represented nearly as much—£30 pd by you to K, and some £15, or so, by me to Lascelles &amp; for registration &amp;c, &amp; that I would not give him the £55.10.4. After some talk I said I would enquire after its value. Since then I have done so, by two separate persons, who went each alone on different days, &amp; reported to me; one said £50, the other £49—as the <hi rend="italic">outside</hi>. Today I went to the auction. L took me into his office &amp; asked if I were willing to make any offer to Mr Bourke. I said, No, but I would consider any offer made by him.—</p>
         <p>The sale went on, about 40 present, but no bidding for anything, or very little; a wretched dull affair. Bourke &amp; his Lawyers were there, Taradale plot came last; so when it was put up, I stepped forward &amp; said that “I held a claim against it”. (I had heard beforehand, that the Lawyers were going to tackle me; they did not, however, do so. L got from them the mortgage (or whatever it was) &amp; threw it on the Clerks table, but no one touched it.) MacDonald of Taradale bid £10—and the Banker Bourke bid £15—MacD asked, if they would guarantee the Title,—but I did not catch the reply (if any). Someone bid £20—&amp; then Bourke bid £25—at which sum it was bought in or knocked down. And the play was over; and we all tumbled out—glad to get out, for I had been there from 2—&amp; it was nearly 4; sale not beginning till nearly 3.</p>
         <p>Before leaving town this evening I was informed that Bourke had said, the Bank would now immediately prosecute me for Damages for hindering the sale; we shall see.—And so I have told you <hi rend="italic">all</hi>—believing <hi rend="italic">you </hi>would be interested in the narration.—Of course <hi rend="italic">now</hi> folks will talk (at Taradale &amp; elsewhere), and K, &amp; Barry (read), &amp; some others <hi rend="italic">this</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">way</hi> will have ugly things said of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> doings &amp; dealings; I have hitherto said very little about it to anyone.—</p>
         <p>I shall send with this a Paper “D.Telegraph” of Sat. evening last—as you may not have seen it up there; in it is a letter of mine about John Harding &amp; the natives at Waipawa.<note xml:id="ftn3-46" place="foot" n="46"> This issue is missing.</note> I only wish Price had published it <hi rend="italic">in full</hi>, as I wrote it; he cut off head &amp; tail; under the plea of <hi rend="italic">no space</hi>. Now I must say goodbye. Hope this may find you in a <hi rend="italic">good</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>, &amp; work plenty, and believe me,</p>
         <p>     Yours very truly.</p>
         <p>             W. Colenso</p>
         <p>English Mail about due &amp; hope to get some papers &amp; send you some. Your mothers visit today reminded me of yours on former occasions and of more than I can write.</p>
