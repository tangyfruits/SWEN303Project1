         <p>Dr Hector</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yesterday I received your telegram <hi rend="italic">re </hi>“Book w. plates”, (Tasm. Journal, vol.II.)—and I now send the same to P.O. to go by steamer tomorrow.—I fancy there are a few <hi rend="italic">other</hi> matters in it (on Geology, &amp;c) which may interest you a wee bit—<hi rend="italic">if you have leisure </hi>which I doubt.—</p>
         <p>You may recollect, that, when here, you asked me, “If I had received back the <hi rend="italic">Bell</hi>?” I replied, No: when you said you would make enquiry, &amp;c &amp;c. I am in no hurry about it (quite the contrary—as I suppose I shall have to <hi rend="italic">pay </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">taxes</hi> on it!!) I merely mention it.—</p>
         <p>After your Lecture (which I should have greatly liked to have seen fairly <hi rend="italic">Reported</hi>, &amp; published for <hi rend="italic">our </hi>benefit—Qu. <hi rend="italic">Could</hi> our staff reporters have done it?) I went off to the woods—but was much baffled by continuous rains; anything but pleasant for a poor Rheumatic subject! However, I ran to shelter—off &amp; on, &amp; did not return till 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ult., but I must go <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, just to get a <hi rend="italic">Metrosideros</hi> in <hi rend="italic">flower</hi> (sp. nov. I believe)—&amp; I purpose doing so next week—15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Owing to so much wet—the season is delayed in the Bush—very different to what it was last year there.</p>
         <p>Shortly after my return I hope to write to you again, &amp; to send you a few Botanl. specimens.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well, also Mrs. Hector &amp; family. I am</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
