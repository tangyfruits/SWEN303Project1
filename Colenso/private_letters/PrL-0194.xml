         <p rend="end">Wellington,<lb/>Saturday night<lb/>August 12/65<lb/>7 p.m.</p>
         <p>My dear Catchpool</p>
         <p>I am here alone in this fine library (Gen. Assy.)—nearly as large as a young Church.—At this hour I ought to have been dining with the Govr.—3 hours ago I sent an apology—as I do not feel well—a tom-cat could knock me down!—I have been very unwell since I wrote to you—&amp; had begun to enquire after a Medical Man—but did without him.—I recd. your kind note for which I thank you much—it was refreshing to see your handwriting. <hi rend="italic">This day</hi> has been one of sad news,—murders at Opotiki, of several whites—&amp; of Fulloon, a Govt. Interpreter &amp; half-caste, (a useful officer)—ditto at Whanganui of Lieut. Waring, 50<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. regt.—loss of the screw “Alexandra”—at White Cliffs Taranaki,—and, last night, a fire here in Wellington, Victoria Hotel burnt down, horses, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>Yesterday, after a long &amp; adjourned debate, a sad sad “petition” (or rather, saucy letter,) from Wm. Thompson the Maori Chief, was <hi rend="italic">received </hi>by the Ho. We fought against it (Ormond &amp; self—Major Richardson, &amp; some others)—but to no effect;—he says, he will have his Maori King—all our doings (fightings) are <hi rend="italic">murders</hi>—we must give up <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the conquered country, &amp;c, &amp;c,—&amp; then he will make peace!!!</p>
         <p>This precious document was written in April to Fitzgerald,—&amp; what makes it the worse, is, that a much later, &amp; better one, written in June, by G. Graham, had been received by us the day before.—Verily what are we coming to!</p>
         <p>It is reported today, as an <hi rend="italic">on dit parly.</hi>—that Fitzgerald is to be Nat. Minister: if so, there will be a jolly row!</p>
         <p>Last Sunday the weather was most doleful wretched wet &amp; miserable! for four days since—Monday to Thursday—delightful—yesterday &amp; today strong W. wind, with dust &amp; sand. It is rumoured the Weld My. is but so-so—&amp; are likely to go down by the run—on the matter of the ⅜ths. which, it is sd., they intend to divide w. the Provs. If so, there will be a fight; we shall know shortly. They are scheming for money in every way—and are (I hear) hard up.—</p>
         <p>I reminded Ormond to take up your case in the Private Grievance Commee. (of which he is a member) &amp; he assured me he would:—we are a <hi rend="italic">little better </hi>“friends” than we were—but I am not to be deceived. We have scarcely begun work yet.—</p>
         <p>Nearly all the Members are now here, and the big room looks well, when it is lit up with its 25 fine large Kerosine Lamps:—often crowded of an evening. It was a painful sight (to me, at least,) to see MacAndrew sworn in—he had just arrived from the S., and was sitting at the farther end, when the Speaker rose, &amp; sd., “If any Member is present who has not been sworn, &amp;c.” Poor McA.! not one of his Otago brethren escorted him, (the rule is, for 2 Mrs. to do so,) and he had to walk up alone—&amp; be sworn, repeating every word in sol. silence—&amp; then to sign the roll, and then go back <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>: it was truly an <hi rend="underline italic">ordeal</hi>! He is, however, of the unblushing cheeky assuranced type:—&amp; since has spoken several times, &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">we</hi> have since crossed swords!—he is going in for a repeal of the N. Provinces Act—and sd. “he never knew of Provl. Councils not doing Justice to outlying Districts”!!! which caused W.C. to rise &amp; speak.—Strange—Cracroft Wilson has been questioning the Govt.— “as to 3–4 R.M’s. at Napier!” and Burns (Otago) as to the statement in H. Bay “<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>”—concerning ammunition to marines from Auckland;—which led to much talk.—</p>
         <p>I am now trying the giving up Dinners (“6 p.m.”)—and taking a Lunch <hi rend="underline italic">as</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> Dinner</hi>, at 2 or 3, instead—of course I lose all the <hi rend="italic">good </hi>things— “4 Courses and a Dessert,”—but I cannot wait till 6, and if I take ever so small a lunch, I cannot eat Dinner.</p>
         <p>Last Tuesday mg. <hi rend="italic">early</hi>, I was surprised by a visit from Capt. Bulkely, A.D.C., to Govr., at my lodgings—to tell me Grey wished me to visit <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the Southern outlying islets—Auckland, Campbell, Emerald,—Ballemy, &amp; other—Islands,—as a Scientific Explorer &amp;c!—to think over it, &amp; to see G.—I saw him on Thursday, &amp;, again, yesterday. Had a long talk—but could not consent to it. Then he wished me to explore, all the islets off the E. Coast N.Z:—making Kawau head quarters—his life boat &amp; 6 good Maori crew, &amp;c—this is not yet <hi rend="italic">settled</hi>. I spoke about the Lexicon, &amp;c., and I think G. was a little put out; he took notes of what I said for ministers—but <hi rend="italic">I expect nothing</hi> from them:—I shewed Grey some of the Offl. letters.—Yesterday I saw Richmond (now acting Nat. Minr.) about Lexn. but got little from him: he sd. it was wanted very much; but the <hi rend="italic">time</hi>—I sd.— “3 years,”—and, “I wod. undertake, <hi rend="italic">on an order of Ho.</hi>, without pay, until finished”;—this he is to consider. [If I would follow Faustus, &amp; sell myself, I cod. get that—or any thing else—in their gift.] Grey wishes much to see my essay on Maories—&amp; Dr. Hector (who is now here) has brought proof sheets, 108—pps.—notes, yet to come.—</p>
         <p>Hope this will find you well, and Mrs Catchpool better.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>ever &amp; always</p>
         <p>Yours truly          W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>McL. has written, to say, he is coming here on 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.—</p>
         <p>P.S. Sunday August 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Fitzgerald <hi rend="italic">is </hi>Nat. Minister!! This will please but <hi rend="underline italic">few</hi>; and will make Weld’s My. <hi rend="italic">weak, now. </hi>I don’t believe they can last out the Session.—</p>
         <p>Sunday 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Weather truly glorious! a dead calm. <lb/>Monday 14. an awful day—wind &amp; dust: Man of War struck her topmasts.</p>
         <p>Monday 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I have written today to the Editor of “Advertiser” concerning his constant misstatements: the Cornerstone of new Cathol. ch. is to be laid next Monday 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>.—Farewell————W.C.—</p>
         <p>P.S. Lyon will pack a small parcel for my Boy, <hi rend="italic">to your address</hi> or care, in a case which he is sending to Stuart &amp; Co. for Howick:—please receive it and send it on to Sutton’s by one of the Traps for Lear.</p>
