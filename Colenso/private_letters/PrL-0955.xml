         <p rend="end">Napier, Jany. 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1896</p>
         <p>Dear Sir James Hector</p>
         <p>In conversing yesterday with Mr. Hill, I found he had sent on to you his Geologl. paper: I, therefore, follow his example and send to you my Botanical ones—<hi rend="italic">so long delayed</hi>. Though, knowing that our Hon. Secy. had gone to Xt.Church to spend his Xmas. holiday there, I was awaiting his return to Napier to send them to you through him—in the ordinary way.</p>
         <p>I suppose you know the reason of them having been delayed? my rt. thumb got very seriously crushed in the Railway carriage in May last on leaving Dannevirke: at first, and for some time, I feared I should lose the top joint, however that has been secured to me, and though I could manage to <hi rend="italic">write </hi>pretty well with my fingers (bandaged thumb always in the way!) I could not succeed at dissection and microscope—and this has caused delay.</p>
         <p>I exhibited the plants now described mounted, at our last meeting in Octr.—also, their <hi rend="italic">rough first drafts</hi>, and am right glad I have done with them: these papers, too, probably, being the last Botanical ones I may ever write: <hi rend="underline italic">I feel age</hi>, and I <hi rend="italic">need rest</hi>.</p>
         <p>I hope you are quite well, and heartily wishing you all the good old compliments of this season. I am, Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Yesterday I replied <hi rend="italic">affirmatively </hi>to Prof. Packer’s (as from you) <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Circular Huxley Memorial.</p>
