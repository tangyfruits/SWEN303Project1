         <p rend="end">Dannevirke<lb/>July 7, 1897.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>—You say, in yours of 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. inst., that you were both surprised and pleased on receiving mine—<hi rend="italic">written </hi>by self!—on 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ult. And I may re-echo your words <hi rend="italic">re </hi>this of yours to me! How often did I during that intervening &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">long</hi> fortnight think on <hi rend="italic">you</hi>! Aye, &amp; sorrowfully too! insomuch that I had <hi rend="italic">queer strange </hi>dreams concerning you &amp; yours. [much after the fashion of these words in your letter— “I was in a very tight place a fortnight ago”:—taken in their <hi rend="italic">worst</hi>!] and I had nearly concluded—to wire (6d.) enquiry to Mrs. Harding fearing you were <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>: for I had supposed that you would write all <hi rend="italic">the sooner</hi> on seeing <hi rend="italic">my own </hi>scribble again!!</p>
         <p>Three weeks have passed since my last to you &amp; here I am still! Ups &amp; downs I have had since in the matter of general health: I am not getting along so fast as I could wish, (we seldom do!) I have been unwell, several days—(now <hi rend="italic">past</hi>) diarrhoea, rather severe, obliged to have recourse to med., and great pains in all big joints (worse in bed!) akin, as it were, to Rheumatism but <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">R</hi>. (Dr. Macallan, this day, told me, such symptoms are common here—from colds.) The weather, too, of late sadly against me—confining me to room; very <hi rend="italic">wet</hi>, not windy. However I have this day written to Gow—purposing leaving here for ’Pukurau 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. if <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>: there about a week, thence to Napier. I would <hi rend="italic">prefer</hi> remaining <hi rend="italic">here</hi> to going to N.—but go, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi>, business (long deferred) calls.——–</p>
         <p>This day I sent you a “Herald” contg. another letter of mine (<hi rend="italic">again</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">correction</hi>!)<note xml:id="ftn3-832" place="foot" n="832">The record reign. <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 24 June 1897.</note> I hope you may approve of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> one. It almost seems a part of my lot (in my <hi rend="italic">old</hi> years) to correct mistakes <hi rend="italic">re</hi> past.—Lately I noticed a speech by Rev. Bumber (Weslyn.) <hi rend="italic">re</hi> early <hi rend="italic">doings</hi> of a “Mr. Lee” in N.Z., one of <hi rend="italic">theirs</hi>—which I believe to be erroneous: <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">a-la-Methm.</hi> always grandly magnifying!!—also another, by Dr. Hocken, re 2 N.Zrs. of “Marsden’s” (?)—containing much of error: I believe from data at Napier I can correct both.—</p>
         <p>I can now read a <hi rend="italic">little better</hi>—memory, &amp; other faculties are improving: <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> yet button shirt collar, use knife, &amp;c, &amp;c.—I hope your “Dicty. for Instit.”, is an <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> on last. I wired a fortnight ago to Govt. Ptr.—I was <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> here &amp; wished proofs—none to hand.</p>
         <p>Thanks for paper (Eg. Post). I suppose Hill will come out next Monday. I regretted seeing Milne-Thompson <hi rend="italic">so </hi>engaged, so situated: Dr. Moore, Prest., Dr. <hi rend="italic">M.-T.</hi> VicePt.—Think Jury acted rightly in <hi rend="italic">verdict</hi>—Judge—wrongly in <hi rend="italic">sentence</hi>. Such sentence is <hi rend="italic">not </hi>reformatory but vindictive! <hi rend="italic">Pleased </hi>in Grand Jy. throwing out Bill for attempted Infant murder! <hi rend="italic">Bosh</hi>. And <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> to find Chemis released—<hi rend="italic">at last</hi>! The “Dy.T.” dreadfully savage <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, on Ch. One of the <hi rend="italic">most</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">pleasing</hi> items in yours is—your separating from Isitt &amp; Co.! <hi rend="italic">You ought</hi> to have done so years ago. <hi rend="italic">Your knowledge</hi> of History—of the S.S., &amp;c, &amp;c, should have led you to do so. I hear more &amp; more <hi rend="italic">against</hi> Soltan every day! he was for many years a Congr. preacher at Launceston Tasma. Some here <hi rend="underline italic">knew</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">him there</hi>, &amp;c!—cannot write any more: <hi rend="italic">arm</hi> pains.</p>
         <p>Kindest regards, Yours truly                     W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S.<lb/>Since my last, sad news:<lb/>1.) Death on 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> May of my eldest son’s <hi rend="italic">only</hi> child—a yg. woman 18 yrs. age. The parents broken-hearted!—“fifteen weeks fighting with death”—at last, her end <hi rend="underline italic">peace</hi>.<lb/>2.) On 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. inst., a “cable” from my nephew— “Father died this morning”. My youngest &amp; only remg. brother. I had, also, heard of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> dangerous illness at Woodville—<hi rend="italic">we</hi> 3. laid up at one time in distant lands: 2 taken and 1 left! <hi rend="italic">Which is the better off?</hi>
            <lb/>
      W.C.</p>
