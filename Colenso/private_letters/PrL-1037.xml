         <p rend="end">Napier, March 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. 1898</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Yours of 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. to hand this morning I thank you for it, and, as I have got rid of much of my writing, I think I will scribble you an answer tonight, there being also 2–3 things in it I wish to notice.</p>
         <p>1.) <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>Mr. Kirk’s death—I was <hi rend="italic">not </hi>greatly surprised when I saw it announced in the “Herald”, as, from his letters to me some time ago, I gathered he was both weak &amp; low &amp; <hi rend="italic">not </hi>improving. It was a pleasing circumstance that you noticed of Chinaman at the grave: I find <hi rend="italic">your story</hi> of “a <hi rend="italic">few only</hi> at funeral” is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> that of “Post”.—–</p>
         <p>2.) It was a wonderful <hi rend="italic">upsetting</hi>, that return of Duthie with such a <hi rend="italic">majority</hi>! (I may mention, that <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, together with Kirk’s death, &amp; you <hi rend="italic">not</hi> writing, made me to think, <hi rend="italic">sad things of you</hi>.)</p>
         <p>3.) Your observation on the big folio in Assembly Library—Owen Jones on “ornament” brings <hi rend="italic">old </hi>doings freshly to mind: I think it was in ’62, on my going to Wgn. to Parliament Session, that soon after arrival a sub.comee. was formed by Speaker, to go to Lyalls, Bookseller, to inspect <hi rend="italic">this very book</hi>, and <hi rend="underline italic">I</hi> was one; L had offered it to Gen. Assembly at a high figure: we went, examd. &amp; reported &amp; it was bought, at a <hi rend="italic">little </hi>lower price. By-&amp; by I, in looking into it, &amp; seeing the plate of <hi rend="italic">Maori </hi>ornament, noticed what I did not believe to be Maori, &amp; so pencilled it lightly on margin. Soon after, my <hi rend="italic">old adversary </hi>Hugh Carleton (Hadfield’s, &amp; Archdn. S.W’s. brother-in-law), noticed it, and in a full house, brought it before them, complaining <hi rend="italic">bitterly</hi>! I told my <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> tale, &amp; House was with me: I wonder if that <hi rend="italic">pencilled </hi>memo. still remains?</p>
         <p>4) Your remark, on parts of “Maori Art,” being at a <hi rend="italic">lower fig. to Members</hi>; <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>, their <hi rend="italic">one copy</hi>: I tried this but was refused: I have taken 3 extra copies, and still remarked on high fig. I learn from Hamilton that the work is stopped <hi rend="italic">for the time—no funds</hi>. I (<hi rend="italic">&amp; others, here,</hi>) a wee bit vexed w. H., at not putting in my account of a well-built ornamental house, but referring to it in <hi rend="italic">p. </hi>“<hi rend="italic">Trans. N.Z. Inst</hi>.,”—and <hi rend="underline italic">copying</hi> H. Wms’. <hi rend="italic">modern </hi>long palaver from “Polyn. Jl.” (Of course to please some one “behind the throne”!) Also, his omitting my finely carved paddle, &amp;c., here in Museum,—and my drawing &amp; descr. of the great war-<hi rend="italic">pa</hi> at Waiapu 1837: H. too, when <hi rend="italic">last </hi>here, begging me <hi rend="italic">to lend him my dwg. for use</hi>:—<hi rend="italic">some</hi> of his plates in “<hi rend="italic">Trans</hi>.” last vol. are hideous! H. has been very ill w. Influenza, in bed a whole week or more, I hope he is recovered.—</p>
         <p>I cannot understand the Binder at Govt. Ptg. Off. being <hi rend="italic">so long</hi> over those small books— “A.”, &amp; cannot help thinking there is some <hi rend="italic">occult</hi> cause at work—time will show. (Does Mackay <hi rend="italic">rule</hi> over Binding Department?) I think I told you I had written to Seddon about the little book, &amp; how greatly I wished for a copy <hi rend="italic">early </hi>(as I had also sd. to Mackay) to send to Sir George—no reply: &amp; then <hi rend="italic">his coming </hi>this way shortly, when, I suppose, I shall see him. His advent, w. Govr., <hi rend="italic">keeps me here</hi>, otherwise I should have gone this week to Bush, again put off till <hi rend="italic">after </hi>their visit. Welsh &amp; wife left on Monday by “Te Anau”, &amp; are now with you at Wgn., “Ruahine” leaving Saturday. I shall feel the loss greatly<hi rend="italic">: almost my only regular &amp; friendly visitor—</hi>twice a week. At his particular desire, I went <hi rend="italic">twice </hi>to St. Augustine’s on Sunday last (13<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">Mg. S. </hi>preached, &amp; read 2 Lessons, &amp; assisted at H.C. (a large no. present): at Evg. S., read prayers &amp; Lessons, returning by IX. Good Congns. both Services.—–This was the <hi rend="italic">first time </hi>since my accident (except once during Synod) that I attended Ch. of an <hi rend="italic">evening</hi>: this time 12 months ago I was at Woodville.—Now for a rather unpleasant episode: I got back on Sunday night, glad to get to house, 2 Domestics anxiously waiting, as I was ½ hour beyond time, (this arose from a meeting of Choir in the Vestry <hi rend="italic">after </hi>Evg. S. to make their presentation &amp; say Good Bye to W., and he begged me to stay w. him)—Well: R. &amp; his wife went to bed: at x.30 I was enjoying my fruit supper, when R. <hi rend="italic">came in</hi> ½ dressed, bringing a letter from <hi rend="italic">Fannin</hi> sent by a <hi rend="italic">special messgr., </hi>&amp; written in a kind of abbd. way &amp; w. lead pencil &amp; rather long—wanting <hi rend="italic">all manner of information re </hi>schools <hi rend="italic">before Province was created</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">also after for many years</hi>, which he <hi rend="underline italic">must have</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> before noon on Monday</hi>!! I sought a little, for an hour, or so,—and as I found I had sent in all education Papers <hi rend="italic">to </hi>him, on my leaving the office of Inspector, (on Mr. Hill’s arrival,) I replied rather warmly next morning.,—I shall send you a copy of “Herald” containing Mr. Ormond’s valediction: some parts of it I like but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the portion <hi rend="italic">re </hi>our early days, &amp; troubles, &amp;c, &amp;c, and <hi rend="italic">while I was holding office of Inspector</hi>:—had it not been for <hi rend="italic">Mr. O</hi>., I would have written to “<hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>” supplying omissions, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>I sent Mr. Luff a copy of booklet &amp; have had a nice letter from him. It <hi rend="italic">seems </hi>rather curious (<hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> may </hi>however understand it,)—I sent a copy each to Rev. Dr. Sidey, Paterson, A. Grant, &amp; Back—but <hi rend="italic">no </hi>acknowledgement: I have however letters from S. Island, thanking, &amp;c, &amp;c.—Crerar tells me he has only sold a <hi rend="italic">few</hi>: I have given away over 50,—and I dare hope for fruit by &amp; by: I told Crerar—they would sell <hi rend="italic">after </hi>I am gone. I have read your clipping (from some unknown P.) of “the Archbishops &amp; the Pope”: but I do not exactly see the gist of it—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> of Vaughan’s, re “<hi rend="italic">Eucharistic Sacrifice</hi>”: this, to me, is clear enough in the letter from the 2 Archbps. to the Pope, (I have a copy of it in both Lat. &amp; English). In Com. S. of Ch. of England, “<hi rend="italic">sacrifice</hi>” is used in two ways: (1) “Xt. on cross, a full perfect &amp; sufficient <hi rend="italic">sacrifice </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">there</hi> for sins of the whole world” (2) “<hi rend="underline italic">here</hi> we offer &amp; present unto thee O Lord, ourselves, our souls &amp; bodies, to be a reasonable holy &amp; lively <hi rend="italic">sacrifice</hi> unto Thee,” &amp;c. The Archbps. in their letter—brings this forward, &amp; show, from the <hi rend="underline italic">old former </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Mass </hi>Book of Rome that such was also that of Rome, <hi rend="italic">before she made the alterations she did </hi>upon her new &amp; monstrous figment of Transubstantiation: a doctrine <hi rend="italic">unknown </hi>to the early Ch., &amp; to the Xn. Fathers.</p>
         <p>Oliver Dean has just, <hi rend="underline italic">again</hi>, got into hot water, through his closely following Isitt, &amp; Co. I shall enclose clipping, from 2 “D.T.” <hi rend="italic">That </hi>Rev. Alanson, “Missioner,” is <hi rend="italic">now inland </hi>at Dannevirke I think, &amp; ? <hi rend="underline italic">Bishop</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>Wms. with him, &amp; I suppose will soon be coming this way. I think I have told you, more than once, that <hi rend="italic">I do not think highly of those peripatetic “Missioners”</hi>—let them go to <hi rend="italic">the dark places</hi>—&amp; lay <hi rend="italic">themselves out there</hi>.—While writing (IX, p.m.) my man back from town bringing letters, and one (short) from Mr. Welsh— “29 Constable Road,” “Friends received us very kindly.”—he was not well, having suffered much during a rough passage.—</p>
         <p>I was sorry to hear from you—of “Wm. being unwell,” hope he will soon be better. Welsman has obtained 3 months leave of absence from Borough Council meetings: he, too, is unwell: I wrote to him a note of sympathy—but no reply. <hi rend="italic">Good night.</hi>
         </p>

         <p>Ever yours—</p>
