         <p rend="end">Bickerton’s Hotel,<lb/>Woodville,<lb/>Sunday, Feby. 14/92<lb/>2.30 p.m.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Hill</p>
         <p>Here am I again—pretty well, but <hi rend="italic">not </hi>strong: and as I did not go to Victoria (for a 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi> sermon) I think I cannot do better than <hi rend="italic">begin </hi>a letter to you:—hoping to finish the same tomorrow evening at Dvk.—</p>
         <p>Before I came away from Dvk. (at 3 p.m. yesty.) I recd. your kind &amp; most welcome letter of the 12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst., such a long one, too! I have again read it <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, with much pleasure, and as an old and <hi rend="italic">true </hi>saying of our fathers is uppermost in my mind, from reading the same—I just give it—that “a broken bone <hi rend="italic">well set </hi>is stronger than it was before.</p>
         <p>My table is shaky and my hand is alsoshaky after this morning’s service, so you must excuse this writing.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, of your good &amp; respected wife Mrs. Hill: I hope &amp; <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> that this important domestic event you are waiting to see over will also be <hi rend="italic">a sure means of establishing Mrs Hill’s health</hi>: my best respects to her.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>: the little plant specimen you so kindly sent me, <hi rend="italic">before </hi>receipt of your letter; this arrived safely tho’ bruised &amp; battered <hi rend="italic">before </hi>you put it up in its box: it is wholly new to me, &amp; I have grave doubts of it being a N.Zr. (I have <hi rend="italic">no </hi>Bot. books here (at Dvk.) w. me.) I cut carefully off a sm. <hi rend="underline">un</hi>opened unbruised flg. branchlet and have brought it hither w. me, &amp; it is now in water in the sun by my side. It is certainly not a liliaceous plant; indeed I am in doubt of it being a Monocotyledon; but hope on my return to Napier to know more about it. I am pleased to find you have <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, &amp; roots too; preserve a whole spn. for me, with ripe fruit or seeds.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>: Last wk., on Thursday, I recd. a letter from the Bp. asking me (if able) to take the Services here for Feby., &amp; this I have consented to do—adding, also, a “rider”, of which more, anon. (How things have come about!!) Next Sy. however R. will come hither, (as he has not been here for 2–3 months, &amp; he wishes to do so,) and I take his place on that Sy. at Dvk.—Early in March I hope to be in N., &amp; <hi rend="italic">may </hi>be in time to catch you there ere you go N.—Congn. this mg. (I am sorry to say) was small, about 40, of whom <hi rend="italic">only 9 were men</hi>! One of these being our friend Large, who w. Mrs. L., are on their way to Wgn:—the weather too delightful. I should, however, say, that there was a kind of uncertainty about Service; as last Sy. I said, “it should be advertised in “Exr.” (on Fy. &amp; Saty.): and Robertshawe’s advt.—written in my room by R. &amp; posted on Fy., was <hi rend="italic">not </hi>inserted by Haggen!!—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>:—Your and Harding’s “<hi rend="italic">serious </hi>matter” <hi rend="italic">re </hi>this O. M., is (like many other ghosts of our raising!) next to nothing, vanishing into thin air, &amp; on examination— “a mountain in labour! a ridiculous mouse”. You kindly in your usual warm way think too highly of the past (of <hi rend="italic">my </hi>past)—it is true I could write <hi rend="italic">many </hi>a strange occurrence: (just as Sir J.D. Hooker, in his last <hi rend="italic">affecte. </hi>&amp; long letter, says, deploringly!— “What a mass of information will die w. you!!”) and it has (I assure <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> privately</hi>) been a source of unquiet to me, especially in <hi rend="italic">past </hi>years,—that I have <hi rend="italic">no son</hi> nor relative, nor friend possessing both leisure &amp; readiness, to have care &amp; could commit all my old Mss.—of 60 years:—but I have <hi rend="italic">learned</hi>, at last, to outlive that.– – – Perhaps, I may lock them up for <hi rend="italic">at least </hi>50 years after d., but then my <hi rend="underline">un</hi>written lore far exceeds the written. This is an unpleasant theme. I have often thought of employing a secretary!!</p>
         <p>By a late mg. mail I recd. a Catalogue of Books from a Londn. Bookseller (unknown to me), in which Tregear’s Maori Dicty. is spoken highly of, &amp; I, w. mine!, am brought forward as a poor kind of thing, a foil—I have sent the Cat. to Hg. w. a <hi rend="italic">draft</hi> of a note to London, which I intend forwarding together w. a copy of that Parly. P. of 1875 <hi rend="italic">re </hi>M. Lex.—just to open his eyes.—and I have been thinking of getting up a 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi> paper (from ’75 to ’91) to leave on record how I have been subsy. treated.—From the Papers I learn, that Tregear (<hi rend="underline italic">now openly</hi> enjoying a Govt. billet) will shortly be in N. Very likely T. will see you (from your high office)—and he <hi rend="italic">may </hi>enq. after me: <hi rend="italic">I do not wish to see him</hi>: so, please, do not let him know from you of my place of residence. I have never looked into his Dy., (from the first glimpse) and am wholly against his (or John White’s, or Manning’s) Maori romances or “Fairy tales” (?) being <hi rend="italic">introduced into our schools</hi>! such I consider would be ultimately injurious to <hi rend="italic">both races</hi>.</p>
         <p>Of course you will have seen in the Papers the sad row<hi rend="underline">s</hi> in the great Synod! How anyone can support Fitchett is a marvel to me! I consider his acting to arise from his old (&amp; recent) <hi rend="italic">status</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Metht. Minr. His </hi>letter <hi rend="italic">re </hi>same is in Wgn paper of yesty. (N.Z. Times), and <hi rend="italic">he</hi>, I am glad to find, is <hi rend="italic">returned </hi>to Dunedin. No doubt the primate was a little hasty, but for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> he amply apologized. That Canon Howell is the same creature that performed there in the Cathedral before <hi rend="italic">you </hi>in Napier; and I (tho’ <hi rend="italic">no </hi>lover of Hadfield) am pleased at his inhibiting him in his Diocese.</p>
         <p>I am very sorry to hear that the Bp’s. sister is so very ill: I hope she is now better—it must be a sore trial, just now too, to her brother our Bp.—iv. p.m. Here I stop.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">15</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">.. </hi>3 p.m. as I am idle! waiting for evg. train to Dvk. I may as well finish my letter <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. Last evg. a crowded Congn., very pleasing—but <hi rend="italic">perhaps </hi>I over-exerted myself, as I had a sad nt. of unrest &amp; <hi rend="italic">coughing</hi>: Burnett, in Vestry at close, congratulated me, on having regained strength &amp; voice, “so different to what it was last Sy.” but he little knew the <hi rend="italic">penalty</hi>!—I looked-in on Haggen this mg. to enq. <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Advt. he said, he only saw it this mg.! as it came by <hi rend="italic">late </hi>Mail on Saty. Large &amp; wife went on this mg. to Wgn. by Rimutaka route: I was sorry they were not at Ch. last evg. to see a good attendance. Burnett, Chwdn. (Mayor, Solicitor, &amp;c.) told me in Vy. that the poor attendance in the mg. was owing to <hi rend="italic">Clarke</hi>—who had given them usually such poor sermons, fit, at best, for Sy. Sch. Children, that only women, <hi rend="underline italic">girls</hi> &amp; children attended Mg. S.—(Clarke being a <hi rend="underline italic">Bachelor</hi>, &amp;c.)</p>
         <p>I wrote this mg. to Makotuku, saying I should be <hi rend="italic">there </hi>next Friday, returning to Dvk. by evg. train. In “Bush Advocate” of Thursday 11<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., is a long tirade of the school <hi rend="italic">there</hi>—in which are some remarks you should see—you may find it in its <hi rend="italic">proper place </hi>at Athenæum.</p>
         <p>I should much like to know how things in general are going on at N. Do you see anything of the Bp.? <hi rend="italic">I wish much to hear from him</hi> in reply. I fear his poor dear sister <hi rend="italic">may </hi>succumb to this <hi rend="italic">fell </hi>disease. I had fears, last nt., that I was in for <hi rend="italic">another </hi>attack! and, if so, Good bye, all hands—<hi rend="italic">Exit </hi>O. M.—</p>
         <p>With very kind regards Believe me</p>
         <p>Ever &amp; always Yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p>(Write, should you find spare time)</p>
         <p>P.S. After all I shall post this at Dannevirke, by which you will get it <hi rend="underline italic">earlier</hi>.</p>
