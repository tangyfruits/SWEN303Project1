         <p rend="end">Napier, Xmas. Day, 1882.</p>
         <p>My dear Mr. Cheeseman,</p>
         <p>I must no longer put off replying to your note of Nov.22 (received here during my long absence in the far-off “Bush”)—although I have (I regret to say) others of a prior date to yours still rather anxiously waiting in my ever-growing bundle of <hi rend="italic">unanswered </hi>letters. On my return I had so very much to do (mainly important business) that I could not possibly write to you: and then I was obliged <hi rend="italic">unexpectedly </hi>to leave home again for a whole week, only returning 3 days ago.</p>
         <p>To your letter: I fear I shall not have it in my power to aid you <hi rend="italic">re </hi>spns. Of the genus <hi rend="italic">Carex</hi>,—especially from all this extensive sea-board “S. of East Cape,”—as mentioned by you. Formerly many species were to be found on the adjoining extensive marshy flats, but almost all indigenous vegetation has for many miles around disappeared, before the <hi rend="italic">immigrant lot </hi>aided by draining &amp; fires!—and I do not know of a single person between this place &amp; the E. Cape, or here in Napier, to whom I could apply. Of specimens formerly sent to Sir W. Hooker I rarely kept specimens (duplicates), and I have no proper Herbarium. I agree w. you that N.Z. is rich in <hi rend="italic">Carices</hi>, and, indeed, in <hi rend="italic">Cyperaceæ</hi> generally; and, that the genus <hi rend="italic">Carex</hi>, as given in the “Hd.Book” greatly needs both revision &amp; addition:—and so with not a few of its other genera.—</p>
         <p>In our Instit. Papers of last winter, sent to Dr. Hector, I described (among several other <hi rend="italic">sp. nov</hi>.) 3 plants of <hi rend="italic">Cyperaceæ</hi>–viz. 2 <hi rend="italic">Uncinia</hi> &amp; 1 <hi rend="italic">Carex</hi>. I shall not be again going to the distant forest before April, but if I go then, and I meet w. anything new or striking, of the <hi rend="italic">Carex </hi>family, I will not forget you.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> “<hi rend="italic">Exarrhena</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">petiolata</hi> being in <hi rend="italic">this neighbourhood</hi>”: I see (Hand Book) Sir J.D. Hooker has given 2 localities for it (as from me) “in Hawke’s Bay”—Cape Turnagain being the <hi rend="italic">nearest</hi>! (see Map.) But, were I there, or at the other locality “Puehutai,” I doubt if I could find a single plant in its old haunts. Sheep &amp; Cattle, Clover, Grasses, Weeds, and Fires, have effectually done their work of extermination. I gaze w. astonishment on meeting in my journeys w. any well-known wee little plant of the <hi rend="italic">olden </hi>time,—once, too, so common! During my last journey I fell in w. some plants of <hi rend="italic">Oreomyrrhis, Nertera, Galium, Craspedia, Gnaphalium, Ophioglossum, </hi>&amp;c.,—which I was right glad to see,—&amp; took off my hat to! But I well recollect that all our small plants of both <hi rend="italic">Myosotis</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Exarrhena</hi> genera were very few &amp; far between in this District.—</p>
         <p>Thanks for all your kind offers.—I am <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to be brief just now, as time w. me is precious: but, in writing at <hi rend="italic">this </hi>season, I heartily wish you a Happy New Year.—</p>
         <p>                             Believe me, Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                                     Wm Colenso.</p>
