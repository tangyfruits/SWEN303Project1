         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Novr. 16, 1869</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your kind mote of 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I received yesterday. I had previously received your telegram—to which I should have replied in <hi rend="italic">like </hi>manner if I had your privilege—or if it had required an immediate answer.—I cannot understand for the life of me how you can suppose <hi rend="italic">I </hi>ever had the Mss.!! why, if I had had it <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, of course the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> (which I always wished to be printed) could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be printed! You will recollect that the Notes were <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi> printed at Dunedin—merely the Essay. When in Wellington in ’65, I read <hi rend="italic">your </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">one</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> complete </hi>Proof for Press—but it had no notes,—and I am pretty sure that I must have then &amp; there seen the ms. (of <hi rend="italic">Essay only </hi>perhaps)—and returned it to you from Gen Assy. Liby. the Copies you sent me from Dunedin—some 6 or so, (stabbed through &amp; tied with big cord) only went so far as 88 page, or thereabouts.—One of these I gave to Sir George on his leaving N.Z. for England.—</p>
         <p>However, <hi rend="italic">I know nothing </hi>of the unfort. Ms. and must now turn to &amp; copy those notes—some of them I can do readily enough from Ms. notes of them (<hi rend="italic">rough</hi>):—I only wish I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> promised them to Dr. Hooker: I have not time; &amp; vastly too much daily &amp; nightly writing &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I am glad to hear from you of your being so well employed: shall be very glad to <hi rend="italic">see </hi>you here. Look out, if you have no <hi rend="italic">good </hi>golden news to tell our “citizens” anent the Kaimanawa!—more anon.</p>
         <p>No doubt I could get out something for your vol. if I had time at disposal:—but (<hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi>) don’t you think I ought <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to be admitted a Member?—Have you forgotten what I said once before on this?</p>
         <p>Could you get me another Copy of your 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. vol.—or one cheap. I must tear up this one for Hooker, and I have already bought 4! &amp; paid postage on 3 of them to England.</p>
         <p>Am glad to hear that H. got his Cabinet,—that K. saw it (and him), and that H. was “proud of it”.</p>
         <p>Would you mind asking Mantell, if he has not some <hi rend="italic">stores</hi> (however old) of Southern Island words (Maori)—and if he would let me have them? I have long been about writing to him. Excuse this scrawl and Believe me ever,</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
