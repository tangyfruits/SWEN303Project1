         <p rend="end">Napier Tuesday night <lb/>Dec 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1883</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balf our</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I purpose leaving for the Bush on Friday, &amp; returning that day fortnight (before the Xmas, to allow of my people here having holiday, &amp; I see, I must write to you <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi>, if I write to you at all before I leave. I thank you over &amp; over for your last <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> present, they came in at a time when I was <hi rend="italic">done</hi> up, fagged out, in court <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">day</hi>
            <hi rend="sub"> </hi>with the badgering, bothering Lawyers, (not that they bother me—they do, one ano­ther; &amp; the old Judge sits quietly by!!.) Of course you will see a little of it in the papers, (but enough of that).<note xml:id="ftn3-210" place="foot" n="210"> Sheehan v. Robertson. In this case plaintiff sued as executor and trustee of the late Karaitiana Takamoana. The action was brought to recover possession of part of the Pakowhai block, 427 acres, and for £500 damages. The lawyers were Stout and Lascelles.</note>
         </p>
         <p>Your little gem like flowers enchanted me; their little Red Riding hood bonnets, of such a charming hue.<note xml:id="ftn3-211" place="foot" n="211">
               <hi rend="italic">Corysanthes papillosa</hi> Col.</note> I freshened them with water (also a lit­tle <hi rend="italic">Hepatica</hi>) &amp; left them until next day, when I quietly had my (selfish?) feast—but I had no <hi rend="italic">one</hi> to partake with me, &amp; you were not nigh. Curiously enough, it was only the day before, that I, despairing of hearing from you again in your <hi rend="italic">busy time</hi>, &amp; anxious to send off my Bot Ms to Dr H,—I had taken out those 3 you had sent in sp, and had spent a mg in drawing up their descriptions, after ascertaining they were dis­tinctly new spn, &amp; not one of those of Australia; &amp; now these fresh beau­ties came to hand, so I had to go over my work again, &amp; add a little, &amp; write out a fresh fair acct. And so w the <hi rend="italic">Hepatica</hi> (which I had also had before, but not in such perfection as these).</p>
         <p>I would give a golden guinea to see those Orchids, &amp;c, <hi rend="italic">growing</hi>. I am sure there are <hi rend="italic">other</hi> good <hi rend="italic">little wee things w them.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I marvel at 2 things—your doing so <hi rend="italic">much</hi> in the shearing way, &amp; your do­ing so much in the <hi rend="italic">Bot</hi> way at <hi rend="italic">this time.</hi> I saw Mr K<note xml:id="ftn3-212" place="foot" n="212"> John  Gibson Kinross.</note> in town today (my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> day there), and I said to him, how pleased I was to find you had done so much <hi rend="italic">in the wet</hi> weather, &amp;c, in which he also agreed, &amp; I thought seemed <hi rend="italic">pleased.</hi> I wonder how P.D.<note xml:id="ftn3-213" place="foot" n="213"> Peter Dolbel.</note> is getting on?.</p>
         <p>Another remark of yours, my Dear Sir, pleased me much, viz, your saying you had <hi rend="italic">again</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">read</hi> the little book.<note xml:id="ftn3-214" place="foot" n="214"> Probably Colenso W. 1883. <hi rend="italic">Three literary papers read before the Hawke’s Bay Philosophical Institute during the session of 1882: —I and II, On Nomenclature; III, On “Macaulay’s New Zealander.”</hi> Daily Telegraph Office, Napier. 41p.</note> Some, I fear, have not even looked at it, so, no wonder they have not responded to my <hi rend="italic">Yellow</hi> Circular.</p>
         <p>I happened to go into a members house here in town, &amp; there was the book <hi rend="italic">in its envelope</hi>, unopened; another, &amp; a member of our Council, told me, he had read the first page; while another said, he did not remember the Yel­low C. If you should wish for a (spare) copy for your Public Library—I can <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you one.</p>
         <p>I shall<hi rend="sup">-</hi>send with this a copy of another little work of mine, (I have lately sent a lot to Melbourne, &amp;c, having been written to for them).<note xml:id="ftn3-215" place="foot" n="215"> Colenso W 1878. <hi rend="italic">Tracts for the times; No. 1, On the Sabbath and its due observance</hi>. Napier, Dinwiddie, Morrison &amp; Co. 46p.</note> You may have seen it before—and as a Scotchman (that is, a <hi rend="italic">clannish</hi> one, &amp; an <hi rend="italic">out &amp; out Hielander</hi> in opinion) you may not agree with me in it; nevertheless, I will run the risk of all that.</p>
         <p>I find that Mr Sheriffs life was insured for £500 here, &amp; £200 more at Home, but this last sum they may not get.</p>
         <p>If you are <hi rend="italic">not too</hi> busy, let me find a line from you on my return, or get one before “83” dies, that I may be able to write you one early with the new year. And now good bye to ye, and with kind regards &amp; best wishes for the folk at Glenross, believe me Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. Were I staying at home, I would gladly accept a few more Corysanthes but if sent in my absence, would only rot.</p>
