         <p rend="end">C.M. Station, Hawke’s Bay,<lb/>N. Zealand, Decr. 31, 1846.</p>
         <p>Ronald Gunn, Esq.,<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Although an entire stranger to your person yet not to your name, nor to that Science in which you have done so much for your adopted land—I venture to write you a few lines respecting the Nos. of the “Tasmanian Journal,” and of some little printing which (I believe) Mr Wade got done for me in Tasmania.—To which I am the more emboldened from the kind manner in which you make mention of my name in your note to Rev. J.P. Gell, of June 4/46.—</p>
         <p>The last No. of the “T. Journal” which I have received, is no. vii vol. 2,—any subsequent nos. I shall therefore most gladly receive. I wished to have duplicates &amp; triplicates of those nos. which might contain any papers of mine. I cannot account for Mr. Wade’s not informing me.—</p>
         <p>If the Tasmanian Society still continues to publsih their Journal, I may yet be able to add a Contribution, having one or two things upon the <hi rend="italic">stocks.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>If there are any specimens among the N.Z. Flora (of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> district) which you would like to have, I would endeavour to secure them for you. We might, in fact, exchange “to mutual advantage” as they say. The <hi rend="italic">Ferns </hi>of your Country would be to me a <hi rend="italic">desiderata</hi>, and, as I suppose you have a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> garden and I have a place fenced in <hi rend="italic">intended </hi>for one, I will even venture to ask another favor,—in the shape of Bulbs of any plants—or roots, anemones, ranunculuses, &amp;c—or seeds—in short, anything that may be safely packed up with the books.</p>
         <p>Forgive me, my dear Mr. Gunn, if I have unwittingly exceeded.—Command me in any way in my power, and <lb/>  believe me, with much respect, yours very sincerely</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
