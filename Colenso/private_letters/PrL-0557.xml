         <p rend="end">Napier Feb 26/84</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour<lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have been “fashing” and “worriting” myself a good deal for several days—&amp; all about <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. For, I have been expecting again &amp; again to hear from you. I think (not positive) that I wrote to you last, ab­out six weeks back. I have also hunted through my ever growing pile (!) of unanswered letters, but there is nothing of yours <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. However, though I am busy writing Home, I will stand it no longer—but write a few lines “<hi rend="italic">for auld L syne</hi>!”</p>
         <p>If I could see you, I have much to say—to talk over—scarcely worth writing. If I recollect aright my last to you, was written some time be­fore our annual meeting on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst; that was a <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> one; matters arising from it are not yet <hi rend="italic">settled</hi>. On the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> by early train I left for 70 mile bush, remained there for a fortnight, returning on night of 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Had my <hi rend="italic">usual</hi> wet luck <hi rend="italic">there</hi>; but gained what I <hi rend="italic">specially</hi> went for, flowers of my new <hi rend="italic">Panax</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fruiting</hi> spns of my new <hi rend="italic">Fagus</hi>,—but in securing them had to walk six long weary miles in rain, without a wrap. While inland—&amp; <hi rend="italic">in the house</hi>—I had a <hi rend="italic">very severe</hi> fall,—I re­turned, bringing its effects with me, (just the same as a heavy fall from a horse, years ago,—whole frame shook, sore, &amp; suffering pain) &amp; this confined me a <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> week; now I am getting alright again—for a <hi rend="italic">little longer.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I suppose you saw the account of our meeting in the D.T. &amp; therefore I did not send you a copy. I have lately sent one from Wgn, a “N.Z. Times”of 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst, containing the account of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> annl. meeting.</p>
         <p>Dr Buller is the President, &amp; came out strong with his address, in which he spoke largely, &amp; prominently of <hi rend="italic">our Maori papers</hi> in the Vol of the “Trans”, &amp; the <hi rend="italic">others</hi> (Dr Newman, Mr R Hart,Waterhouse, &amp;c) took it up warmly also; so that Dr Hector was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to yield assent, &amp; then came about <hi rend="italic">my papers.</hi> All this shows, that <hi rend="italic">much</hi> must have been thought &amp; said anent them down S.</p>
         <p>I have sent to Wgn for copies of that paper, &amp; <hi rend="italic">if I get them</hi> I will re­member Glenross.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi> having been done toward the getting the last years “Proceedings” the “Lists of members” &amp;c, ready for Dr H &amp; this <hi rend="italic">forthcoming</hi> Vol,—I, though laid up here, wrote to Dr Spencer about it &amp; he came here to see me, &amp; I agreed to write them out on his asking me as V.P. at <hi rend="italic">once</hi>; this I did &amp; sent them off last Saturday. All the Secretarys Books, Papers, &amp;c, &amp;c, are still here with me; &amp;, what the end may be, I cannot say. It is said, to be at the <hi rend="italic">darkest</hi> just <hi rend="italic">before dawn</hi>. I received your sweet wee spn of <hi rend="italic">Hepatica</hi>, in the little match box, but I feared they had been <hi rend="italic">some time shut up</hi>. I tried to bring them round but failed. I think I had it from you before. Now if you are, or have been, <hi rend="italic">very busy</hi>, crops &amp;c, I’ll forgive you, but I do think I ought to have a line from a <hi rend="italic">friend</hi>, for I have had to go through deep waters, and am <hi rend="italic">not yet</hi> landed on dry land. With kind regards &amp; best wishes, believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Wednesday 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. In looking again this morning at the Hepatica, &amp; the box it came in, I find the box scratched 16/1/84 D.P.B.—&amp; the P.O. stamp on label, marked “Jan 29.”</p>
