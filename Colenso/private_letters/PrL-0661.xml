         <p rend="end">Tuesday mg. 7th</p>
         <p>Mr Harding</p>
         <p>My dr Sir</p>
         <p>Thanks for kind note of last evg. We think alike on <hi rend="italic">many</hi> things. I could scarcely have thought R.P. would have <hi rend="italic">so</hi> lowered himself! but then water never rises <hi rend="italic">above</hi> its own level. Although busy (writing to Engd. too long deferred)—I took up pen to <hi rend="italic">expose</hi> him, seriatim: but I found it would make rather <hi rend="italic">too long</hi> a letter, doubtful if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would insert it;—and I was in too sarcastic a vein (or too unmerciful!) to deal gently—especially after my <hi rend="underline italic">long</hi> talk w. Knowles (<hi rend="underline italic">Propr</hi>.) on Friday mg.—of which, <hi rend="italic">more anon</hi>.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Perhaps</hi> you are right, as to “Beauty’s best” being a <hi rend="italic">quotation</hi>,—though I have my doubts. I know I had 2 or 3 such then (&amp; now) running in mind—as “When unadorned, adorned the most,” &amp;c., &amp;c.—–<hi rend="italic">Johnstone</hi> never occurred to me—perhaps owing to my having had, at that time, (&amp; for some months before) much correspce. w. <hi rend="italic">Johnstone</hi> of the “Star” hotel.—</p>
         <p>Two things I would say to you now. I think we should get in, somewhere, 2 of your nice &amp; eminently suitable cuts—the <hi rend="italic">trio</hi>, Schæffer, Faust, &amp; Gutt., &amp; the one in <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of “Report,” ’88.—</p>
         <p>I am arranging w. Blair for a lith. of <hi rend="italic">Paihia</hi> from the old sketch—as that place is now no more! B. can do it, &amp; I believe well. I had intended going to see him today but cannot well do so (having promised to help H. for <hi rend="italic">next</hi> Monday evening): must write to Ham. re <hi rend="italic">no. of subsrs.</hi>, tho’ I fear he has but <hi rend="italic">few</hi>! Proofs sadly wanted.</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. As 2 heads are frequently better than 1, (tho’, on t’other hand, “too many cooks spoil the prose”)—if in going on w. the work, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> thing as amendts. or improvts. occurs to you— “make a note of it” &amp; forwd. to W.C.———–</p>
         <p>I grieve more than ever over your very thin paper! &amp; paleness of 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> ½ sheet. How very different these proofs look on better paper.</p>
