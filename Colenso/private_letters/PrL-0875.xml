         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>July 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, 1893.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir James Hector</p>
         <p>On Saturday night (29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst.) I received from you a copy of “Manual of Coleoptera,” parts v, vi, vii, in 1 vol., and as I had already received a copy from you (a few weeks back) I return this to you with thanks.—</p>
         <p>I note what you have said in the preface, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> not publishing this work in vol. “Trans.”,—which pleases me: and it has occurred to me, that were you to deal similarly with Mr. Marshall’s Coccididæ, such would be equally advantageous:—especially now that he has become universally known as an expert A1. in that line, and so receives Cocci in numbers from <hi rend="italic">abroad</hi>.</p>
         <p>I duly received your kind letter of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst.—no doubt you are quite right with reference to that so-called antique ship (or its wreck) and the inscription in <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> letters, as being a hoax! I felt vexed with myself when I read it,—<hi rend="italic">i.e. at my own stupidity </hi>in not noticing that, and so not to trouble you—But, as Hamilton sent the clipping up to me, so I despatched it <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> to you.</p>
         <p>Then your remark concerning my half-projected Paper:<hi rend="italic">I agree wholly with you</hi>: and so shall not (this year) trouble myself about it—if ever. Besides, I have already written <hi rend="italic">two</hi> (read on 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst.,) and have two other “on stocks”—one of these, perhaps, I may send on to the Wgn. Phil. Sy.,—as “<hi rend="italic">in duty bound</hi>,”—</p>
         <p>At our Meeting on 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. a letter (packet) was produced (that had just that day arrived) from “the Phil. Inst. Canterbury”, containing a copy of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> Petition to Parliamt. <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the printing of a 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. ed. of the “Handbook N.Z. Flora,” &amp;c. I have since seen it, with its accompanying papers. I cannot agree in the Petition in its entirety; though I greatly desire to see a 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. ed. of the “Handbook”: but, in my opinion, it should be a <hi rend="italic">reprint</hi> with <hi rend="italic">no </hi>alteration save the putting Hooker’s <hi rend="italic">own</hi> corrections and additions into their proper places as are indicated by him. If otherwise, then the work should be entrusted <hi rend="italic">to an English Botanist of standing </hi>)A1, and master of general Botany—much as Bentham did in the <hi rend="italic">Flora Australiensis</hi>—which contained <hi rend="italic">Hooker’s Fl. Tasm</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Brown’s Prodr. N. H.</hi>, <hi rend="italic">&amp; others</hi>:)—local Botanists and Collectors assisting, as we (including yourself) did for Hooker. I feel the more, perhaps on this point, from having been appointed by Sir David Monro to move &amp; support the “Handbook” in Parlt., in 1861: Sir George being Governor, who also was in favour of it. I should regret to see Hooker’s work cut in and out by inferior hands!——</p>
         <p>Trusting you are quite well, and with kind regards.</p>
         <p>     I am,</p>
         <p>             Yours faithy.,</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
