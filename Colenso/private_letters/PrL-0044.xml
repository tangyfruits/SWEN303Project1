         <p>Gilbert Mair, Esq., <lb/>      Deveron, <lb/>          Wangarei.</p>
         <p rend="end">St. John’s College,</p>
         <p rend="end">The Waimate.</p>
         <p rend="end">March 1st., 1844.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I wrote you a scrap of a Note when near Waiomio on my way home—which you may not have received. I returned to the Waimate on the 15th. of February, having been absent 137 days. I had a very long round, and quite an adventurous one—had, also, the pleasure of seeing Mr. Kissling, Mr. Stack, Mr. Brown, Mr. Baker, Mr. W. Williams, Mr. Ashwell, and Mr. Buller—and they are all well. I must defer anything like an account of my trip until I see you, which I hope to do, sometime this winter. I suppose you will have heard of the <hi rend="italic">stranger</hi>, who arrived before me—on the 1st. Feby. Mrs. C. was safely delivered of a daughter, and I am happy in being able to say they are both doing well. I found, also, your kind note of November 4th., for which I thank you much; I shall always be most happy to get any information respecting the Natives of Wangarei, (who are dearer to me than they have any idea of), and such information will always be doubly valuable when it happens to come from an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> friend like yourself. I do not see any prospect of my being allowed to spend my days among those Natives,—should I not, I hope they will have a Pastor, who, <hi rend="italic">knowing</hi> the green pastures and cooling waters belonging to the Chief Shepherd, will delight in leading his flock thither. Poor souls! I often think of them.</p>
         <p>I am very sorry to find that a Collection was made for poor Gordon Brown during my absence; I did all I could to prevent it before I went away, and thought I had succeeded in putting a stop to it. I have had letters lately from Octavius and Charles, and shall write them in a day or two. Poor Gordon’s sun has set under a Cloud! I dare however, hope that our Heavenly Father—whose tender mercy is over all his works, and who never willingly grieves nor afflicts the children of men—has had mercy on his soul. We have good reason <hi rend="italic">so</hi> to believe, for we know that <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> hears and answers prayer—and many, very many, have been the earnest petitions on his behalf at a throne of Grace. Octavius says, (in his letter to me of the (some day) February 1843), “Remember me most kindly to Mr. Mair and family, from whom I have received many kindnesses.” I will show you his letter when I see you; it is a very nice one.</p>
         <p>I have, also, had a letter from Dr. Fox, Hooker, (who was here in H.M.S.S. “Erebus”, in 1841), written from the Falkland Islands, in which he particularly requests to be remembered to his “kind friends, Mr. and Mrs. Mair”.</p>
         <p>Really, when I look back upon past days, and think upon the many events which have from time to time come under my observation,—the many happy hours I have had,—and the many dear friends with whom I have had the pleasure of conversing—I ask myself the question—are such times for ever fled? Oh, Yes!—there is indeed a wonderful alteration come upon <hi rend="italic">people</hi>, as well as upon <hi rend="italic">times</hi>, and I fear not for the better either – – – – but this is, to me, a painful subject, so I will quit it. May <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, my dear friend, <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> the vanity of earthly happiness, seek and gain that heavenly inheritance, which is incorruptible, undefiled, and fadeth not away!</p>
         <p>Blessed be God! <hi rend="italic">that is</hi> “<hi rend="italic">reserved</hi>” in Heaven for all His people!!</p>
         <p>Mr. Davis has this day heard from Serena, they are safely arrived at their station (Nelson), and like it pretty well: the country about appears to be barren. Mr. D. has, also, this day heard from Mr. Jos. Matthews—his good wife has just had a daughter!—One generation passeth away and another cometh.</p>
         <p>Remember me very kindly to Mrs. Mair, Miss Mair, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> your family, as if named, taki tahi. I must write a line to Mr. Kier, and Stephen, and Manihera. Tautore has turned out, what I always suspected he would. Mr. Busby is very well—but <hi rend="italic">low spirited</hi>. His cattle sale, the other day, was a very dead one. His largest fat bullocks only realized £10—cows, £5.10.—bulls and steers, £4 to £6, ewe lambs 4/- each and so on—about £100 pound’s worth only was sold. I hear that John Busby is quite sick of the Natives at Kaitaia—I told him how it would be, before he went,</p>
         <p>       Once more, my dear friend,</p>
         <p>               Believe me, very truly yours</p>
         <p>                       W. Colenso.</p>
