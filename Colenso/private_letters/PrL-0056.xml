         <p>The Right Rev.<lb/>Bishop of New Zealand.</p>
         <p rend="end">Te Kopi, Nov. 19, 1845.</p>
         <p>My Lord,</p>
         <p>On reaching this village a fortnight ago, I received from the Christian Natives a long account of certain charges preferred against me, and of bad language spoken of me, by several whites residing in the valley of Wairarapa: of this, however, I should not have taken any notice—being pretty well used to such treatment—had not the Revd. Messrs. Hadfield and Cole also informed me that certain evil reports had reached them; and, when dining at Mr. St. Hill’s with Major Richmond, His Honor the Superintendent told me, he had been applied to upon the subject, and had written to me a Letter— “as a friend”—to inform me of it. The charges, as far as I can make them out, appear to be, to the effect, that I had recommended the Natives to rise against the Whites, and to drive them from Wairarapa; that I had said, “They were all evil persons—<hi rend="italic">taurakareka’s </hi>(slaves)—&amp;c., &amp;c.—<hi rend="italic">ad infin</hi>.—</p>
         <p>On my return, yesterday, with Archdeacon Williams to this place—our intention was to have gone to see some of those Europeans, but—our being already behind time—they at some distance from us in a <hi rend="italic">contrary </hi>direction, and we tired with a long journey before us—and your Lordship’s speedy coming into our respective Districts for the purpose of holding Confirmations—make us desirous of proceeding onwards to our Stations without loss of time.</p>
         <p>I have, however, my Lord, written a Letter to the nearest resident Europeans, a Copy of which I enclose.</p>
         <p>It is scarcely needful for me to add, that I am utterly ignorant of those things so laid to my charge, and that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Natives of the valley with whom I have conversed appear to be equally ignorant as to the person or persons with whom such accounts could possibly have originated.—</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>my Lord,</p>
         <p>Your most obedient Servt.,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
