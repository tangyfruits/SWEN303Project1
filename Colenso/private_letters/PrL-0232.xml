         <p rend="end">Saturday morning</p>
         <p>His Honour</p>
         <p>D.McLean Esq.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I return your Papers, so very kindly lent me, with many thanks. I have read Fox’s long speech (which so reminds me of him, and of some of his sarcastic speeches in “the House”!)—and think he is right in some parts of it, as to Natives’ Rights, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>Have you seen T. Williams’ speech? If not I can lend you the “Evening Post,” which contains it. I think the whole trial should be printed in a pamphlet—I have not seen the evidence.</p>
         <p>I am glad to find you liked the “Starling.” Did you ever read “Dean Ramsay’s Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character”? If you have <hi rend="italic">not­</hi>—you will (I think) like it much. I have it &amp; should be happy to send it to you.—</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso.</p>
         <p>Read Sewell’s letter on the Consolidated Loans, &amp;c,—it is in the “Canterbury Times” of April 25—now returned. W.C.</p>
