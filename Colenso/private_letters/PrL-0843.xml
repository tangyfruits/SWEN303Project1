         <p rend="end">Dannevirke, Augt. 30. 1892</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Again am writing to you! to thank you for yours of 28<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., just to hand; and <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, to let you know, I am delighted to read your <hi rend="italic">graphical </hi>account of your late meeting (would that I had been there!) I am also very pleased at your thinking of coming out on the Moa question. Do so: you have hit rightly, that <hi rend="italic">long </hi>(&amp; valuable) rhapsody of the ½-drowning Mau Paikea (that gave me so much trouble in translating <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> its notes)—will prove of <hi rend="italic">service hereafter</hi>—w. <hi rend="italic">many more of those </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">ancient</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> E. Coast legends</hi>, &amp;c.—the no. would have been largely increased, but for <hi rend="underline italic">Holden</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Weber</hi>, and their too facile tool Locke:—I have ever felt that!—</p>
         <p>Depend upon it, Buller is <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>trustworthy in those old matters.—I could give you <hi rend="italic">good</hi> reasons for this. Read again those <hi rend="italic">old </hi>stories of big saurians! every circumstance as if <hi rend="italic">really true. </hi>Then, bear in mind that in the thirties, we always had at our Missn. Station in the Bay (Paihia) Maoris from all parts of N. Island, learning to read, in our (or my) day school and often at night—night school (as I thirsted to know Maori—from various tribes:) these were always going &amp; coming, &amp; <hi rend="italic">many </hi>letters I wrote by them. These <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> pictures of Ostrich, Emu, &amp;c. in my Rees’ Cyclop., bot. mag. &amp; other works: heard from me the var. tales of them, running, <hi rend="italic">kicking</hi>, &amp;c—&amp;, as a matter of notoriety, on returning E.W.N. &amp; South, carried off such—with <hi rend="italic">embellishments</hi>! much of <hi rend="italic">that </hi>is the <hi rend="italic">foundation</hi> of McD’s., J. White’s, Sir W.B’s., &amp; other stories <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Moa: once more, before you take up pen—read what I have <hi rend="italic">painfully </hi>collected &amp; written on subject.—– </p>
         <p>Buller, Grey, Hector, Travers, &amp; Taylor White, &amp; J.Wh. all sought informn. to strengthen &amp; vamp up <hi rend="italic">their preconceived </hi>notions! just as Rev. R. Taylor did.!!You surprise me in saying,—“Haast &amp; <hi rend="italic">30,000</hi> years”!!!Moreover, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>this transln. of Quatrefages: did I ever tell you, that Haast shortly before he went to Engd. wrote to me about Q’s. papers (<hi rend="italic">perhaps not these</hi>?) asking me if I would join him in rebutting them? I said, “Did not know them.” Haast sent them, pubd. in Lond. Mag. Zool. &amp; Boty.—I agreed: H. went to Engd. I sent for those nos. have ’em now. H. returned &amp; <hi rend="italic">died</hi>: so I never used them: but I was struck w. Q. <hi rend="italic">dishonesty</hi>! he had <hi rend="italic">evidently </hi>seen my last &amp; most exhaustive p. on Moa,—had culled bits here &amp; there to suit, &amp; <hi rend="italic">ignored </hi>the rest!! I may yet do a little, w. Haast’s letters &amp;c, as a preface.<note xml:id="ftn3-609" place="foot" n="609"> He did so: Colenso W. 1893. Notes and observations on M. A. de Quatrefages’s paper on “Moas and Moa Hunters.” <hi rend="italic">Trans. N.Z. Inst.</hi> 26: 498–513.</note> I do not swallow Tregear’s <hi rend="italic">cock </hi>story! any more than his <hi rend="italic">cow </hi>one!!——I enclose Chapman’s letter—which I have had to <hi rend="italic">disinter</hi>! (return anon.) He says—<hi rend="italic">of me</hi>—“You were far more qualified but had not done it”: at all events C. has <hi rend="italic">cut me out</hi>: I have been for yrs. collecting, &amp; was about to write my paper (<hi rend="italic">as Hamiltion knew</hi>), but not now: C. <hi rend="italic">has used some of my “finds” </hi>(second-hand, perhaps). Thanks for <hi rend="italic">Fungus</hi>.</p>
         <p>Now myself: 1. Rain, ever &amp; always! 2. at Wdv. on Sunday to preach <hi rend="italic">last </hi>S.—but a wire from Bp. <hi rend="italic">not to do so</hi>—to see him, &amp;c. 3. Returned yesty. 4. on Saty. to Waipawa for Services <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, that E. may go to Wdv. 5. Tuesday to N. 6. on 12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. to read my <hi rend="italic">poor </hi>p. (Jottings, No.2) hope it may <hi rend="italic">not </hi>be required.<note xml:id="ftn3-610" place="foot" n="610"> It <hi rend="underline">was</hi> required: Colenso W. 1892 Bush jottings: No. 2 (Botanical). <hi rend="italic">Trans NZ Inst</hi>. 25: 307–319. Read before the Hawke’s Bay Philosophical Institute, 12th September, 1892.</note> 7. I <hi rend="italic">may </hi>come back to Bush on (say) 19<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>: have got Rheumatism hand &amp; arm, write badly &amp; in pain. Paper says, Hill gave on Sy. aftn. last, Lect. to Sy. Sch., Waipawa— “The way to Heaven.” </p>
         <p>Kindest regards to you</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Heard that Chapman had <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than 100 copies!!</p>
