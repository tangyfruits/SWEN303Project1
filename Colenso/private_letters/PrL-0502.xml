         <p rend="end">Napier, May 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1882</p>
         <p>Mr John Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I duly received your letter of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and thank you for it.</p>
         <p>I was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so successful in the 70 mile Bush as I should have been, owing to the rain. Out of ten days there, 7 were rainy!! However, I al­ways manage to do <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, &amp; so, while shut up there, I wrote my paper which I read at the meeting; the weather has been fine generally, out here ever since—as indeed, I had both supposed it would, and told them it would be, for I mostly find <hi rend="italic">May</hi> fine <hi rend="italic">to the end;</hi> formally it was my tra­velling month—that to April.</p>
         <p>As to Moths, “Ant Lions”, perfect insects, &amp;c, you will do nothing till Summer comes round again. I fancy Smith must have made a mistake in saying, such were plentiful, or found, at Napier; it may be so but I have never seen them.­</p>
         <p>Mr Hardy called on Friday last and brought a few specimens, but no­thing new. I hope our <hi rend="italic">new Vols</hi> may be here soon; I know that now there are so <hi rend="italic">many</hi> members, the <hi rend="italic">Binding</hi> (poor work though it is) takes a long time.—I sent you a Paper or two last week, &amp; hope to send you some more ere long; though old, there is generally some <hi rend="italic">good reading</hi> in them; and <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of other kinds; Such a contrast to our locals; though the D.T. does contain <hi rend="italic">more</hi> miscellaneous reading, &amp; better too, than the others.</p>
         <p>Mentioning Papers, one thing in particular made us laugh, aye and re­gret to see it<hi rend="sup"> </hi>too, viz, the cheekiness, or bounce, of the Waipawa Mail; in offering <hi rend="italic">it</hi> as a <hi rend="italic">special</hi> prize to the winner of the Champion (£10) tomorrow. Why, what is its value? (monetary I mean); Would anyone give two bob for it?—just 2d a week (at the very <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> price of our big­ger &amp; better papers)—and wait twelve months and a day for the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>!! Then, those ploughmen, mostly, I suppose, from farms and stations, with no mail to their homes; <hi rend="italic">how</hi> are they to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> this precious Special Prize even if the Co pays the postage, which I doubt. The thing is so ridi­culous as to have made much mockery, and were it not for the cause of encouraging ploughing—there would have been something written about it, and may be yet. To me, it has a <hi rend="italic">lowering</hi> tendency; I hope, however, it will not have that effect! The Committee, whoever they are, are to blame for allowing such a mean &amp; paltry thing to be entered (and No 1 too as a <hi rend="italic">Sp Prize</hi>). I suppose you will be at the match tomorrow, as it is pretty near you; I hope the weather may prove fine; the ground must be in excellent order now.</p>
         <p>With you, I am pleased with this substitution of <hi rend="italic">inanimate</hi> glass balls for <hi rend="italic">living</hi> &amp; kicking<hi rend="sup">-</hi>pigeons; I hope it may become universal.</p>
         <p>I was pleased to find you were <hi rend="italic">all well.</hi> We have had several Deaths of late. I was in town <hi rend="italic">once</hi> last week, &amp; may go again once this week.</p>
         <p>I am pretty well, and with kind remembrances to <hi rend="italic">all</hi>;</p>
         <p>Believe me, yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso,</p>
