         <p>Decr. 29 1870</p>
         <p>Hon. D. McLean</p>

         <p>Wellington</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yesterday I received a painful letter from Capt. Curling—he has no aid from home, and he wishes now to leave by “Maggie” for Sydney, “if his friends can raise the passage-money and a few pounds in his pocket on landing”. I therefore venture to trouble you with this, for your mite. Although little can be said in the poor fellow’s favor, I trust that you (for “auld lang syne”) will consider it an act of real charity—to help him in his distress. It is not much that is wanted, yet it falls <hi rend="italic">on us </hi>(as I experimentally know,) at any but a good time.—</p>
         <p>I hope you are well; and that you will forgive my thus intruding on you.—</p>
         <p>And heartily wishing you a happy new year I am</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I fear you will not be in time to answer by post—but if you should be willing to help, &amp; would telegraph—“Yes &amp; <hi rend="italic">sum</hi>,” that would do.—</p>
         <p>Would you kindly mention it to Mr George Cooper? W.C.</p>
