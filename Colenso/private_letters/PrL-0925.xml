         <p>Mr. Hans Mortensen,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>At last! I am able to up anchor and sail. I purpose leaving here tomorrow for Dannevirke (I have to hold Divine Service in the English Church there next Sunday, that Mr. Robertshawe may go to Weber District,) and my present plan is, to be at Makotuku, at Davis’s, on Tuesday evening, and <hi rend="italic">to drive to Norsewood on Wednesday morning</hi>, weather permitting, and should it be wet on that day, then on the first fine day after: and as Olsen’s house is on the way to you, I shall stop there a while, before I go on to your place. Olsen was here last week with his son, and he told me that Davis has a buggy and horse, so this will suit me very well. I shall write a note from Dannevirke to Davis, to secure a bed there.—–</p>
         <p>I hope that you are all well and that I may find you so, and with kind regards to you, &amp; to all friends, I am, Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Let Axel know of this.</p>
