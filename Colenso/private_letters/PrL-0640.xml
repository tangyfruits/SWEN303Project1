         <p>My dear Son Willie,</p>
         <p>As a true sailor, you well-know what it is to prepare in time for the coming storm: a ship that is well-handled, and made all snug aloft and below, meets and passes through the trial and danger bravely. Just so it must be with you, (<hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, and not having me by your side,) to prepare yourself for what I have written specially for you in these pages, for you will find many ugly and disagreeable things concerning <hi rend="italic">us</hi> (both you &amp; me) in them.—I have long hesitated <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> them down, as I would much rather have <hi rend="italic">told</hi> you of them,—<hi rend="italic">explaining them as I went along</hi>: but, as I have always thought that <hi rend="italic">you ought to know</hi> of them, (although such knowledge will give you pain,) and as my days are now fast running to an end, I have no longer deferred writing. Do not grieve too much over what you may herein read. Nobly share with me, my son, in my long and heavy trials;—not a few of them were increased and willingly borne on your account. But it would require many words to give you a correct outline of the <hi rend="italic">many strange</hi> and <hi rend="italic">false</hi> charges I have had to meet, and <hi rend="italic">to bear</hi>. One was, that I had turned Mrs. Colenso out of doors:—another, that I was living disreputably with Maori women; another, that I was a confirmed drunkard, and common card-player with the lowest of the whites:—another, that I was unfit to be the trustee of my own 2 children, (and this last abominable story was even <hi rend="italic">sworn to</hi>! in the Supreme Court at Auckland):—and there are many other heavy charges, but I have never cared to answer them, <hi rend="italic">I have lived them down</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Do not allow any one to read this portion (parts III. and IV.) of the Ms., keep it to yourself:—but <hi rend="italic">after our deaths</hi>, it should, I think, belong to the family there in Penzance. Latimer, I suppose will come in for the copy of it (or the original papers) here.</p>
         <p>You are of mature age now; read it <hi rend="italic">slowly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thoughtfully</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">note down any questions you may wish to ask me</hi> concerning the same:—also, respecting the two other parts (I. and II.)—<hi rend="italic">these two</hi> I should like for Sarah’s mother to read, (also, her father, if you approve of it,) and Mrs. Tucker, should you have the opportunity of her doing so.—In truth, I had promised their perusal to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, some time ago.—</p>
