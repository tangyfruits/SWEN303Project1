         <p rend="end">Paihia, Bay of Islands,<lb/>New Zealand, Jany. 15, 1841.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs</p>
         <p>1. My last Letter to you, via Sydney, which I trust you have received, was dated August 27/40. It was a request for a supply of Printing Paper, of which Article we were then nearly in want. The New Zealand Auxiliary Religious Tract Society has kindly lent us a few Reams; this will keep our Press a-going for some little time.—</p>
         <p>2. A vessel being about to sail for England, affords me the opportunity of reporting the progress of your Press in New Zealand, during the last 12 months. I hope the accounts enclosed, of work done and Issues made, will prove satisfactory. I have been obliged, almost necessarily so, to do a little printing for His Excellency, the Lieut. Governor. A few copies of different proclamations, &amp;c, done by me for him, you have here enclosed. You will, also, find Copies of the Psalms, which I have also been privileged with the editing and Printing of,—of the Catechisms, edited by Revd. W. Williams,—of part of Daniel and the Book of Jonah, which I have been enabled to translate,—and a kind of Almanack, for the present year, calculated &amp; written by myself. The Copies of Psalms which are bound in Black Cloth, shews the manner in which we shall bind them for the Natives.We have not yet been able to get any bound for distribution among them; some, however, I am happy to say, are now in a course of Binding. The 3 parts of the New Testament sent, are merely intended to shew how we intend sending out the few Testaments we have remaining. We are at present going on with the Prayer Book; and (the Psalms being finished,) are advanced in the Collects, Epistles &amp; Gospels, to “the Gospel for the Monday before Easter”. This Book has advanced but slowly, but, by <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> blessing, we shall get it done in time.—</p>
         <p>3. I also enclose copies of 2 Tracts in the New Zealand language, against the errors of Rome. They were refused permission to be printed at your Press here, (the person I can not now exactly state,) but, through the <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>kindness of Mr. Busby, and others, <hi rend="italic">out of the Mission</hi>, (who advanced the money for the purpose,) 8,000 copies were printed at Sydney and Hobart Town. I intended to have sent you a literal translation of them, and hope, “if the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> will,” soon to do so, that you may be the better enabled to judge of their tendency. In the absence, however, of a Translation, you may form some idea of their real Character, from learning that they have all been disposed of, at 12/- pr. Hundred, as follows:—<lb/>To S.D. Committee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,000 copies<lb/>To Wesleyan Missy. Committee . . . . . . . 4,000 copies<lb/>To N.Z. Auxy. R. Tract Society  . . . . . . . 1,400 copies, and<lb/>To Revd. R. Maunsell, and Revd. R. Taylor, and Messrs Baker, Kemp, Shepherd, Matthews, Puckey, Ashwell, and others in the Mission, and J. Busby, Esqr., Mr. Mair, and others out of the Mission, the remainder. For want of funds my Ms. was obliged to be considerably curtailed. These Tracts contain an exposition of 12 only of their errors; whereas my Ms. contained 19.—I hope, by and bye, to be enabled to get it all printed.—</p>
         <p>4. In March last, the printing-press was removed from the room which it had occupied in Mr. Baker’s House in this settlement, to the unfinished Stone House, erected by Rev. W. Williams, in which I have always resided. This was done merely as a temporary measure: as Mr. Baker was about removing to Waikare, and His Excellency the Lieut. Governor was waiting to take up his abode in Mr. Baker’s House, the same having been let to him. I hope before this reach you, to receive your Committee’s determination relative to the final location of the Press.—</p>
         <p>5. During the past year I have only been able to make <hi rend="italic">one</hi> journey among the Natives, through having so very much to do at home. On the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. April, I left the Station, on a visit to the Natives in Wangarei and neighbourhood; we went overland, and returned by the same route on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., experiencing very bad weather. I fear that I shall not possibly be able to give much time to journeying during the ensuing year. I live, however, in hope of better days, but of this I must not—dare not—assure myself.—<hi rend="bold">[3]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>6. The Committee of Missionaries were pleased, in August last, to appoint me to the office of Sub-Editor and Superintendent of the Press; and also, in consequence of the great rise in the price of every necessary, to make some trifling addition to my Salary. Of those Resolutions of theirs, you have, doubtless, been made acquainted.—</p>
         <p>7. There has been much more work done in the Binding- and Printing-office, than what is actually shewn in the Returns. Natives’ old books, rebound and repaired; small Books folded and stitched; &amp;c, &amp;c, have taken up no small portion of my time. I wish to be found every year increasingly abundant in labour, but, I have a presentiment, that I shall never do such another year’s work for the C.M.S., if at all, again, on earth. My own head and fingers, through <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> blessing, have done all—in translating, copying, editing, compositing, reading, correcting, revising, folding, warehousing, packing, &amp;c, &amp;c,—yet this is but a portion of my present labour in N. Zealand. And though I have had enemies, neither few nor small, to contend with, praise be <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>! I can do <hi rend="italic">all </hi>things through Christ strengthening me.—This makes a poor heart glad in the midst of all my toils; yea, and therefore I will rejoice, for <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">is </hi>with me!</p>
         <p>8. You will, I dare say, hear, of numbers who have been baptized, &amp;c, &amp;c,—would that you could hear of a tithe of them—in point of numbers—who were bringing forth the Fruits inseparable from a living Faith.—It is a sad and awful subject for reflection: yet I fear that it is generally the case, that vital godliness, <hi rend="italic">heart </hi>religion, is little, if at all, known among the Natives of New Zealand. For, notwithstanding the extended increase of knowledge among them and also the great addition to the number of professing Christians, their besetting sins of Avarice, deceit, laziness, and ingratitude, appear to be daily gaining ground upon them: of course, I speak only of Natives who profess to have embraced the Christian Faith. Of all that I have seen published about the Natives of this country, I think that the account given by His Lordship the Bishop of Australia was nearest the truth. His Lordship’s <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>remarks were quite correct so far as he knew, but were he acquainted with all—the little every-day occurrences of life which shews the man—I dare to think, he would not have written any thing near so favorably of them as he did.</p>
         <p>9. The Residents, Emigrants, &amp; others in this Country, are all, more or less, in a ferment, about the Land, and the “Land Question”. The Commissioners are soon to sit, shortly after which, it is to be hoped, for the peace and welfare of the Country, things will assume a more flourishing and placid aspect. The present Government cannot please all parties, and, consequently, is not liked. I think it almost a sign that we are indeed living in the “latter days,” when I perceive, even here at the Antipodes, the same anarchical, ultra-republican spirit, which appears to have pretty nearly circumambulated with rapid strides the whole globe. Surely the times, spoken of by the inspired Apostles Peter and Paul, (2 Peter, II, 2 Tim. III, &amp;c.) are come, or, at all events, at hand! Oh! may I, seeing the error of the wicked, and experimentally knowing that I have the roots of the same evil in my own heart, be enabled to cleave the closer to Christ: thus, shall I be preserved from falling.—</p>
         <p>10. It is not my intention, my dear Sirs, to say much about passing events, numerous, new, and strange, as they are. But, I think, I may in all truth say, that, the words of God,—my own heart,—the temptations of the world and the Devil—the spiritual wants of the Natives—and six years’ residence in the New Zealand Missionary field, all, all combine in assuring me, that it is almost a matter of Impossibility for a man to be a Missionary among the Heathen and a possessor of Lands and Cattle, &amp;c, &amp;c, <hi rend="italic">the same having to be looked after or attended to, in any way, by himself</hi>. Wealth, even in civilized countries, has generally Care, if not Pride also, in his train; and Care too often brings Anxiety, Self, Parsimony, Avarice, &amp;c, &amp;c, <hi rend="italic">ad infin.</hi>;—if it be so, how much more is it to be expected that such is the case in uncivilized lands, where moral restriction exists not? I most willingly acknowledge and <hi rend="bold">[5]</hi> firmly believe, that a man, abounding in possessions, and flocks, and herds, may, by the Grace of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, become a useful settler in a Heathen Land, and may be of great utility in the little circle around about him. But even this is by no means an easy thing in a Land like this; where the Natives (supposing them to be, in part at least, his workmen,) unused to constant labour, would very soon perceive that they were working for their employer’s profit; which alone, among this suspicious people, would be quite sufficient to neutralize all the efforts he might make for their spiritual welfare. Were, however, such a Settler <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to employ Natives as Laborers, the constant trespassing of Cattle on their plantations, would alone prove a fruitful and never-failing source of discontent, bickering, and quarrelling: for the Natives, from never manuring their ground, only plant one or two, or at most three of four years in one place; hence their cultivated lands are seldom fenced in; and hence, also, the continual inroad of the Cattle of “the Stranger” on their little all. And then, (to place the case in a more favorable point of view,) if we suppose such a settler possessed of a “Cattle run,” (as is, perhaps, the case with some,) large enough to allow his Herds full liberty of roaming hither and thither in search of food, without at all coming near any Native Cultivations; yet, even in this case, there would be often heard, some such expressions as— “You have got all our best land—You have got the Lands of our Fathers—You have got our Lands for nothing—Our Fathers foolishly sold their Lands to you—You, who profess to have come hither for our interest, have taken advantage of our ignorance—You coaxed them to part with their Lands, when they said, No, No, &amp;c, &amp;c,”—which, as I before observed, would, to say the least of it, have a tendency to destroy all such a person’s exertions for their spiritual good; however disinterestedly he might endeavor to act in the matter. Oh! that the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>, who has hitherto graciously kept me from this snare, would mercifully vouchsafe to waken me every <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>morning, with, “Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world, &amp;c”.—</p>
         <p>11. The following is a List of Books, &amp;c, now sent, in a parcel, pr. this vessel, “the Mars”:—<lb/>4 Copies Psalms of David,<lb/>6 ditto ditto, with morning &amp; evening Service of our <lb/>  church, and Hymns,<lb/>10 ditto Daniel and Jonah,<lb/>6 Almanacks,<lb/>3 parts of Testament,<lb/>Sundry papers printed for H.M. Government in New <lb/>  Zealand,<lb/>3 Copies of an Exposition of the Errors of Rome, part I.,<lb/>3  ditto              ditto            ditto  part II.,<lb/>Returns of Books printed, and Issued, and of Books <lb/>  bound, for the year 1840,<lb/>  and, a small parcel, enclosed, for Mr. Broughton.</p>
         <p>12. The Romish leaven is, I fear, slowly spreading amongst the people. The RC. Bishop, Jesuit-like, grasps at every thing that presents itself in the manner and acting of your Society’s labourers, which he thinks may be advantageously urged against the Protestant Cause. He has, I fear, through his specious plausibility, made also successful use of the Holding of Land by the Missionaries, against the Cause of Christ in New Zealand. And, as the Natives become more and more oppressed by the continual arrival of the “White Man” among them, so will Rome, unless <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> prevent, too fatally succeed through her insidious and wily accusations against the Protestant Missionaries. Their Priests now are scattered in different parts of the Northern Island; two, also, are in the Middle Island; and the R.C. Bishop is now absent, in his Brig which he has purchased, on “an Apostolical tour” (? voyage) to the principal Islands of the S. Pacific. Unfortunately (thinking as I do, I make use of this term,) the Brethren <hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>speak of Rome’s exertions in New Zealand, as “a mere nothing”—or, suppose that, “the New Zealanders have too much good sense to listen to Rome”—or, that, “’tis only the last throes of the beast.” It may be so, and I would hope that it is really so, but I would say, as a Christian Soldier—enlisted under the Great Captain of our Salvation, and bearing in mind my Baptismal Vow, “manfully to fight under His banner, against sin, the World, and the Devil; and to continue Christ’s faithful soldier and Servant unto my life’s end”—never to drop the 2-edged sword which He has so entrusted me with, until either the enemy had quitted the field, or my Master had called me home. May <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> grant that when <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> shall be pleased to call me, I may be found in the Van of Battle, having my armour on!</p>
         <p>13. In conclusion, my dear Sirs, (hoping soon to hear from you, in answer to mine of Jany./40.) I pray you to pardon all that may <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> to be amiss in this Communication of mine. And, praying that <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi>, whose name is “Faithful and True,” and who delights in “Keeping mercy for thousands,” and in fulfilling His most gracious promises, may mercifully vouchsafe unto us <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, that as our day so our strength shall be—</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>Dear Sirs,</p>
         <p> very faithfully yours</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
