         <p rend="end">1854.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Elizabeth Colenso,<lb/>  Otahuhu, near Auckland.</p>
         <p>My dear Elizabeth,</p>
         <p>Your note, dated Feby. 19th., last, per Mr. Alexander, I received a few days ago; and now that the little Auckland vessel, in which he came to Ahuriri, is about returning, I must endeavour to answer it. The other note (of which you speak, as having been sent by Mr. Hamlin) dated December 21st., I only received a day or two before the arrival of this—its counterpart. So that more than 5 long months had passed from your leaving Wairoa before I even heard from you at all, and then your two notes (especially your last) are written in such a way as even to make unpalatable the long anticipated feast.</p>
         <p>I own that I am quite at a loss to account for your new mode of acting: that is, when I remember how often you spoke about writing fully to me concerning the 2 dear children; (you yourself having tasted a little of the miserable state of uncertainty when here;) and, also, how often you declared what a good child you would train Wi to be &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>, Elizabeth, bring myself to believe that all this was said by you as mere patipatu; for all your notes from Te Wairoa bear testimony to your correct feeling in this matter. In your <hi rend="italic">last</hi> note (Feby. 19) written 2 full months after the former one, you do not ever once allude to Fanny or Latty; so that, had not Mr. Hamlin kindly informed me concerning them, I should not have known of their being alive! And then, as to <hi rend="italic">Wi</hi>: Oh! how you have been drawn aside to falsify your <hi rend="italic">solemnly pledged</hi> word—and that pledge too, often made by you a matter of prayer to God, as well as <hi rend="italic">repeatedly</hi> given. I knew (alas! too well) how lightly you considered certain oaths and promises; and I have seen, (to my grief) that you were confirmed in that opinion from what you had heard here from our superiors. Still, I <hi rend="italic">did believe</hi>, that you really loved Wi, and believing this, I knew that it would enable you to overcome all opposition—even supposing that your belief in the religious part of your promises concerning the child might be shaken through the plausibleness or number of your friends, especially if dressed in the garb of religion.</p>
         <p>Yes, Elizabeth, I did believe this, and this was my <hi rend="italic">only</hi> earthly stay during the first few months of my melancholy life. It is true, that my belief in your affection for the child received a shock when I was so suddenly summoned to go immediately to Te Wairoa to bring him back; but even then I did not fully give way—as I had not received any letter from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to do so; and when I found at Moeangiangi your letter per Ihaka (assuring me of your being confirmed in your love &amp;c. towards the child, and desiring me to return) I rejoiced and gave God thanks that He had again enabled you to do what was right for the poor orphan; and again believed you, aye, more than ever. And here, perhaps, you will allow me to refresh your memory with a few sentences from your last letter from Te Wairoa: in yours of Sept. 24th., (after mentioning all about Mr. Grace and others who had endeavoured to prevail upon you to abandon the child) you say, “Do not make yourself uneasy about <hi rend="italic">Wi</hi>: I shall not alter my conduct towards him, let people say what they will. Dear little Wi is now asleep in his crib. I did not know how much I loved him till after I had written that letter for you to come to fetch him and then the thought of parting with him often made the tears start into my eyes. I did not feel comfortable not being sure that I had done right in so writing; and when the messenger acted as he did with the letters, I felt as though it were a sign, a “tohu” that Wi was to go on with me. I prayed often to be directed aright in the matter. If the vessel comes in, the “Eliza” or “Antelope” I shall, please God, go by the first, taking Wi with me, of course.” In yours of 27th. Septr. you say— “My dearest William—Do not come on for Wi, or send for him. <hi rend="italic">I cannot part with him</hi>. If you are on your way, <hi rend="italic">return</hi>.... I feared the child being taken from me and sent back by a native, but on considering it afterwards I thought it could not be done unless <hi rend="italic">I</hi> consented, and that I never could do.” (The underlinings are all your own). Here, then, Elizabeth, are two things painfully apparent; (that is on the face of your last 2 notes) your wonderful alteration for the worse towards the child and myself. I am sure the conduct of the child could not have been a means of your so altering towards him; and I am equally at a loss to know in what way I have subsequently offended you. God is my witness—and there are living human witnesses hereto, (Roka, Matisha, and others)—and I cannot but suppose that my long letters to you by every opportunity, and my little diligent works for you all (both those sent, and these here, now some time ready to go) would all testify—<hi rend="italic">that it has long been my chief delight to be doing something for you and the children</hi>. Had you, Elizabeth, left this place in a hurry 2 years ago,—or, had you not known all (and a vast deal more than all, which I have never cared to deny) concerning me before you left, I then could see a reason for your so sadly and so soon altering towards us; but such is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the case. I warned you, Elizabeth, to beware of your counsellors—more especially of that of the men of the world,—most so of that of the pseudo-religious world of the day. I earnestly besought you <hi rend="italic">to be guided by the word of God alone. </hi>That you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> done so, your note is sufficient proof. You tell me, in your note, what some say respecting the likeness of Wi to Hamuera. Is this new? Did we not often say as much? It would be vastly more wonderful if there were no resemblance. The <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> is as old as the days of Jacob, at least, who artfully contrived and succeeded; and if you take the two children born nearest to us—Maora’s and Riria’s <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, you will again see it strongly exemplified: Maora’s resembling Mr. Keir, fair and <hi rend="italic">light</hi>-haired: (whereas Maora and her husband have jet-black hair and dark complexions, as you well know), and Riria’s quite a little mulatto, growing more and more so—the very image of Pompey the black—both parents being <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> natives. And then, again, look at Rebecca’s <hi rend="italic">second</hi> child; was it not the very miniature of the old chief Wi Tipuna? Even Hamuera saw the striking resemblance in the new-born and sickly infant, and the mother also acknowledged it. Dr. English (who has a tolerable share of practice and who often calls) told me, a few months ago, of the great difference between the skin of a native and that of a European or half-caste; a difference which exists even in their infants: the skin of the natives, old and young, quite turning the edge of his lancet, and sometimes being quite impenetrable. Now this, <hi rend="italic">we too</hi>, have seen; and Wi’s skin is, I believe, thinner than that of any child I have seen here. But I have a <hi rend="italic">more sure proof</hi>, and I, for my own part am satisfied. But, beyond all this, supposing (for argument’s sake) Wi to be Hamuera’s real child—should this make any difference now? You stood as his godmother when <hi rend="italic">you </hi>knew not but that he was Hamuera’s child; and, afterwards, you not only helped, but mainly assisted in retaining him (for so doing you shall ever have my hearty thanks) when, if he had been carried off, he perhaps would have died. And, again, when the Bishop was last here, had you not consented to bring him up, he would not (I suppose) have gone to the North. You alone knew what a fearful struggle took place that night, and mainly about the child. And you know what I said to you, and what <hi rend="italic">you answered</hi> in the last bitter hour of parting. Here is a soul born for eternity as the child is brought up so will he (humanly speaking) live and die. It is in our power (or rather it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> in mine—it is still, in some degree, in <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>) to do much for the child, and I, by God’s grace, will to the last do all I can. Do not, Elizabeth, do not act cruelly towards Wi—I mean, do not (after all your promises and prayers) leave him to be brought up a little Sabbath-breaker, as a little Heathen, never taught to pray. Doubtless you are (as you always were) very kind to your little nephews and nieces; but there cannot be any shadow of doubt that, <hi rend="italic">before God, the Church, and your own conscience</hi> little Wi has a higher and prior claim. You took him from us—from his mother—and you should (spite of all that your relations and friends can say) act a Mother’s part. If you do not, then I shall fear greatly for Latty and Fanny; for I have always seen through life <hi rend="italic">the evil harsh measure meted back.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>You tell me, moreover, that your father and your brothers would not allow the infant to enter their doors. This subject, you must recollect, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> had more than once talked over here. I knew, too well, the unkind ways of the world to suppose any other, unless the Grace of God. should have changed the hearts of those whom you were (then) soon to see: and this, I confess, I did not hope: and that, firstly, because your father had been considered to be a more strictly <hi rend="italic">Bible</hi> Christian than many Church of England men are, hence he had spoken of himself as a Dissenter: and, secondly, because your brother John, to whom I had spoken as a brother (when here) had shown a kind feeling towards the infant, and had even told me that “I should never want a home while he had one”, and then I believed in their affection for you, and I strengthened myself in yours for the child; and all combined, I dared to hope for the best—but have again been bitterly disappointed.</p>
         <p>However, viewing the whole matter as I do, I cannot see any way of excuse for you (before God) in casting-off the child. You were not so utterly dependent upon either your father or brothers as to cause you to do so. It has, however, proved your often-written and declared love for Wi. Suppose, for a moment (and do not be offended with me) suppose Wi was <hi rend="italic">your own</hi> son (like the case of M.D... at the North) and you gone to your family and had been so treated—how would you have acted?—even it you had not had a shilling in your pocket—would you have consented to the separation? I utterly renounce the idea: I feel assured you would never have done so.</p>
         <p>—A fire was once within my brain;<lb/>  And in my hand a dull, dull pain; <lb/>  But then there came a sight of joy, <lb/>  It came at once to do me good; <lb/>  I waked and saw my little boy,<lb/>  My little boy of flesh and blood;<lb/>  Oh joy for me that sight to see!<lb/>  For he was here, and only he.—</p>
         <p>I greatly wish you had told me more concerning this Henry Smith. Is he a religious man? Does he go with his family to any place of worship on the Sabbath-day? and, if so, to what denomination of Christians? Are his own little ones taught to pray &amp;c.—these are the principal things I am anxious to learn. I went purposely last week to Ahuriri (for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time since you left) to enquire of Mr. Alexander, but he could not satisfy me; and I have lately written to Mr. Hamlin to enquire of him. I have diligently considered the matter, according to what little information I have, and I cannot see that after all it will be for the child’s good to take him back just now. I am sure he is better away from these parts that he may learn the English tongue, which will ever be a taonga to him; and could I but know of his being with a pious and kind person, I should be comparatively happy. I gladly consent to pay the £12 per ann. to you for him (although I hardly know at present how I am to do so) which I hope to make, at least, £16 yearly, and which sum £16 or more) I intend to send to you by next vessel—if soon—or by way of Wellington. Mr. Alexander tells me that he hopes to have a vessel regularly trading to and from Auckland; and he has promised me a draft on his agent there. I did think of writing a note to this Henry Smith, but on second thoughts I considered it better to wait until I should hear from you again, which I hope soon to do. You have desired me <hi rend="italic">not </hi>to send you anything more; and you <hi rend="italic">may </hi>soon add—not to write you anything more; which, however, I hope you will not do. If Henry Smith is a man of no religion, and you could remove Wi to a better place (in this respect) do so. What is the Wesleyan Institution, where I hear there are children? Could you not enquire through your friend, Mrs White?</p>
         <p>As you do not say a word about the 2 children in your note, so you say not a word about yourself. And I cannot gather from the few lines you have written that you are comfortable. You went, Elizabeth, seeking happiness; and I sincerely hope you have found it; but, somehow, I question it, as such is only found in the path of duty; which, I fear, you are scarcely now in.</p>
         <p>I wrote you a note last month by Powhatu, which I suppose you have received. For very shame I dare not tell the natives here of your having written, and not a word about Fanny and Latty, and Wi cast away! We (Roka, Wiki and myself) worked hard in picking and preserving raspberries and gooseberries, and in drying Inangas, for you all:—but now, alas!—</p>
         <p>I hoped that the C.M.S. would allow the 2 children’s schooling, and they <hi rend="italic">may</hi> yet do so: if not, I shall not be able to pay for it, unless I sell off the few head of cattle. I am now doing nothing in the way of getting a livelihood; and through your putting Wi out to board &amp;c. the following sums must be yearly forthcoming:—Wi, say, £16, Matiaha £12, self, say £20 = £48. I shall live as low as possible; and if C.M.S. will pay the children’s schooling, I hope to be able to do something for you, but I see no present prospect of funds sufficient to enable us to live separately. The butter here, this spring and autumn, would have been worth more than £30 had there been anyone to look after it. If I remain here another year, I intend (D.V.) to <hi rend="italic">sell </hi>the apples, instead of giving them away as I have done this year. Perhaps some <hi rend="italic">suitable</hi> situation may yet turn up for me in these parts, or elsewhere. I think that I told you of my having scraped up all the money I could and sent it to my London agent for goods, which may sell well here if he forwards them speedily. My times are, however, wholly in God’s hand. As for myself, I often wish for a <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> at hand, or a little <hi rend="italic">suitable</hi> society. I have not yet purchased any land; 3 small spots which I have selected (on the Coast) and wrote to Wellington to obtain, on my going to Mr. Domett the Land Commissioner I found that they were <hi rend="italic">all gone</hi>! But even in this, I think I see an over-ruling Providence; it may be that I shall never possess any land in New Zealand—and I am sure, except for a quiet residence, or for the children, I do not covet to do so.</p>
         <p>You tell me, in your first note, of my cousin being made a Bishop. The news was strange to my ears, and stranger still it appeared to me that <hi rend="italic">such</hi> information should have been written from <hi rend="italic">Otahuhu</hi>,—whence the letter to me before this one contained so much abuse of my family— who certainly never did the writer of that letter any injury—but so God brings things to pass.</p>
         <p>I have since heard that my cousin’s appointment is Port Natal on the African Coast and he may write to me to go thither to him. God may have more work for me to do yet in His Great Vineyard; and, if <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, He will again open the way for me, and again fit me for it.</p>
         <p>We have just had another taste of our old trouble, te Waipuke; and a heavier one than any, save the first great one. The water was 4 inches over the floor of school-room and store, and remained at its height a whole day and night. The Pakonoa natives worked hard (for their own sakes) in cutting through the bank, but did not succeed; it however burst and the waters drained off. This was on Thursday last, and it is still raining, it having commenced to rain on Wednesday the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>! We never saw the sea so greatly in upon us before; it came over the beach without breaking and not only into Waitangi River, but right across! so that I almost feared our houses would be washed away! The whole beach, I am sorry to say, is now flat, so that all Hawke’s Bay is open to view. I caught a very severe cold going about in the flood; the whole next day I could scarcely move, but am now a little better. An earthquake occurred on Friday night, a pretty strong one; and another last night, not quite so strong, both about midnight. A settler’s son, a boy about 10 years, was drowned at Waimarama last week, washed quite out of his neighbour’s hand in crossing the usually shallow river there! body not found. Henry Tomoana’s second wife is dead; ditto Te Wai: ditto Paora Torotoro’s child and some others. A native from Waipukurau stole my enamelled rice saucepan and a new pair of woollen trowsers (20/- value) from the store. I suspected someone from inland, and wrote a note to Hamuera, and through his searching it was found out. I have since been to the Magistrate about it, and also about Matiu Meke who seems to be really bursting with hatred &amp; malevolence against me; watching for, obtaining and opening all letters I may write to any native, no matter to whom, and having made their conents public (with his own additions) retains them! Matiu’s conduct is most insolent and unbearable; the respectable white settlers say: “If it was their case they would break his head with a stick”. The Magistrate told me I could proceed against him for felony, if I wished; I, however, have no wish to injure the poor creature, far from it; and the Magistrate has promised to write to him. Nearly all the whites blame me greatly for my lenity, saying that such conduct being not only mean, oft repeated, and felonious, but also unprovoked and ungrateful, ought not to be thus passed over, especially seeing that his own man (Kopakau’s brother-in-law) stole some things from this place; to which, no doubt, Matiu’s oft denouncing and abusing of me had in a measure prepared the way. I cannot, however, consent to harsh measures; (although I am aware that half-measures will never do any good with these natives) knowing, as I do, that Matiu has been led away through the teaching of his superiors; who too plainly taught these natives uncharitableness; and not only so, but what our Saviour prophesied— “<hi rend="italic">They shall put you out of the synagogue; yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doth God’s service.”</hi> (John XVI.2.) and the reason (verse 3)— “<hi rend="italic">These things will they do unto you because they have not known the Father nor me</hi>,” applies to both. Both parties being alike wilfufly ignorant of this truth,—that “<hi rend="italic">God is love</hi>” and “<hi rend="italic">Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi>” I do not mean to say that Matiu’s superiors taught him and others in words to act as he is now acting; but this is a necessary consequence therefrom. The New Zealanders are still children in many things, and like most children are great <hi rend="italic">imitators</hi>, so that to give them an inch, is the very sure way for them to take an ell—or, what is more likely, a fathom. One native has been publicly censured for sending here for a sheet of paper to write a letter; another (the chief Heta Tiki <hi rend="italic">staying here</hi>) for coming with my man Matiaha to prayers of a Sunday night; and another for buying articles here: but were I to give you all Matiaha’s freaks, I should fill a sheet. Let it suffice to say that Noah has (of himself) written against him.</p>
         <p>(<hi rend="italic">Tuesday 28</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>.) The rain still continues. Mr. S. Williams has been here, in this neighbourhood, about 10 days; but I only saw him casually when I was at Ahuriri, he then on his way to Tangoio. The state of the weather, and, above all, the mud and water everywhere about, <hi rend="italic">may </hi>have prevented his calling. I have, however, no wish to see him, unless he alters in his opinions concerning many matters. He has held service 2 Sundays following in the large Church here; the congregation, I believe, very small. The natives are getting into a sad state; <hi rend="italic">all hands </hi>becoming eager drunkards! Rum is now their daily delight!! which they get with impunity and will work for when nothing else will tempt them. Nor is it confined to the men—nor even the adults of both sexes. Mr. Fitzgerald told me the other day that there were not six sober natives in all the villages around Pakowhai! Two more licensed public houses are now set on at Ahuriri <hi rend="italic">on this side</hi> while “grog-shops” are everywhere. The natives ascribe their predilection for drink to Mr. McLean and the chief Wi Take (Mr. McLean’s companion from Wellington); and perhaps truly so. I did not know till lately that Mr. McLean gave Villers the orders to supply them with drink,—and again, lately, at Wellington: now I hear that the Ordinance has been rescinded by the Council at Wellington. Several settlers (of the older ones) have called to see me, and lamented the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> state of things among the natives. Mr. Fitzgerald said that it was perfectly useless now to attempt to do anything in a religious or moral way for these natives; that he never saw such a sudden alteration for the worse; and that he and others (who were ever interested in their welfare) now “looked upon them as a doomed race”! Reignier is gone to Whanganui, and it is said he intends leaving altogether. There are now a great number of whites in this neighbourhood, most of whom call and express themselves very kindly towards me, and also to the natives concerning me. Some ¼ acre allotments at Ahuriri <hi rend="italic">town</hi> are laid out, and will be soon offered for sale—beginning at Pukemokimoki on to Newton’s at Ouepoto, and some on the other side near Alexander’s in larger lots. Mr Domett has had his house at Ahuriri broken into, and an iron chest stolen and smashed open with an axe but the thieves got no money, still the robbery was a daring one: and a wheat mill is said to have been stolen from Ahuriri, for which Hamuera got suspected, but wrongfully, I fully believe. Still (as I told him) his conduct towards me—his living with that perjured man, Wi Tipuna, and “the well-known thief” Taare Hauaitu, will ever operate against him, I hear nothing of Rebecca, I believe she is quiet among her own people inland. Several of the natives are now absent at Te Wairoa, a tangihanga for Te Apatu. I am told it was a sad sight to see them at Ahuriri (they spent a night there on their way to Te Wairoa) all hands beastly drunk; women and girls, among whom was our Agnes!—insomuch that the whites who could do so all crossed over to the other side and there sat in the moonlight looking on! You will be glad to hear of my having made peace with Eruwini; he came, accompanied by Noah, in a very good frame to do so. I fear greatly that many natives have been lately partaking of the Lord’s Supper at Tangoio, Petane and here, who had far better been away, and that, too, with no previous notice! I had hard that Petane (ever very lax) had cast off <hi rend="italic">all</hi> karakia. Letters have come up from Hirini Tarahawaiki at Wairarapa to Noah and myself lamenting the sad alteration there; he says,— “This new minister comes often enough, and the Sacrament is given, but, alas! the words, the teaching, the love is all tangi kee,”—and much more of this nature. I feel more than ever strengthened in my belief that the settlers and the teachers will both see and bitterly regret their great error concerning me. “None but a Philistine will ever insult over a fallen Israelite” as Matthew Henry says;—he asks, “When were the Philistines of Gaza destroyed? It was when they were making sport with an Israelite &amp; insulting over him—persecuting him whom God hath smitten. Nothing fills the measure of the iniquity of any person or people faster than mocking or misusing the servants of God—yea, though it is by their own folly that they are brought low.” If you have his Commentary at hand, read his remarks on Samson, one of God’s worthies (Heb.XI). Every word that I have spoken God will assuredly bring to pass.</p>
         <p>(<hi rend="italic">Thursday, 30</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>.) Yesterday Mr. S. Williams called; talk general: he told me of sad drunkenness at Wairarapa, (where, according to the favourers of Dr. Pusey’s doctrines— “The due administration of the Sacrament was to fence <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the Church, and fence <hi rend="italic">out</hi> evil”!!!) Be well assured, Elizabeth, that nothing but the simple preaching of Scripture Truths—Justification by Faith alone—will ever be honoured by God the Holy Ghost. “The due administration of the Sacraments” (as it is called) by Mjnisters of <hi rend="italic">man’s sending</hi> are not of so much value to this people as Mr. Ready-to-halt’s crutches! Time will show the truth of my assertion.</p>
         <p>The Victerines &amp;c., of which you speak (in your note of December) I sent long ago with many things of my own (clothes, books, guns &amp;c.) to Wellington, and daily expect to receive an account of their sale. Provokingly enough, about a month back, Mere Hineitaka came with £10 to buy my fur cloak! I fear it will not have brought that price at Wellington. You speak also (in your last note) that “the 2 boxes had arrived at Auckland”. I fear that their contents will (through long keeping) prove both spoiled and of little use. No goods ever gave me (or us) greater labour and trouble than these two unfortunate packages. But, alas! we little thought that our labour of love would prove so unwelcome, so undesired. If you would like to have the preserves, &amp;c, &amp;c. sent, only say so, and I will be sure to send them. In doing so from this place to Auckland, I can pay the freight. The first lessons yesterday (Genesis 43–45) made me weep much: Jacob and Joseph and Benjamin—W.C., Latty &amp; W. Yet I, too, may have an unexpected and happy termination of my sad bereavements. My apples are now embittered with the drought, that the little darling gets <hi rend="italic">none</hi>! The big box wheat-mill I have just sold to Villers. Teretia has been here to me, to be paid for the little native clothing mat dear Fanny had on leaving; I supposed you had paid Ruanaganga for it; let me know when you write.</p>
         <p>I fully hoped to have letters from Fanny and Latty in answer to those I have written them. <hi rend="italic">Do not bring them up in undutifulness to their Father</hi>; unless you (also) say, they have none. But such vain thoughts will have no effect by-and-by after the mischief is done. You will know the very many threats in God’s word against this sin. <hi rend="italic">I cannot write to them now</hi>, as you have tied my hands but I shall write to them again (if I live) and they will ere long be able to judge for themselves, especially if God is pleased to grant them his Grace, to know their own hearts and His blessed truth.</p>
         <p>During my writing this long letter I have prayed <hi rend="italic">thrice</hi> specially not to write in bitterness, but in all truth; therefore be not needlessly offended if any portion should seem to be harsh.</p>
         <p>I daily pray for you <hi rend="italic">all </hi>by name, and<hi rend="italic"> </hi>shall never cease to do so. May God Almighty bless and counsel you, Elizabeth; may He also bless the 3 dear children now and evermore. Amen.</p>
         <p>                     So prays from his heart,</p>
         <p>                             Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                     William.</p>
