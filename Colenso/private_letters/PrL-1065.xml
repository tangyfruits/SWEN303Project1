         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand,<lb/>November 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1898.</p>
         <p>My dear Nephew William,</p>
         <p>I wrote to you last month, on 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., and I should not be writing to you again, now, were it not that I wish to fulfil my promise to you respecting Ellen, &amp; so this day I have been to our P.O. &amp; obtained the enclosed M.O. for £10.—<hi rend="italic">for her</hi>—but which you are to serve out, weekly &amp; proportionally, but this I leave to you: I did intend to send you a little more, but I cannot <hi rend="italic">well </hi>do so <hi rend="italic">just now</hi>—having so many <hi rend="italic">heavy </hi>calls to meet; taxes &amp; rates, &amp; <hi rend="italic">less money at hand, &amp; less coming in</hi>! I trust however to bear it in mind—for a future sending.</p>
         <p>I suppose the £<hi rend="italic">1000</hi>, sent to you &amp; Mr. Julyan last month, is nearing you by this time: I hope the War cloud as affecting <hi rend="italic">us</hi> will soon pass away and that you (all) residing on the immediate <hi rend="italic">coasts </hi>of England will be safe from all enemies. I have sent you a Paper, occasionally, but you can always see the file—or lot—I send monthly to the “Glen”—If you have time to look at them. I have been inland (100 miles) since my last, taking 2 Ch. Services in one day, &amp; though the weather was <hi rend="italic">dreadful</hi>, and I had to go 4 times, to &amp; fro Ch. to Vicarage, 1¼ miles each time in open buggy, &amp; could not show umbrella, yet I got through all <hi rend="italic">safely</hi>: praise <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>. I am keeping well: weather fine here: this is my Birth-day! a few kind friends have been remembering me. I hope you &amp; yours are all quite well. I cannot (must not) write you a long letter this time—having several to write. I wish you all— “A Happy New Year,” and many returns. And may <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>—our Hy. Father ever have you in His holy keeping. </p>
         <p>With much love Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I hope you may find time to read carefully my “addendum,” and my “Preface,” to Specimen Maori-English Lexicon—you will there see somewhat of the <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> literary trials I have had to put up with!—I have <hi rend="italic">endured</hi>!</p>
