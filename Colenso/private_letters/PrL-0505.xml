         <p rend="end">Napier, June 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>., 1882</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I wrote to you twice in May, but I have had no reply.</p>
         <p>I now send herewith, in a regd. packet, those teeth and bones (last “find”!) I had mentioned to you, and which you had wished to see. I hope you may find them of some interest, and that <hi rend="italic">you will soon let me know something about them</hi>.</p>
         <p>I kept them (as I had said in one of my last letters) to show at our Ordinary Meeting last week, having <hi rend="italic">promised </hi>to do so. I should have sent them to you by steamer on Saturday last (17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.), but as I had fully expected to hear from you by the Mail this way,—also, to receive a Copy of vol. XIV, I delayed sending &amp; writing:—<hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> however to hand, I delay no longer.—</p>
         <p>I enclose a cutting from one of our locals,— “Dy. Telegraph”, of 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., the Editor, now a Member of our Institute, was present, at our Meeting, &amp; apparently took great interest therein; he has given a very fair résumé: the Meeting was a good one,—though <hi rend="italic">heavy on</hi> me. I have specimens of those 3 Ferns, &amp;c., for your Museum, which, I think, will please you: they have greatly both Sturm &amp; Hamilton.—</p>
         <p>Do, please, let me know <hi rend="italic">something</hi> about those <hi rend="italic">2 teeth formerly sent</hi>; I am weary with enquiries.—Never mind replying <hi rend="italic">just now</hi>, to my questions <hi rend="italic">re </hi>a work on N.Z. Ferns.</p>
         <p>Shall be glad to <hi rend="italic">see </hi>a copy of vol. xiv. and do not forget the proposed arrangement <hi rend="italic">re</hi> those vols. of “Trans.” being carried at <hi rend="italic">Mag. </hi>post-charges. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> it will be that or <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>.   <lb/>I am, my dr. Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
