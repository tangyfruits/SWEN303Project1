      <p>To, Dandeson Coates, Esqr.,<lb/>Secretary of the Church Missionary Society.</p>
      <p rend="end">Com. of Cor. Feb. 18/34.</p>
      <p>Sir</p>
      <p>Understanding that your Society is in want of a person, to go out to New Zealand as a Missionary-Printer,—I offer to it, my services unreservedly.</p>
      <p>First:—as a Printer, I feel myself competent for “Press and Case,” in the common routine of the Trade:—</p>
      <p>Second:—as a Bookbinder, knowing that Art, also, which might be of service, combined with the Printing Department, there:—</p>
      <p>Third:—aware of the value of the Religion of Christ, whatever also, is, or may be, in my power, I wholly dedicate myself to carry forever the cause of the Cross, against the mighty—</p>
      <p>In offering myself, Sir, to your Society, I beg to state, that ’tis not, I trust, (with regard to myself,) from <hi rend="italic">any worldly motive</hi>, as the offers I have, or, (in the event of your accepting my services) may refuse, would be far more lucrative.</p>
      <p>With Regards to my Character, I would refer you, Sir, (in London,) to Mr. Watts, your Printer. (in whose employ I have been near <hi rend="italic">four</hi> months) and to the Rev: J: Dyer:—and in my native Town, (Penzance, Cornwall,) to the Church Minister—the Wesleyan and Dissenting Minister—and to the principal inhabitants.</p>
      <p>To the consideration of your Society, Sir, (under God,) I commit myself:—Trusting that, if it is His will, it may be pleased to accept my services—if not—refused them:—</p>
      <p>                       Awaiting your answer<lb/>                               I remain<lb/>                           Yr: mo: ob: servt.<lb/>                         William Colenso Jr.</p>
