         <p rend="end">Napier, New Zealand,<lb/>January 8<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1898.</p>
         <p>Dear Madam</p>
         <p>Shortly before Xmas. I received your letter of 31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. Octr., in which you wished to obtain from me “specimens of the five species of <hi rend="italic">Fossombronia </hi>named by me”. At <hi rend="italic">first</hi> I feared I could not possibly do as you desired, for <hi rend="italic">two </hi>reasons: (1.) from my peculiar <hi rend="italic">present</hi> position,—not being able to use my right hand &amp; arm freely, arising from a very serious fall when out driving in April last. which broke my elbow bones, &amp;c, &amp;c, so that I cannot well use my hand and arm, save for writing: and (2.) from my not knowing in which parcel, or lot, or box, to look for those Hepaticæ you required; and there are dozens—I may truly say scores—of such lots roughly made up and set aside. However, as I much wished to aid you, I have been working parts of 3–4 days, and now send you what I can find of <hi rend="italic">Fossombronia </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Noteroclada</hi>:—that is, <hi rend="italic">according to their numbers</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> from examination—which I cannot carry out at present. I have also had a rare &amp; long search after <hi rend="italic">Petalophyllum</hi> (2 sps.) without success, unless a spn. I send (no. a 1547.) should prove to be the one. Stephani, however, gives this no. as <hi rend="italic">“F.? sterilis</hi>”: and I find, on my referring to my descry. of <hi rend="italic">P. australis</hi>, (Trans. N.Z. Instit., vol. XVII, p.261,) that I had “only seen 3 spns. of the plant.”——</p>
         <p>Of several <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ</hi> I have but very small (and poor) specimens left, having given them away to American Cryptogamists—Drs. Evans, and Underwood, and others; while of other specimens I have plenty; but I never cared to collect any quantity of each, merely for Kew &amp; myself, and always <hi rend="italic">con amore</hi>, rarely ever mounting any.—As you are acquainted with the Kew Museum, should you desire any <hi rend="italic">other</hi> specimens, the better plan would be for you to note down <hi rend="underline italic">the number</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">given by me</hi> with the specimen at Kew) then, probably, I might be able to find them;—that is, if health continues, as my advanced age (nearing 90) and weak state are obstacles to my doing much more work, especially being <hi rend="italic">unassisted</hi>.——</p>
         <p>And as I happened to have a spare copy left of my paper containing descry. of <hi rend="italic">Fossombronia</hi>, sps., &amp;c, I post it to you with this note &amp; small packet, as probably you may not have seen it. I trust the <hi rend="italic">few little </hi>specimens I send may prove of some small service.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
