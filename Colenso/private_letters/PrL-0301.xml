         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand,<lb/>Novr. 15, 1875.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>My last to you was on the 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> October—at a time when I was very unwell. Last week I recd. yours of 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. Sept. Also, some papers including a Graphic for all which I thank you.–</p>
         <p>I shall not be able to write you a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter this time, for I am just returned from Taradale, in trap, &amp; I find, to my horror! that Grubb (who has for a week been telling us of the S.F. Mail leaving on 18<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">now</hi> informs us in the “Telegraph” of this evening, that he must make up his S.F. Mail <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>, 16<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—and I have several letters to write!! Perhaps had I not in my last to you (&amp; to a few others) written of my <hi rend="italic">then</hi> state of health I should not now write, under this pressure. No doubt at that period I was <hi rend="italic">very</hi> ill. Dr. H. has recently told me that <hi rend="italic">he </hi>was struck w. appearance &amp; symptoms. That he had never seen me so bad before. I am not yet <hi rend="italic">out of the wood</hi>. I am still taking med., <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi>,—I went out, on Friday last (12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.) to see Ormond who had been back nearly a month &amp; I had not seen him; &amp; today I was obliged to go to Taradale (Martin’s) to see M., whose 3-year term is up, &amp; who would not turn out—although I had let the place to another, @ £20. pr. ann., which sum M. had refused to give, &amp; had taken N. Williams’ 16 ac., adjg., &amp; built a ho. on it, &amp; my place going to ruin,—weeds <hi rend="italic">only</hi> &amp; fences <hi rend="italic">all down</hi>! M. had <hi rend="italic">since</hi> found out that he cod. get by subletting £25. a year, &amp; so wished to keep it on. However, that is all settled.— My voice is returning <hi rend="italic">slowly</hi>, but no power of tasting or smelling: cough less, but w. pain in chest, <hi rend="italic">increased </hi>when I stoop forward to write—as it <hi rend="italic">is now</hi>. I think I told you, in my last, of the Sns. in Carlyle St, which were the Natives’—well, Blythe got them from them, as I could not go to Lyndon’s auction; I sent him an offer—£2. pr. ft. frontage for all—<hi rend="italic">not </hi>for 1 or 2—(that was the <hi rend="italic">Reserve</hi>). L. however sold 2 (nearest Mundell’s), at 44/-, or so,—<hi rend="underline italic">perhaps</hi> all <hi rend="italic">after</hi>, but I don’t know. Knowles (as <hi rend="italic">usual</hi>) has done well <hi rend="italic">for</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> in his ¼ ac. (R.) corner next Odfws. Hall: he has actually cut it up into 7 lots, with a lane 9 ft. wide, &amp; they are all let &amp; 4 built on, smallest @ £7. pr. an. largest £10. or more; but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has spoiled Cl. Sq. w. his hookery. Lindsay has cut up Weber’s opp. corner of ½ ac. into 5, has let one, or more, &amp; is anxious only for <hi rend="italic">good </hi>tenants. Peppercorn’s place fencing-in &amp; improving Cl. Sq. is now before the Muny. £750., and I suppose they will go in for that <hi rend="italic">also</hi>! The Mayor has given notice of a Rate No. 213, for Water! &amp; Goring is now sinking a Well, near his Foundry for them. G. <hi rend="italic">got water</hi> for Robjohns &amp; R’s. Brewery is being erected fast. Lindsay <hi rend="italic">sold </hi>the Sn. nearly opp. to Wh. S. Brewy. at £2.10 pr ft. frontage!! (it belonged, I think, to an Aucklander).—Watt <hi rend="italic">gives up</hi> his paddocks next month. 4 are <hi rend="italic">out</hi> for Napier—Mayor, Capt. W. Russell, Sir D., and—today—Tuke, &amp; this evening’s paper speaks of a Requisn. to Sutton!! Capt. W.R. called to day, for my vote,—which I have promd.—If I don’t come out myself: I cannot help thinking I have a kind of (<hi rend="italic">quasi</hi>) right to this <hi rend="italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">nd</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. </hi>Nap. seat. Major Carlyon is also dead, making 4 from that family within a short year! he died at Sydney, &amp; his body has been brought back. Bower (ack.) accosted me, some time ago, as <hi rend="italic">your</hi> agent, for Rates due from you. I asked, on what Sn.? but he could not tell me then: I promised to call—then I became unwell, but I called 3 days ago, (as I should soon write to you)—and I found it was on your House!! I told B. that was sold to J.H., &amp;c. What confused B. was—Renouf’s putting down J.H. for the <hi rend="italic">adjoining </hi>Sn. By the way, how could you jump to the conclusion that Reardon, Bl. &amp; S-k-r., was going to <hi rend="italic">leave</hi>? A mistake that of yours.</p>
         <p>R. Price has been <hi rend="italic">repeatedly </hi>walking-in to me of late, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Mao. Lexn., &amp; <hi rend="italic">such matters</hi> (the old story). From <hi rend="italic">his </hi>paper I find, that the Ho. voted me £200. for the Elementary Maori Books, (2 vols.) written by me in ’63–’65, on Hon. Mr. Fox’s order (endorsing Dr. Shortland’s <hi rend="italic">Off</hi>. letter) but the money <hi rend="italic">promised</hi> had not been paid, and I, vexed, had omitted to ask (order) for it. R.P. runs his head agt. it—as being some<hi rend="italic"> thing new</hi>.—&amp; I have not cared to undeceive him!—The anny. in your old ch. came off very well: Mr Sidey was last week at Waipukurau, &amp; they are soon to have a Presbytn. Minister there ( a Ch. of Engd. one arrived there last <hi rend="italic">mo.</hi>) H.R.R. gives land, &amp; something towards maintenance. The Ch. Reserve at Hampden (No. 14, containing 2 acres) is to be sold, upset £4. pr. ac. I see a Mr Purvis has Sns. on 3 sides—I hear that Rathb. wants it.—</p>
         <p>Well now I can’t write <hi rend="italic">you</hi> any more. I wish you <hi rend="italic">had </hi>told me <hi rend="italic">much </hi>of your voyage, &amp; that you <hi rend="italic">will </hi>of your passing an Eng. winter: all about it.—</p>
         <p>Goodbye! with best, aye <hi rend="underline italic">best</hi> wishes,<lb/>—Believe me, ever yours, W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I saw plenty of ripe strawberries at Burton’s today (15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) (you will remember the plot), but the old man was not polite enough to offer any.—</p>
         <p>I have not seen Rev. Mr. Sidey since my last to you; nor, indeed, for a long while before that: he is however well. Neither have I seen Grubb, or Dolbel, or any one—save Fannin, who called one day in passing. W. Marshall has also been very unwell, similar complaint to mine (<hi rend="italic">Bronchitis</hi>), &amp; so have several others I hear—inland,</p>
         <p>                                             Farewell                        W.C.</p>
         <p>Possibly go next week to Waipukurau for <hi rend="italic">change of air</hi>.</p>
         <p>I also recd. yours from Exeter of Aug. 31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. via Brindisi.</p>
         <p>Rev. G. Morice has arrd. w. his wife, &amp; is now at Xt.Church, so his brother William told me here last week, he came here to <hi rend="italic">buy the mare</hi>!—I am to give my decision about her shortly.             WC.</p>
         <p rend="end">16<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.                        </p>
         <p>This mg. I sent my man to P.O. And Mr Grubb writes to me a note saying—please tell Mr Luff that I have been greatly interrupted last few days—one of my children took ill,—the Inspector of P.Offices arrived &amp; is still here, &amp; the Mail is to be got together (<hi rend="italic">both</hi>, indeed, S.F. &amp; Brind.) &amp; sent off today—2 days earlier than was advertised—<hi rend="italic">so I cannot write to him by this Mail</hi>: his letter has been received: will write by next. Remember me kindly.”—</p>
