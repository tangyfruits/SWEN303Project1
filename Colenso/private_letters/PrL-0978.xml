         <p rend="end">Napier, Sunday night,<lb/>December 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. 1896.</p>
         <p>Mr. A. Olsen,<lb/>Norsewood.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I was much pleased in receiving your letter of the 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. for I had long been wondering at your silence, as you had not before been given to do so. I feared all manner of things, chiefly that you were very ill: though Dr. Macallan had told me in his letter, that all my Norsewood friends were well. Now, however, you have fully explained it. I have <hi rend="italic">first </hi>to thank Mrs. Olsen for her usual kind remembrance of me—my best and kindest regards to her. But how to manage better, and so make a longer stay among you, I do not clearly see—at present. However, I must <hi rend="italic">not now </hi>talk of visiting Norsewood: I <hi rend="italic">may</hi>, perhaps by and by in the autumn, and if I do then I will let you know.</p>
         <p>I thank you for those nice specimens of flowers from your garden—the pretty neat little <hi rend="italic">Veronica Olseni </hi>in full flower, looking charming—I will thank you to save me some <hi rend="italic">ripe seed </hi>of this, which, from the appearance of these here, will soon be ripe—gather them while seed pods are closed. Also, the other, <hi rend="italic">Ranunculus</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">R. Ruahinensis </hi>I think,) if you can preserve me a few flowers—just with their own short <hi rend="italic">slender</hi> flower-stems—I will thank you—<hi rend="italic">dry them </hi>if you please. There is <hi rend="italic">another Ranunculus </hi>that you have (<hi rend="italic">R. sychnopetala</hi>), you sent me specimens before, at two different times: If this one is also flowering with you I will thank you to <hi rend="italic">dry </hi>me a few flowers also. If you go to the Ruahine at Xmas. I wish you <hi rend="italic">success</hi>! only lamenting I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> go with you!!—I have not seen Mr. Hill: I think he has been too much engaged during this election time: and now he will have school duty to attend to.—I was to have been at Dannevirke <hi rend="italic">today</hi>, but I remained here till the election was <hi rend="italic">over</hi>—I intend <hi rend="italic">leaving on Wednesday next</hi>, and pass through Makotuku on <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>, 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. by express. I do not intend to stay long inland on this occasion, having nothing to do—in the way of duty, save to name some trees at Woodville planted out in the square there by the Borough, and this, of course, will depend on weather.</p>
         <p>I shall not <hi rend="italic">see </hi>Othenius here, this time—I sincerely hope he may succeed <hi rend="italic">fully</hi>. I am pretty well, <hi rend="underline italic">now</hi>, but my <hi rend="italic">old cold &amp; cough</hi> from August has not yet quite left me!—I am just back from Cathedral evening service. With kind regards Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly                      W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. If you happen to see Hans Mortensen—tell him of my <hi rend="italic">movements</hi>.</p>
         <p>Election ended <hi rend="italic">capitally</hi>—<hi rend="italic">all right, satisfying every </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">thoughtful</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> man</hi>.</p>
