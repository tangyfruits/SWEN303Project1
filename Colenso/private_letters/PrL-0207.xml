         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>March 6 1866</p>
         <p>Dr. Eccles,<lb/>Hon. Secy.,<lb/>Dunedin Exhibition.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Before I left Wellington in November last, I understand from our good friend Dr. Hector, that you were pretty far advanced in printing your Exhibition essays. Dr. Hector being now away to the N., precludes my asking him, how such are getting on? I therefore trouble you, my dear Sir, with this note. The fact is, I have had repeated friendly enquiries from several quarters respecting these essays,—or (more strictly speaking,) the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> which I contributed: may I ask, whether they are printed?</p>
         <p>If the <hi rend="italic">Botanical</hi> one is completed I would thank you to forward a copy each to Dr. Hooker at Kew, and also to Dr. Seeman, London (addresses below). I find, by last Mail from England, that there is to be an “International Horticultural Exhibition &amp; Botanical Congress” on a large scale to be held in London in May next,—to which I have been specially invited to contribute a Paper, but there is no time;—a copy however of our Botanical Essay might not be wholly unacceptable, and if sent by <hi rend="italic">this Mail</hi> will arrive just in time. In my letter to the Honorary Secretary of the Congress, I have mentioned my writing to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to forward him a Copy of the Dunedin Exhibition essay on the Botany of N.Z. (N. Island).—</p>
         <p>Pray my dear Sir, freely excuse my troubling you, and </p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Very faithfully yours</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I hope Dr. Hector fully informed you as to the extra no. of copies of each essay I had requested to be supplied with. W.C.</p>
         <p>Dr. J.D. Hooker,</p>
         <p>Director Royal Bot. Gardens,</p>
         <p>Kew, London.</p>
         <p>Dr. Berthold Seeman,</p>
         <p>Hon. Secy. to Bot. Congress,</p>
         <p>57, Windsor Road,</p>
         <p>London N.</p>
