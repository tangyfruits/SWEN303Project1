<p>Novr. 23rd., 1889.</p>
<p>Dear Capt. Russell</p>
<p>I am sending by Mail this day, addressed to you, my first instalment of Copy for Press of the little book for the government printer. I trust you will cause it to be put early into his hands.—</p>
<p>I fear you may not have time to spare to run through it: though I should much like for you to look at the said résumé (authenticated as it is by Mr. Busby): and particularly at no.1 of the Appendix—as it is high time the matter I have there laboriously worked up should be set to rest. I may tell you, that I wrote to Vogel, when Agent General in London, to get Cook's log, &amp;c, looked up:—but he took no notice of my letter.—</p>
<p>I trust you will also get the little (key) map published with the book: and, perhaps, the 3 plates of Views in the Bay.</p>
<p>I have added, in appendix I, several interesting &amp; unique reminiscences of the olden time.</p>
<p>But I won't worry you with a long note.—</p>
<p>With very kind regards, and hoping that you are keeping ion good health</p>
<p>I am,</p>
<p>Dear Capt. Russell,</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>W. Colenso.
