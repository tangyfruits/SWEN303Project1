         <p rend="end">Monday mg. <lb/>Decembr 2nd. 1867</p>
         <p>His Honor D. McLean Esq </p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>As you very kindly said you would shew Mr. Stafford the propriety of re-granting me the privilege of franking and receiving <hi rend="italic">on Service</hi>, I have thought it best to send you a copy of my Official about it to Mr. Richmond.—</p>
         <p>I have lately had a letter from the N. asking for <hi rend="italic">stamps</hi>, in order to forward me papers,—and I have also lately had a letter from Hokianga, which, being insufficiently stamped, I had to pay not only the amount wanting—but also the <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>, so that I really am in a <hi rend="italic">fix</hi>—for if I send stamps (6d. of course) they may or may not be properly used,—and if <hi rend="italic">too</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">much</hi>, then there is a loss—if <hi rend="italic">too little</hi>, then I am fined additional—&amp; all out of my pocket.</p>
         <p>Besides, I take 5 copies of the “<hi rend="italic">Waka Maori</hi>,” to send to those very men who are helping me,—which I have <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to put stamps on!—in addition to subscription.</p>
         <p>I should think a <hi rend="italic">word</hi> from you to Mr. Stafford would be sufficient (I have been thinking often of writing to him myself, and would have done so had I not written to Mr. Richmond)—as Mr. Stafford originally Gazetted it, very early in ’66, before that Mr. Richmond or Mr. Hall took office.—<note xml:id="ftn2-148" place="foot" n="148"> Colenso was granted the privilege of free franking on at least three occasions—initially in 1866, and twice in 1885, while he worked on the Māori Lexicon (Robertson GI 2009. <hi rend="italic">The Rev. W. Colenso to frank free</hi>…. Postal History Society of NZ Inc, Newmarket).</note>
         </p>
         <p>I return your Papers with many thanks for your kindness. Now that you are about to lose the Judge, and other Visitors, if you would fix some day for an hour’s talk on public matters I will thank you</p>
         <p>     And am, <lb/>           My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
