         <p>Dear Mrs de Lisle</p>
         <p>Many thanks for your kind note containing good news of this morning: I am so glad to hear of my good friend the Dr. being “much better”, &amp; can fully sympathize with him in his feeling “<hi rend="italic">weak</hi>”. I have not been to <hi rend="italic">town </hi>for 3 weeks (only <hi rend="italic">twice </hi>indeed since I returned from the Bush District), for being weak (knees specially) it is such a job for me to get into &amp; out of “trap,” and to walk about with unsteady gait (duck fashion!) when in town, that I have put off going thither for a season—but when I go, I shall <hi rend="italic">call on you </hi>and hope to find the Dr “all right” again. My arm &amp; hand are much better, and I must use the old term “daily improving” though slowly. Now that the weather is a <hi rend="italic">little </hi>more settled, I can go outside &amp; take walking exercise, which however, <hi rend="italic">soon </hi>tires me. Spring is coming, or rather, <hi rend="italic">come</hi>, witness the elegant light-green dress of the willows, and pink blossoms of the peaches around us. Glad to hear such good tidings of Rodolph—but, “woe’s me!” I cannot yet venture to give the dear fellow a dance: however, that too, is <hi rend="italic">to come</hi>: he <hi rend="italic">must be </hi>growing a fine fat boy: ½ dozen kisses for Rodolph. And kind regards for the Dr. &amp; yourself.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours faithy.,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
