         <p>Dear Mrs Hill</p>
         <p>Having concluded preparations for tomorrow (when I have <hi rend="italic">2 Services</hi> in Cathedral!) and knowing how very busy I must be in the early days of next week, (S.F. Mail closing on Wedy. mg., and I leaving for Bush District on Thursday 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>.,)—I have made up my mind to write to <hi rend="italic">you now</hi>, &amp; answer your note of yesterday: although I <hi rend="italic">feel too tired</hi> to do so as I wish—for these last few days have been rather trying ones with me—striving to get through several heavy jobs, so as to be able to leave next week.</p>
         <p>In reply—I shall enclose a ₤1. note—&amp; say nothing about it.</p>
         <p>I am looking forward to meet Mr. Hill inland: my own stay there (this time) will be short: I hope to return to Napier on 7<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. March, as I have promised Rev. O. Dean to take Service in his Ch. for him on the 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, and I am <hi rend="italic">under promise</hi> to Mr. Robertshawe to do the same for him on the 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. of this month,—&amp; again on 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. of the next, that he may be free to visit the out-lying far off scattered settlers.—</p>
         <p>I note what you say about Dr Hocken and Mr Hamilton—I doubt much my seeing them here—unless they should arrive early.</p>
         <p>With very kind regards, I am</p>
         <p>Dear Mrs. Hill, Yours faithy.              W. Colenso.</p>
