         <p>Dear Mrs. Hill,</p>
         <p>I feel—I <hi rend="italic">have felt</hi>—that I ought thankfully to acknowledge your exceedingly kind remembrance of me here alone in my “Hermitage” on Christmas Day; and I endeavoured to send a faltering message to that effect by your dear daughter Miss Hill: my cruel fate has suddenly and most unexpectedly laid me aside this festive season—but I must not, dare not repine.</p>
         <p>I managed to crawl out yesterday (Wednesday), for I had written to the Bishop, to let him know, I would (if able) call on him,—and when I got there I found he was <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> to Tarawera!—I came back in extreme pain from a renewed attack of my foe, which placed me <hi rend="italic">hors de combat</hi> for the rest of the day!—–</p>
         <p>I enquired after Mr. Hill and some said, he was gone to Ruapehu:—others (today) that he is not yet gone “awa.”</p>
         <p>I had engaged with the Dean to take the Sunday Services in the Cathedral on 31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. (if able)—but that cannot be, and so I must write to him.</p>
         <p>I trust that you &amp; yours, <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, have thoroughly enjoyed this Xmas.-tide, being happily together in <hi rend="italic">one </hi>nest, and I hope <hi rend="italic">all well</hi>.—–</p>
         <p>Wishing you and Mr. Hill and all your dear family a <hi rend="italic">“Happy New Year”</hi>—and with respects and kindest regards—           I am,</p>
         <p>                             Dear Madam,</p>
         <p>                             Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>                                     W. Colenso.</p>
