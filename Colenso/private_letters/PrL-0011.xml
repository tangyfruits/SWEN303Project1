         <p rend="end">Paihia, Bay of Islands,<lb/>New Zealand,<lb/>June 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1838.</p>
         <p>Sirs and Brethren,</p>
         <p>My last Letter to you was dated in March last, and sent pr. “Seringapatam”, together with 4 copies of the New Zealand Testament, which, I trust, you safely received.—</p>
         <p>Since the date of my last, I have been engaged in Binding: have bound near 300 copies; and am now about commencing the Prayer Book. I get on but slowly from want of assistance; however my conscience exculpates me from the charge of Idleness.—</p>
         <p>I send by the “Buffalo”, (which came in here, on her passage to England, 2 nights ago,) 6 more Testaments; 1 for Mr Knight, which, please, let him have pr first opportunity, and 1, from Mr. Davis, <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>for Revd. I.N. Coleman: making 8 in the parcel now sent.—</p>
         <p>With regard to the principal subject in my last communication, Brethren, allow me to say that the desire of my heart to go forth amongst the people is unchanged, save that I long more earnestly to be set at liberty—that I may be enabled more fully to declare among these poor benighted Tribes, in the strength of my Master, the Word of Reconciliation.</p>
         <p>A Native was shot at Hokianga about a fortnight ago; for the murder of a white man. He was tried—Mr Busby presided—sentenced to death, and shot accordingly. My <hi rend="italic">Brother</hi> Turner says, in a Letter to me, “I have a good hope concerning him.”—</p>
         <p>At Kaitaia, the Revd. Hy. Williams baptized 49, and at the Waimate the Revd. W. Williams baptized 48, about 3 weeks ago.</p>
         <p>Sickness prevails to a very <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>great extent at present among the natives, hundreds are now ill around about us.—</p>
         <p>I look forward with great delight to a trip among the Natives in January next. I propose (D.V.) to go, on foot, from hence by the Eastern Coast, to the East Cape and the Mahia—thence to Waikato, and from there up the Western Coast to Hokianga. By strict application to my work <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, I shall get my Brethren here to grant me an holiday in the Summer; and no schoolboy ever rejoiced more to get one, than I shall to get out, once more, among these, our children of the wild.—</p>
         <p>My health has been pretty good—save that my eyes have been a little affected by opthalmia. I trust that the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> will, however, restore to them their wonted strength.</p>
         <p>By a Schooner from the Colony, which came in this morning, we hear of the death of our beloved Father in the Gospel, the Revd. S. Marsden: he fell asleep in Jesus on the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. May <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>last. No particulars have yet reached us.—</p>
         <p>May the Lord be with you—Fathers &amp; Brethren, to guide you <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, and that continually prays</p>
         <p>your devoted Servt.,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
      </body>
