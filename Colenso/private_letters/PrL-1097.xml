It being my earnest desire to do justice to every Province—particularly in shewing the large amounts of valuable timbers, barks, gums, drugs, fruits, vegetable &amp; fibre, &amp;c, annually used within the Province, (as well as the quantities exported therefrom, and, also, to give some approximate quantity of what may be still available, or annually so</p>
