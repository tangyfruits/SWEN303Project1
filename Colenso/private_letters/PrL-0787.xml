         <p rend="end">Napier, July 7/91:<lb/>(VI. p.m.)</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Yours of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. came to hand last night, &amp; I thank you for it: and as I did not (in my last) ansr. fully your former letter—I will now do so as I best may—though, to tell you the truth, I do not feel well fit for anything this evg. (would that I could sleep for a few hours, like you do!) This mg. I left at XI. for Mr Brandon’s Meeanee—by Rymer but instead of his usual fine ’bus, Harvey had a very small coach, &amp; we were 10 besides himself, and I am still feeling the effects of my unpleasant journey, there &amp; back, &amp;c, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>Your <hi rend="italic">last</hi> letter first:—I thank you much for all your kind &amp; zealous endeavours in my behalf, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> that Qy. Rev., &amp; hope I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> get the coveted loan of the same from Liby. G.A. You <hi rend="italic">surprise</hi> me in saying—“by the no. (CX) I take it to be about 1854, though <hi rend="italic">I cannot discover any ref. in Collier to that partr. No</hi>.”<hi rend="italic">—</hi>Surely I could not have made <hi rend="italic">that mistake</hi>—CX. for XC.—in my note to Capt. K. or to Libn. G. Assy.? or, if I did Gore’s letter would serve to correct it: besides, you, in your search in Collier, would surely have detected it? <hi rend="italic">If I have done so</hi>, &amp; Capt. R. does not detect it in time, then I am in a woeful mess!!—Collier, at p.134, has <hi rend="underline italic">XC</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">twice</hi>.</p>
         <p>I am much interested in what you say of your 4 vol. 8vo. copy of <hi rend="italic">Cook’s</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Voyage, when you have a spare ½ hour, just see if it says something of <hi rend="italic">our N.Z. botany</hi>: Anderson a Scotchman was his ship’s Dr. on that Voyage, and I know he wrote a little about it, &amp; the Maoris also, but not scientifically, and I have always wished to see it.—</p>
         <p>If I recollect aright—it was J.Wh’s. “<hi rend="italic">widow</hi>” (not “his friends”) who sent in the Petition: I hope, <hi rend="italic">not a cent will be granted</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I don’t care 2 straws! To see “the great Cornishman Mark G.P.” &amp; hope he may not find me <hi rend="italic">out</hi>. I do not believe in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of those globe-trotters: m. or f., for Ch. or state, I would be inclined to except the Quakers (“Friends”) who always travel to preach <hi rend="italic">at their own expense</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">no</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> collections.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>There is a talk of forming a Free Liby. at ’Pukurau, to memory of H.R.R., and of putting up a meml. stone in <hi rend="italic">Cemetery</hi> there to memory of Miss H.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> spns. for Kirk: I have done <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> since I returned from Bush—10 days ago! have had really <hi rend="italic">no heart</hi> to go at them again (having had also more important matters to attend to), but <hi rend="italic">must</hi>—nolens volens—recommence tomorrow. <hi rend="italic">I must use</hi> this sitting-room <hi rend="italic">table</hi>, &amp;c, &amp; <hi rend="italic">must </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">clear away</hi>, at XII.30 for dinner, and again at IV., these are some of the disagreeables &amp; drawbacks.</p>
         <p>I have recd. the copy of “Typo” for June: have just looked at it, and <hi rend="underline italic">wonder</hi> (oh! <hi rend="underline italic">greatly</hi>!!) <hi rend="italic">how it is possible you can do so much</hi>. Indeed, you <hi rend="italic">make me feel ashamed</hi>. I enclose a clipping from “E.N.” <hi rend="italic">re</hi> same. (Not so: as I find from yours, that you <hi rend="italic">Do get the 2 Evg.Papers</hi>: it is in <hi rend="italic">that of 6</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>). In town <hi rend="italic">yesty</hi>. on business I called on Hon. Secy. White, to know <hi rend="italic">how</hi> he stood for next Monday night, he said, the Bp. had promised a short paper. I went, also, into our Library proper, &amp; found it jammed full! w. long tables, 2 doz (more or less) of chairs, big blackboard &amp; stand, &amp;c &amp;c—so that I could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get to the Book-cases!! (Mrs. W. had told me, below, of it: &amp; that this arose from the night sch. there)</p>
         <p>Of course you will have heard of the Donelly v Broughton case: and I trust—agree (w. me) in <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">decision</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Now to the still unansd. portion of your <hi rend="italic">former</hi> letter.</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>I feel ashamed of “poor old Travers”! would he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> shut up, &amp; retire.</item>
            <item>You have very very kindly given me a long &amp; intg. account of your meeting of Wgn. Phil. Sy. I am sorry (as I said in my last) to find Tregear failing—in health: &amp; can only hope he <hi rend="italic">may</hi>, ere it be too late, take more care—<hi rend="italic">more rest</hi>.</item>
            <item>Taylor Wh’s. <hi rend="italic">Infliction</hi>—we must [I suppose] have <hi rend="italic">again</hi> at our next meeting—another very dreary hour! &amp; time utterly wasted. I shall have a great mind <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go: if it should rain, or be very windy—<hi rend="italic">I don’t go</hi>.—I had lent the Bp. the back vol. (X) of “Trans”. contg. my <hi rend="italic">full</hi> paper on the Dog of the Maoris, &amp; he has just returned the vol. &amp; is <hi rend="italic">quite satisfied</hi>: would that T. Wh. had but read it <hi rend="italic">before</hi> he took up pen, as <hi rend="italic">I had strongly advised him to do</hi>.—</item>
            <item>With you I must say, I am all but <hi rend="italic">indifferent</hi> to what the Parliament are doing: I don’t believe in them!—</item>
         </list>
         <p>I am obliged (just now) to confess my ignorance of the <hi rend="italic">botanical name</hi> of the “Wattle” you enq. after—the one w. “the golden bottle-brush flower, &amp; fetid seeds &amp; rootlets.” A few years ago I endeavoured to find it, for late J.A. Smith, but failed: I have here “Fl. Australiensis” from our Liby. wh. contains 293 ascertained species! But I cannot <hi rend="italic">readily</hi> spot it. <hi rend="italic">?Is it Australian</hi>
            <hi rend="bold">. </hi>It is growing <hi rend="italic">here</hi> w. me, and when it again flowers I will have <hi rend="italic">another</hi> try. There is a vol. pubd. at Melbourne under auspices of Baron vol <hi rend="italic">(sic)</hi> Müller, giving list of useful plants, &amp;c. to be grown by Settlers, &amp;c—I dare say it is among them—for its bark (?) and no doubt a copy is <hi rend="italic">there</hi> w. you: perhaps <hi rend="italic">here</hi> too, but alas! the blockade of our Liby.!!</p>
         <p>“Petosporum”—should be <hi rend="italic">Pittosporum</hi>—as you supposed:—several sps. here in N.Z. &amp; some make <hi rend="italic">good</hi> hedge plants—bearing clipping well.</p>
         <p>I should mention (though you may already know it), that <hi rend="italic">Acacia dealbata</hi>, is the one that has been used &amp; exported so largely for its bark—in tanning.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Don’t believe</hi> the Donkey story at Whangarei—<hi rend="italic">neither</hi> the chq. for “1500 dollars” for the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> butterfly!!</p>
         <p rend="center">——–</p>
         <p>I am keeping pretty well:—went to Taradale last Sy. mg. &amp; took the Ch. S. there—Mr Tuke at P.Tapu: evg. went to Cathl. (first time for 6 months) to hear the <hi rend="italic">Bp. preach</hi>.</p>
         <p>I shall endeavour to get through spns. for K. this <hi rend="italic">week</hi> (<hi rend="italic">first</hi> lot at all events), unless White Hon. Secy. should <hi rend="italic">again</hi> spur up the “old hoss”!—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Very glad</hi> to hear such good news of your dear little ones! I can &amp; do fancy, how gladdening it is to you &amp; to Mrs H. to witness such improvement.</p>
         <p>With kindest regards, <lb/>Yours ever, <lb/>W. Colenso.<hi rend="bold"> </hi>
         </p>
         <p>Mr Brandon has a large lemon tree studded w. fine lemons, a splendid sight!</p>
         <p>Craig recd. a letter from Dawson, Akaroa, for copy of my “<hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> on Maoris” (in vol.1. “Trans. N.Z. I.” and with it 8.0—</p>
         <p>I must not omit to say <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is much of <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> in the long yarn <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Maoris—in clipping “Akaroa Mail”.</p>
         <p>P.S. In D.T. of this Evg. is the following: “Govt. agents for the Bureau of Industries have reported to Mr <hi rend="underline italic">Tregear</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">.</hi>” &amp;c.—is this <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Tregear?</p>
