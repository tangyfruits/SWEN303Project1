         <p rend="end">May 19/43.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>1. Some considerable time has elapsed since I last wrote you:— My last Letter being dated, July 26/42. I should, however, have certainly written to you long ere this, had not the many and peculiar changes continually taking place whispered—<hi rend="italic">wait</hi>. With my last I sent a small box, containing sundry Books and Mss., the whole of which, I trust, you have safely received. </p>
         <p>2. The work of the Pg. Office is now executed by Mr. Telford, who, safely and unexpectedly landed here in the end of the past year, and into whose charge I committed the whole of the Printing and Binding <hi rend="italic">Materiel</hi> on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. of January last. Mr. T. arrived just as I was about <hi rend="italic">finishing</hi> the composition of the last copy of Translation, and has subsequently been employed on a Dictionary (referred to in my last) of the Native language.—A work which I was sorry to see begun, as it will, I fear, eventually prove a heavy outlay of Money, with little prospect of utility, and less of reimbursement. I wrote a letter to our District Committee (a copy of which I enclose,) on the subject of printing of the Dictionary, which did not, however, cause any reconsideration of their Resolution. Mr. Maunsell has, already, lost £55. in publishing his Grammar, although only three nos. have yet appeared.</p>
         <p>3. On Mr. Telford’s arrival, the N.D. Comee. wished to remove me to the Southd., which, following out what I perceived to be the path of duty laid down by the Parent Comee. for me, (as expressed in par. 3. of your Letter of May 17/42.) I would not consent to do without their approval, and wrote our District Comee. a letter to that effect,—a copy of which I enclose. I regret to have to notice, that Mr. Telford, perceiving the state of things, did not act altogether as I think you quite intended he should do; wishing, doubtless, to have the entire Superintending of the Printing Department; and, possibly, thinking by so acting, to obtain it the sooner. Although <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>I assiduously endeavoured to keep from anything approaching collision—by doing little acts of kindness, yielding of many matters which by right belonged to me, and even offering to abstain altogether from the entering the Printing Office, for “quietness sake”. Mr. T. <hi rend="italic">writes</hi>, and considers, himself “Superintendent of the Press”; so that, should it be deemed advisable on the part fo the Parent Comee. to continue me in that situation, it will be quite necessary, I think, for them clearly to define our respective duties. In mentioning these matters, I would do so in the kindest possible manner, with regard to Mr. T., consistent with duty, because, considering all things, I can but think it quite <hi rend="italic">natural </hi>for Mr. T. to act as he has done. For, at the period of his arrival, I had just finished plastering the house in which I had always resided, and fencing in the ground and stocking the gardens belonging to the same, (having lived for nearly 8 years in an unfinished dwelling,) and completed by degress year after year the various little wants of the Printing Office, so that every thing around looked quite inviting. <hi rend="italic">All </hi>which Mr. T. was led to expect he should possess on my being removed to the Southward.—And, because I would believe, (if it be the wish of the Society to keep up a Printing Establishment in New Zealand,) that Mr. T. may, through the Divine Blessing, be useful to the Society and the Mission in the situation which the Parent Comee. have assigned him in the Printing-Office.—</p>
         <p>4. Just about the period of Mr. Telford’s arrival, I had it in consideration to write you my ideas respecting the Press.—I thought that it would be most advantageous to the Society (taking into consideration all circumstances,) to cease keeping up a Printing Establishment in New Zealand; and, I still venture to think that such would be best. There are several Presses now in the Land, at the different large Settlements, where any small printing required might be executed by contract, with the advantage of each district being supplied in its own dialect. <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>Future editions of the Testament and Prayer Book, will, I dare suppose, be always executed in England; where they can be done better, cheaper, and more expediciously. And, I think, that the fact, of their not being any thing whatever of a direct Missionary character printed at the Society’s press during the last six months, (save a proof “pulled” of the first half-sheet 12mo. of Joshua,) although the Establishment has been attended with a very great increase in expenditure, will tend very much to confirm the truth of my supposition. I venture to think, my dear Sirs, that it will be soon the case with the Press, as with the Columbine, the Farm, and the Public Store; the end being, in a measure, answered for which it was set up, it will be found desireable under existing circumstances to discontinue it. Perhaps twelve months longer trial will more fully develop the truth of my observation. At all events, I would strongly urge on the Comee., (in case they decide on my moving to the Southward,) the necessity of having a Superintendent for their Press, (if possible from among the Clergy,) whose duties should be <hi rend="underline italic">clearly defined</hi> in a Letter of Instruction from the Parent Comee.</p>
         <p>5. My own situation, during the last six months, has been a very unpleasant one; (not a little reminding me of what Mr. Wade’s was 4 or 5 years ago,) the Bishop, too, being evidently prepossessed against me! Better days, however, are, I hope, at hand. I have often found the path of duty a narrow and apparently difficult one, but have invariably proved it to be infallibly <hi rend="italic">safe</hi>. I have had to pass through many sore trials of late, but, blessed be the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>! I do believe they have been, and will be, for my spiritual good. He has enabled me to <hi rend="italic">live down</hi> my enemies, and now the Bishop (from whom I have lately had two kind Letters,) is, without any effort of mine, become my friend. At his Lordship’s suggestion and arrangement I go, in a few days, to the Waimate, there to reside for four or six months, to study preparatory to Orders. I know not where my future lot may be, nor am I at all anxious about the matter, save that, <hi rend="bold">[4]</hi> (if it please the Parent Comee. to disconnect me from the Press,) I should wish to labour in a populous District, as far as possible from the encroaching white man; and, if possible, among some of those Tribes who have heard and received the Gospel at my hands. His Lordship has already licensed me to Catechetical Duties, for which, I hope, I am thankful. I venture, however, to suppose, that <hi rend="underline italic">few</hi>, if <hi rend="italic">any</hi>, among us will ever be admitted to Priest’s Orders,—unless the Standard of Qualification (an Examination in Latin, Greek and Hebrew) be greatly lowered. I trust, however, <hi rend="italic">with </hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps italic">God’s</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> Grace, cheerfully to serve Him</hi> among the poor Natives in whatever vocation I may be placed,—whether as Catechist, Reader, or Deacon. “For I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, than dwell in the tents of wicked ones”.—</p>
         <p>6. Among other things, I have to inform you, my dear Sirs, of my marriage; which took place on the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of last month, at Otahuhu near Auckland: Mr. Fairburn’s eldest daughter (of whom honourable mention has been made by the Bishop of Australia and others, as a useful and active member in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Vineyard,) is now my wife. It had long been a matter of earnest prayer with me for guidance in this important matter, and I can but believe that the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> hath graciously pleased to direct me to a partner every way suitable for a <hi rend="underline italic">Missionary’s</hi> wife. It was my intention to have gone single to Waimate, but, at the wish of the Bishop (who, in his Letter to me of March 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., says “If you would prefer coming as a married man, I have no doubt that we can make arrangements for Mrs. C’s. reception: and she will be of great assistance in the revision of the New Testament. In fact, I should very much prefer this arrangement, as my short visit at Maraetai would prepare me to be glad of any opportunity of extending my acquaintance with her;”) I have concluded to go thither married. <hi rend="bold">[5]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>7. I have read the charge brought forward by the Chairman of “the Aborigines Protection Society,” relative to the Sale of Books and more than supposed pocketing of the price by the Missionaries, but am not greatly surprised at it; as such has been the common taunt of our Roman Catholic adversaries for many-a-day. We have often—invariably, when we <hi rend="italic">could </hi>do so—sold Books to the Natives, of which I supposed you had been always well aware, from the entering (at least) of those I had sold in the “Return, No.1,” sent by me to each half-yearly Comee., and from the often mentioning of such transactions in Journals, &amp;c, as well as from the more recent remittances of monies received on account of such sale of Books. Until lately, the payments generally received by me have been in work rendered on account of the Society—digging, fencing, &amp;c., &amp;c.,—or in exchange for different fruits of the earth,—melons, pumpkins, maize, sweet potatoes, peaches, &amp;c., &amp;c.,—which were used by ourselves and numerous native visitors on the premises. We ever found that Books (and, in fact, every thing else,) were taken much greater care of by the Natives, when earned or paid for with ever so small a price, than when issued gratuitously. I enclose a List of Books, sold by me at different times to Natives and others, (see enclosure D,) the amount of sale of which was always carried by me to my Cash account in the P. Office Ledger. In August, 1840, I received an official order from the Secy. of the N.D. Comee., (in consequence of the <hi rend="italic">number</hi> of Books I was selling from the general Stock,—the policy of which Order, however, is still unknown to me,) to the effect “that no Copies of the New Testament, or other Books, be issued in future, but under the sanction of the Comee., which effectively precluded my selling any more Books from the General Stock. I have, however, subsequently sold a considerable number of those which fell to my share, (in making a division of Books among the Stations,) several of which have been sold for marketable produce—potatoes, pumpkins, &amp;c, &amp;c,—and which I have constantly debited myself with at the common <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>market price of such articles; often, I believe, so at too <hi rend="italic">high</hi> a rate. Two days ago, an old Native Chief came to see me, and told me he wished a Comm. Prayer, and that he would pay for it (if I was willing) in pumpkins; enquiring, how many would be required. I told him, he should have one for a dozen; to which he instantly and gladly assented. Yesterday, he brought the pumpkins, and received his Book; I charging myself 3/- for the vegetables; which are, to me, of little use. Instances of this kind, only having <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> payments given in return, (such as, a bunch of onions, a fish, a bundle of firewood, a few cabbages, a wild pigeon, and, sometimes, an English Bible or Com. Prayer obtained from the shipping, and, more recently, some one of the Roman Catholic publications in the New-Zealand language, or a crucifix, or medal,) are of common occurrence. We have, however, (at least <hi rend="italic">I </hi>have) always freely <hi rend="italic">given</hi> Books in travelling, although the doing so has, sometimes, unfortunately caused dissension and jealousy among the Natives of the place, as only a privileged <hi rend="italic">few</hi> could possibly attain such prizes. Within the last two years, I have, on 5 different occasions, sold one pound’s worth of Testaments to a single native at once; <hi rend="italic">three</hi> of whom <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> their money from Port Nicholson. I have, also, had applications from white men, traders on the coast with the Natives, for Books; and, on one occasion, spared one respectable trader 6 Testaments, for which he paid me 6 bushels of Maize, which I set down in my book as £<hi rend="italic">1..4..0</hi>, the very <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> price in the market. I, also, enclose, a List of Books, &amp;c., sold (as mentioned before from <hi rend="italic">my share</hi>,) by me, during the 2 years ending June <hi rend="italic">next</hi>; and which will <hi rend="italic">all </hi>have been paid by me in a/c with our Secretary (with, perhaps, some future addition,) at the next Comee. meeting, at the close of the six months ending in June ensuing. I may here mention, that, in addition to monies (or vegetables, &amp;c.,) received for <hi rend="italic">new Books </hi>sold, I have, also, received a few trifling sums, or equivalents, from Natives for my repairing <hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>of their <hi rend="italic">old </hi>Books; which amount, I scarce need say, I have, also, carried to a/c.</p>
         <p>8. I have very recently received the Books and Watch; so kindly sent me. <hi rend="italic">Bagster’s version of the Vulgate</hi>, however, is of <hi rend="italic">no manner of use </hi>as a book of reference when disputing with the Romish priests. I much wish for one of their <hi rend="italic">own </hi>editions of this work, together with a few other Books of which a List is enclosed.—And which, I trust, you will cause to be sent me as soon as possible <hi rend="underline italic">by first vessel</hi> to the Bay of Islands, Auckland, or Sydney. <hi rend="italic">Do not send any thing for me to Port Nicholson, or to any other port in New Zealand, for the present, </hi>than those <hi rend="italic">two</hi> already mentioned. “<hi rend="italic">Scott’s Continuation</hi>,” 3 vols., among the books sent, is made up, I find, of three <hi rend="italic">different </hi>editions! The 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. vol. of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. vol. of the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>., and the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. vol. of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. edition!!</p>
         <p>9. I enclose a Copy of the List of Printing and Binding Materials and Stores, and Books, &amp;c, &amp;c., delivered by me into the charge of Mr. Telford on the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. of January last; the original of which is in the possession of Rev. R. Burrows, who is now our Secretary.</p>
         <p>10. I hope that the Indent of Medicines, Stores, and Books, forwarded in my last, has been attended to and shipped for New Zealand, ere this.</p>
         <p>11. Should Mr. Tegg, Bookseller, (or any other person) send you a parcel of Books for me, I would thank you to pay him the amount of his Bill, which will be but small.—</p>
         <p>12. I have lately had occasion to write to Mr. Johnstone, Hunter Sq., Edinburgh, and to enclose the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. and 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. of a Sett of Bills of Ex., for £<hi rend="italic">30</hi>, drawn upon you by our Chairman and Secretary in Commee. at Waimate on Jany./43, and numbered 1; should such Bills be presented by <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, or his <hi rend="italic">order</hi>, please duly honour the same.</p>
         <p>13. The Romanists (who have lately had an accession to the number of their priests,) are active. They have published a Book of 55 pps., 8vo., containing sundry Prayers, a Litany to the Virgin Mary,<hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>directions how to cross, and how to use the Rosary, and a long rambling address to the Natives; in which address the Romanists state, that <hi rend="italic">we </hi>and “all protestants, (who owe their origin to Henry VIII, Luther and Calvin,) will, without any reserve whatever, when we die infallibly go to hell, unless we conform to our Holy Mother the Church of Rome”! Last week, they had a grand day at Kororareka, consecrating and laying the foundation of their new Church. Were they opposed as they ought to have been, (or were they now manfully met,) I feel quite sure they would soon give up New Zealand as a soil in which Popish slips will never thrive.—I hope, however, (though <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> in this warfare) soon to have another little book out against them. I have good reason to know that they hate me with unceasing hatred. I much wish some Christian friend at home, would send me the <hi rend="underline italic">useful</hi> and <hi rend="italic">authentic</hi> works of the Protestant Association.</p>
         <p>And now, my dear Sirs, I must hasten to bring my long Letter to a conclusion. I sincerely hope, however I may have erred in any of my views herein expressed, that I have been led to lay them before you from no other source than that of a good intention. May the Giver of every good and perfect gift, continually enable us for all things! and, having stablished and strengthened us for all He may be pleased to require, finally bring us all to His heavenly kingdom of peace and rest, through the alone merits of Jesus Christ our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>my dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>Ever most sincerely yours,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p rend="end">Paihia, Monday morning<lb/>May 22. 1843.</p>
         <p>About to send my Letter to the Post office; I add, by way of Post Script, that His Lordship the Bishop returned from the Thames on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> instant, landing at Wangarei, he travelled hither—having rain every day—by way of Ngunguru, Owae, Papapaaumu, Wangaruru &amp; Waikare, so that the whole of that Coast has, also, been seen by His Lordship.</p>
         <p>Since I closed my Letter, I have read our Anniversary Sermon (which has just come to hand) preached by the Rev. Hugh Stowell, and am delighted beyond expression. Blessed be <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>! for strengthening and enabling His Servant thus fearlessly to speak! I hope its arrival <hi rend="italic">here</hi> will be productive of much good among some in New Zealand who have to minister in Holy things. And, as (I hope, in some degree at least) a tried servant of a few years’ standing and experience in the Missionary Field, I implore you, my dear Sirs, and you, Fathers in Christ, of the Parent Committee—in the Name of our Lord and for the sake of the souls of the poor dear New Zealanders—who, though professing Christianity and able to read the Word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God, </hi>are, therefore perhaps, the more easily imposed upon by any religious observance of “voluntary humility and will-worship,” having a specious outside—never to send any one to this field of labour, however exalted his attainments, however flaring his zeal, who is in any way tainted with those “anti-christian” principles. Let such come—and <hi rend="italic">we are divided</hi>; let such come—and the Natives—our own Natives—<hi rend="italic">are </hi>Romanists. May you ever give the fullest attention to what God’s Servant <hi rend="italic">then </hi>spoke, especially to the words contained in pp. 18–21, and may the Holy Spirit ever more enable you for your arduous task. Amen, and Amen——                   W. Colenso.</p>
