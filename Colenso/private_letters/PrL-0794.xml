         <p rend="end">Napier, July 25<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, 1891</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Mantell</p>
         <p>My attention has been lately drawn to a passage in Collier’s “Bibliography of N.Z.”, reflecting pretty strongly on your honoured Father &amp; on me: I have obtained a copy from Didsbury, and I would call your attention to the above, at p. 134.</p>
         <p>I have also just got (after long search) the loan of the vol. Qy. Review, referred to by Collier from your G.A. Liby., (as none could be found here in H.B., nor with Gore &amp; others there in Wellington,) and I intend writing a short paper <hi rend="italic">re </hi>same for our Institute, as a kind of necessary appendix to my old &amp; long paper on the Moa:—showing, that, as far as I am concerned, <hi rend="italic">no </hi>early paper of Prof. Owen had ever been seen or heard of by me, neither, I believe, by any of the Missionaries in N.Z. And this, I think, is pretty well shown by <hi rend="italic">a letter of Col. Wakefield, to J.R. Gowen, Esq.,—dated “Wellington 19 Septr. 1843”</hi>: in which he says:— “I received <hi rend="italic">lately </hi>your letter respecting the Moa <hi rend="italic">with Profr. Owen’s notice—</hi>——I have<hi rend="italic"> </hi>taken steps to procure some of the bones,” &amp;c. (Now my paper referred to by your Father (and also by Sir W.J. Hooker &amp; others) was written more than a year before this one by Col. Wakefield.—You will find the Colonel’s letter (with others) at p.109, “<hi rend="underline italic">Owen’s extinct wingless birds of N.Z.</hi>”—and that letter read together with Owen’s own statement, (<hi rend="italic">preface</hi>, p.v,) seems to me <hi rend="italic">quant suff. </hi>Owen there says,— “In this distribution in N.Z.” (of Copies of his <hi rend="italic">first </hi>paper) “I was <hi rend="underline italic">efficiently aided</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> by Col. Wakefield, by J.R. Gowen, Esq.,” </hi>&amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Of course, you know that there was <hi rend="italic">very little</hi>, if any, communication between Wellington and Bay of Islands at that early period: for my part, I think, that all Owen’s friends &amp; others of the N.Z. Land Co. here in N.Z. <hi rend="italic">at that very early time</hi> had <hi rend="italic">too much</hi> of necessary and important matters to attend to, to think much of the Moa bones:—but what I want to learn, particularly, (hence my troubling you) is, <lb/>1. Was that Mr. Gowan ever there at Wellington?<lb/>2. Did you ever hear of any of those<hi rend="italic">first </hi>papers of Owen, having been distributed in N.Z.—Cook’s Straits &amp; further S.?—</p>
         <p>Any other items throwing light on this subject that you can supply will be thankfully received.</p>
         <p>You should <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the full &amp; very long <hi rend="italic">note</hi> (occupying nearly a whole page of small type!) given by the Qy. Reviewer, <hi rend="italic">loc. Cit</hi>.—but, unfortunately <hi rend="italic">for you</hi>, I have the said vol. here at present, but you may also have a copy of that vol. (XC.) in your own Library.—I shall hasten to return this.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are keeping well, &amp; with very kind regards,—</p>
         <p>I am, Dear Mr. Mantell,</p>
         <p>Yours faithy,        W. Colenso.</p>
