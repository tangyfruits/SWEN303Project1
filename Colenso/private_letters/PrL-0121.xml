         <p rend="end">Waitangi,<lb/>October 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1852.</p>
         <p>Mr. William Morris<lb/>Waikokopua.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>For some time past I have been thinking of writing you a few lines; and, I believe, that I told one of your Natives (whom I happened to see at Tangoio) as much in the winter.—Mr. Grace, when he was here, also mentioned your name; and, after him, my brother-in-law, Mr. John Fairburn; and now, this day, your old assistant Angus McQuarrie having called, and said, that he was going your way next week, I eagerly lay hold of this opportunity to send you a few lines.—</p>
         <p>I had heard of your doing well where you now are, having had some luck in the sperm whale way, and I was very glad to hear of it. Not that I think you will ever become <hi rend="italic">rich</hi>, that is, as the term is generally used; yet a contented mind is riches; and to <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, I do not think you are a stranger. I had also heard of your being about to come this way again, to return to your old quarters at Rangaika; and, while I felt glad in one respect, I felt sorry in another; for I feared, that you would not do much here in the whaling way.—</p>
         <p>I had also heard of your having opened a Public house; but as this may be false I will not say anything more about it, only, that I would rather you should follow <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> else than grog-selling. I am sure <hi rend="italic">you</hi> won’t be angry with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for my blunt way of speaking.—</p>
         <p>Well, and what shall I tell you? why what you have already heard—that a great portion of this country has changed owners since you left, although its appearance is nearly the same. And, before long, I suppose much more of the Land will be sold; for I believe the Natives here will act, much as children with a box of gingerbread,—a bit today, and a word <hi rend="italic">heoi ano</hi>:<note xml:id="ftn1-183" place="foot" n="183">heoi ano = there is no more.</note> and then a bit more tomorrow with the usual <hi rend="italic">heoi ano</hi>: and so on until all is gone; and then — — what then?—</p>
         <p>Why, <hi rend="italic">when all is gone</hi>, (if there should be any Natives left,) the Natives will know the <hi rend="italic">value</hi> of <hi rend="underline italic">time</hi>, and of <hi rend="italic">money</hi>,—and be much more steadily industrious and less independent than they are now.—</p>
         <p>Your old friends—Moananui, and the other chiefs are all living, and much the same as ever: They have now plenty of <hi rend="italic">taonga</hi>, but I question whether they or their people are greatly the better for a large portion of it. With all their property,—their horses—and their <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> (for this Land),—they still beg tobacco, and (through their own improvidence) often want a meal!</p>
         <p>I had, in the winter, thought, that everything was settled, and that I had nothing to do but to put up a house as quickly as possible on the spot of Land which I had got in near to Te Rotoatara. I had engaged Mr. Edwards to saw timber, and so on; but now, all is stopped again.—It is not unlikely, but that I may leave this neighbourhood for good, ere long.—</p>
         <p>My garden is now in pretty good order; if I can supply you with any thing—seeds, roots, shrubs, flowers, or trees—in the proper season, I shall be glad to do so.</p>
         <p>Both myself and Mrs Colenso feel greatly obliged to you for your kind and prompt attention to her brother on his way hither. I dare say you may have seen our two dear children in their way to Auckland. <hi rend="italic">We feel their loss very much; our house seems quite lonely without them.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Mr Kier is, I believe, doing well; he is living on the Rangitikei River, and not very far from its mouth, upon his <hi rend="italic">own </hi>land. I believe that he bought 200 acres there.</p>
         <p>I suppose, that we shall have Mr. Williams back again soon; I think, that we shall <hi rend="italic">all </hi>be glad to see him. It is now nearly 8 years since I landed here! how fast the time has rushed by! what a large piece this is out of a man’s life! How much nearer we both are <hi rend="italic">to our last day</hi>—and to <hi rend="italic">the </hi>great day of account. I often think, what a sad, what a poor account <hi rend="underline italic">I </hi>have to give;—what a blessing it is, to know, that we have a merciful Judge, who is both Saviour and Friend. May you and I be enabled to <hi rend="italic">value Him more</hi>;—&amp;, seeing that we have an <hi rend="italic">open </hi>door before us, even Jesus Christ, may we both be enabled to <hi rend="italic">enter there</hi>.</p>
         <p>I hope to look out a little book or two for your Son, (supposing that he may be able to read English,)—which however may do for you both.—</p>
         <p>We are beginning to want a little oil; what I am now burning I brought from the Bay of Islands! If you have any good, and the Cooper can bring me a little I should be glad to get some. I can pay you either in cash, or order payable at Turanga or Wellington or Auckland.</p>
         <p>Once more then I bid you Farewell!—May God ever protect &amp; bless you. Believe me,</p>
         <p>                       very sincerely yours,</p>
         <p>                                               W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Should you ever get a little <hi rend="italic">ambergrease</hi>, I would thank you to remember me with a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> bit.—W.C.</p>
