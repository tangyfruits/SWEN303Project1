         <p rend="end">Napier. Jany. 13/81</p>
         <p>A. Luff Esq.,<lb/>  Wellington</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>This morning I received your note of the 11<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. and, having a spare ½ hour this evening, I lose no time in replying,—so as to answer your question <hi rend="italic">re</hi> seeds sent.</p>
         <p>First however I should thank you for seeds of the C. Islands plant—which folks will persist in calling a <hi rend="italic">Lily</hi>!—with which tribe it has no affinity whatever; it is very near to our English Forget-me-not and to the Borage; and it has a rather long name <hi rend="italic">Myosotidium nobile</hi>:—I fear however they won’t grow with me: I have had several plants, direct, (at one time a whole dozen in a box, which cost me nearly a £1.) One however, lived some time &amp; flowered beautifully (at this time I was in Genl. Assembly) but that too died.—May you succeed better!—</p>
         <p>The “Silver Acacia”—or “Silver Wattle” of some,—is the <hi rend="italic">Acacia dealbata </hi>(not diaplata of your gardener):—probably Wellington is too cold &amp; stormy for it: you know it flowers at midwinter. I have heard that it would not succeed inland at ’Pukurau.</p>
         <p>Thanks, too, for the papers: but don’t send me the “<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>” as I take in the “<hi rend="italic">Mail</hi>”, and get its articles, &amp;c., therein.—</p>
         <p>I am <hi rend="italic">now </hi>a subsr. to the “Waipawa Mail”: its principles are <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, which is <hi rend="italic">not </hi>the case w. our two Town ones. I have <hi rend="italic">not looked</hi> at a <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> for this year! and I may not again: it is brought daily, but only the servants get it.—The “D.T.” is just as bad.—</p>
         <p>Gavin Peacock, who was preparing for a voyage home in your ship the “Sobraon”, was last week taken worse, &amp; carried off to hospital, whence, I fear, he may never come out alive. T. Reynolds is ill, &amp; just made a Bankrupt! at which I am <hi rend="italic">sorry</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Mr. Grubb is pretty well, but busy, I rarely see him.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Glad </hi>to hear much good news of your son, may he continue to do well, always.</p>
         <p>Rain at last has done us good. Am pretty well: &amp; with kind regards, am, Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Carter of Wairoa is dead &amp; since that his son here in the hospital!</p>
         <p>I wrote to you at Xmas, hope you received it. You don’t however mention it.                                          W.C.</p>
