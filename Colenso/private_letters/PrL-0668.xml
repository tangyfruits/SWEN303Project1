         <p rend="end">Friday night<lb/>29th</p>
         <p>Mr. R.C. Harding</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your packet of this evening surprised me! It is most strange that you should have fallen-in with it in that kind of way!!—and I thank you for it, &amp; for your very kind note that came with it. I suppose you noticed the torn &amp; defaced title page?—</p>
         <p>I was again in town today (from an <hi rend="italic">early </hi>hour until nearly 1 o’clock) &amp; returned <hi rend="italic">fagged</hi>: I did think on you, &amp; of calling, but could not. On my return I found your <hi rend="italic">clean </hi>and <hi rend="italic">excellent </hi>proofs! (last night I was <hi rend="italic">wading</hi> through the 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. proof of my L. in “D.T.” this evg., &amp; the <hi rend="italic">great contrast</hi> was striking, and I endeavoured to read yours w. copy this afternoon though <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> with pain—teeth &amp; both jaws, <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> rheumatism—every now &amp; then laying down pen &amp; jumping up! I had, however, made up the packet of “proof” for you—before your brother kindly called.—Should your trained &amp; practical eye notice any word—stop—&amp;c—that could be <hi rend="italic">amended</hi>—notice same in margin.</p>
         <p>Let me have proofs, &amp;c—as early &amp; <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi> as you well can—I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> to get away inland, in a few days, seeking rest—ease <hi rend="italic">from pain</hi>.</p>
         <p>I did not like what was in “E. News”, last evg., neither what was in “Herald” this mg., <hi rend="italic">re</hi> our meeting of yesterday.—</p>
         <p>Whatever you do, do not allow the “Report” to <hi rend="italic">hinder</hi> my Paper or pamphlet.</p>
