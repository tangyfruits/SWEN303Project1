         <p>Mr John Drummond </p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have received your very welcome note (or, rather, letter) of June 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and thank you for<hi rend="sup">.</hi> it. <hi rend="italic">I am, and shall be, always glad to hear from you,</hi> &amp; only wish you would write to me oftener—if you have time to spare. My only, or chief reason for writing to you today is,—your sentence in your letter, viz “I expect to be able to send the balance of I.O.U. in a week or two”—this you must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> do (allow me to say) for you may very likely, as a beginner, want a little money; the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> (under cir­cumstances) I could think of taking from you during this year of 1880 would be another £6 (as last)—but not this, or any sum, should you require it;—indeed, permit me to say<hi rend="bold">, </hi>that were I not such a <hi rend="italic">heavy loser</hi> in that affair (&amp; no fault of yours)—over £200, and part of this owing to “Lawyers” and <hi rend="italic">their friends</hi>,­ I would not take a penny from you.—But enough of this.­—</p>
         <p>You also say—that “You did not like troubling me with so many letters”, hence you did not write; believe me, I like your letters; why? because I look on them as truthful ones; written from the heart and mind.­—</p>
         <p>No doubt you will find <hi rend="italic">more</hi> ferns in your Bush, &amp; outside too, than I have sent you scrap-specimens of; in N.Z. we have known, (say) 130, but more of this anon.—</p>
         <p>I <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> agree with you re the “sport” of <hi rend="italic">tame</hi> pigeon shooting; but why not adopt the<hi rend="sup"> </hi>glass ball?—I am sorry to hear from you that it was <hi rend="italic">not our</hi> Robertson who gained No 1 prize at Taradale. I should have liked for him to have got it; but, there, no doubt it is far better <hi rend="italic">as it is.­</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Our Eng Mail is expected <hi rend="italic">here</hi> on Monday. I hope to get a lot of papers (as usual) and if so will remember you. I have lots of willing receivers of them in the Country,—Gow, Ingram, Lambert, &amp; T. Stewart at Porangahau, &amp;c,.&amp;c.</p>
         <p>Weather delightfully fine, yesterday &amp; <hi rend="italic">today</hi>!</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>W.Colenso.</p>
