         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Novr. 19, 1880.</p>
         <p>My dear Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>I was right glad in hearing of your return to us again! Are you going to remain? or, is it merely bide-a-wee, with you, and then off again? Be that as it may, I hope you are <hi rend="italic">quite well</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Our Society held two Meetings last week: and I have been busy of late mainly on your account. You will see what a lot of writing I send you with this—4 papers of my own &amp; 1 of Dr. Spencers, and more to follow—of <hi rend="italic">wee ones</hi>.</p>
         <p>I think that both you and Mantell will find some curious and new things in my “Historical Incidents” paper. I have more of the same kind,—some indeed which I gave an oral running translation of from the Mao. Ms. to our Society,—and which, <hi rend="italic">if wanted</hi>, I could translate in writing: those are all curious stories.—Also, in my “Contributions”, part III., I hope you will [find] much new and interesting: this paper was read here at our last Meeting last week, &amp; seemed to give great satisfaction: indeed, I was (according to promise,) to read it again at Waipukurau tomorrow (Saturday) evening, but that has been put off.—Possibly in my “Vegetable Food” Paper you may find something new: I am sure that many will.</p>
         <p>The 3 remaining <hi rend="italic">short</hi> Botanl. &amp; Zoologl. papers will soon follow: you won’t want them yet,—and I found better specimens of 2 or 3 of my plants 3 weeks ago when in the Bush:—one a sweet little fellow of the <hi rend="italic">Hepaticæ </hi>family—and some fine Insects, some of which are both new &amp; highly curious; as I think you will say—<hi rend="italic">anon.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>my official note about pubs. of your Departt. Dr. Spencer, our Chairman, told us,—that he had been assured by you, that all such would be freely forwarded on application—which announcement was received with <hi rend="italic">hearty feeling</hi>! On my seeing in the Athenæum the <hi rend="italic">2</hi> copies of <hi rend="italic">each</hi> of your Geologl. Reports (’77, ’78, ’79,)—and we without any! I could not help thinking,—that 1 copy of each might have been sent there in mistake.</p>
         <p>Thanks for the big book on “Grasses” (parts v and vi) received yesterday: have not yet fould time to look into it—shall tomorrow.</p>
         <p>I wish I had <hi rend="italic">timely</hi> known of Capt. Broun’s getting out his work on our <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi>:—I think I could have sent him a few spns., &amp; so added thereto.</p>
         <p>I suppose it is of no use my expecting now any reply to a few questions I had made in my last letters to you? One only would I now venture to resuscitate,—Did you procure a specimen of <hi rend="italic">Lomaria Patersoni</hi> for me?—</p>
         <p>I would also ask, Is there any possible chance—way—method—or plan, by which I could get Mr. Buchanan to lith. a plate or two for me for the forthcoming vol.? something like your <hi rend="italic">Palinurus tumidus</hi>, or his <hi rend="italic">Marattia</hi> plates. Or could you get them done in wood? But I must put no more questions.—</p>
         <p>I am happy to say, that we have lately had several new Members. And, during your absence, I had to exhibit here a nice little lot of Fossil teeth (<hi rend="italic">Squalidæ</hi>) I thought I identified Carcharias, Oxyrhina, Lamna, Notidanus &amp; ? Corax,—also, several perfect spines of <hi rend="italic">Raiidae</hi>. various genera,—all obtained by an amateur from near Te Aute, in the lower Eocene,—but they had been all cleaned: there was also a fragment of a large bone (depth 20ft.) which seemed to differ from any <hi rend="italic">Moa </hi>bone I had seen. If you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> returning to Melbourne, I think I could get them for your inspection.</p>
         <p>I spent two very agreeable nights (3 weeks ago) at Waipukurau Hotel with Dr. Stewart of the Knox Church Dunedin; of course, you know hinm: he has just returned viâ W. Coast N. Island.—</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>my dear Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>with very kind regards,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
