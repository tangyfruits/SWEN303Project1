         <p rend="end">Saturday morning</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I regret I was not at home when your note of Tuesday last arrived.—I went, <hi rend="italic">early</hi> that morning to Waipukurau by the “Coach,” &amp; returned last evening: the weather, as you say, is truly delightful: I enjoyed the ride down yesterday very much. </p>
         <p>I now send you Ramsay’s Book—over which (although you have already read it) I expect you will have a few additional merry moments.—I can fancy <hi rend="italic">a certain party</hi> wishing him &amp; his Book at the bottom of the Red Sea;—and viewing him with a kind of “righteous horror.”</p>
         <p>Many thanks for the Papers: I sat up last night to read <hi rend="italic">Kempthorne’s letter</hi>—although I do not greatly like the man.—</p>
         <p>             Hoping you are well. Believe me</p>
         <p>                             My dear sir</p>
         <p>                                             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                                             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I brought a “kit” of dried Inanga (Maori dried, but done <hi rend="italic">cleanly</hi> &amp; for me)—<hi rend="italic">would you like a few handfuls</hi>? I always liked this fish, fresh or dried.—If you like them, <hi rend="italic">pray do let me know</hi>.—</p>
         <p>My hand is very shaky today—partly, I suppose, owing to the shaking &amp; jolting of yesterday.— W.C.</p>
