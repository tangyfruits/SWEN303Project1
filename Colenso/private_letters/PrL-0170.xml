         <p rend="end">Napier,—                                  <lb/>Saturday, January 23<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>.,<lb/>1864.</p>
         <p>The Hon. The Colonial <lb/>Secretary, Auckland</p>
         <p>Sir</p>
         <p>I have the honor to address you respecting a matter affecting myself, brought on Thursday last, the 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi> inst., before the Provincial Council of Hawke’s Bay, and which yesterday ended in a Resolution empowering the Superintendent to make an enquiry, and, if satisfied, to proclaim my seat therein vacant.—</p>
         <p>I do not know, Sir, whether I should more properly write to the Attorney General on this matter; but, if so, I trust you will pardon my writing to you, and forward my letter to the Hon. the Attorney General. I see, however, by the late Gazettes, that you are also at present acting for the Post-Master General, which is with me an additional reason why I should now write to you.</p>
         <p>The Case is simple, and well-known, and is as follows:—When this Province was first formed, the inland Mails were a Provincial charge, and carried by Maories; consequently I, as Provincial Government Interpreter, had to do all the Interpreting work, &amp;c. After about twelve months, the said Inland Mails became a General Government Charge, and then, on Maories again becoming Contractors, the Chief Post-Master here (Mr. Catchpool) requested me to assist him. I did so, and (although I soon after resigned my Office of Provincial Interpreter,) have done so, with little intermission, down to the present. I believe that I assisted the Chief Post-Master for two years, without asking, or indeed expecting any remuneration. I, however, had stated to him, on several occasions, my inclination to cease assisting him,—mainly from the fact of the number of Inland Mails carried being greatly increased, and all performed by Maories, and the work of writing, interpreting, arranging, &amp;c., &amp;c., becoming increasingly heavy.—</p>
         <p>At about the time of the late Post-Master General’s (the Hon. C. Ward’s) visit in 1862, it was arranged, that I should receive a ₤<hi rend="underline italic">50</hi>. gratuity for former Services down to June in that year; and, that a Sum not exceeding ₤<hi rend="underline italic">30</hi>. should be at the disposal of the Chief Post-Master for what assistance I might render during the following year, if I would continue to assist. At the same time, the Chief Post-Master at Napier was instructed, not hereafter to Contract to pay so much for special assistance without leave. Early in 1863, on Mr. Catchpool resigning the Office of Chief Post-Master, and myself (shortly after) also resigning that of Provincial Treasurer, I again wished to cease assisting the Chief Post-Master here, but I was (on <hi rend="italic">strong official importunity</hi>) induced to continue to do so, to aid the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Chief Post-Master who had only recently taken Office. But, in September 1863, I informed him by letter that I could not assist him any longer (copy enclosed).<note xml:id="ftn2-83" place="foot" n="83"> WC: copy of Letter to C. Post-Master, Napier, Sept. 1/63.</note> At Auckland, however, the then acting Post-Master General, Mr. Reader Wood, begged me to do so again on my return to Napier; (Mr. Elliott Elliott having also previously written to Napier to that effect,)—on returning hither from Auckland, I consented to assist the Chief Post-Master as formerly; only stipulating, that I should be paid according to the amount of work done, for which I should send in my account of charges quarterly.</p>
         <p>This, Sir, (or rather, what I did for the Government up to September, 1863,) has now been brought against me in our Provincial Council by Mr. Ormond (Member for Porangahau), and by Mr. McLean (Superintendent), as disqualifying me (under the “Disqualification Act” of 1858,) both for the Provincial Council and the House of Representatives. And which, of course, I have disputed, and do deny; believing, (as I have always believed,) that I hold no “office” nor “place” within the meaning of that Act.—</p>
         <p>I enclose, Sir, six printed Copies (such as I happen to have left,<note xml:id="ftn2-84" place="foot" n="84"> WC: Six printed copies of official papers in Maori <hi rend="italic">[****] </hi>relative to Mail Service, from 1860 to 1863.</note>) of some of my work for the Public Service; that you may the better form some idea of the character and <hi rend="italic">amount</hi> of it; among which you will find, the “List of Tenders received for Mails for 1863,” nearly 170 in number! all which had to be translated arranged and answered; although of the very many <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Maori letters to translate and answer, as well as of the many personal arrangements with them, occurring at all hours, you, Sir, can really have but a faint idea.—I would also further refer you (if needed) to copies of correspondence of last year, (filed in the General Post-Office Auckland,) between the late Chief Post-Master of this place, and also the principal Chief of Poverty Bay, Raharuhi,—to shew something of the <hi rend="italic">importance</hi> of the aid which I have had the honor to render to H.M. Service in this part of the Colony—for all of which, as I take it, the Country Residents in this Province should much rather be ready to thank me than to find fault.—</p>
         <p>I have the honor to be,</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>Your mo. ob. servt.,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
