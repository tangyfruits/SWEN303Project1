         <p rend="end">Napier, Wednesday,<lb/>Augt. 10, 1881.</p>
         <p>My dear Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>No doubt you bare busy (you always are so!) still, I must write you a line,—if only to congratulate you (in these times) at the passing last night of the Vote <hi rend="italic">re</hi> “Geologl. Depart.”,—of which we had the pleasing telegram in this morning’s “Herald”. It appears, however, that there were 2 or 3 attempts <hi rend="italic">against</hi> it—but <hi rend="italic">now you are safe</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Last week I received a case from Dunedin containing the “exhibits”: which, of course, had been mainly returned from Australia. Among them is the <hi rend="italic">cast</hi> you took of the Bell; this, however, is <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>: shall I send it to you? It is sadly, though not seriously, chipped all round, entirely owing to <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> packing: and my 8vo. Maori N. Test., bound in calf (which I prize), has a big nail driven right into its back <hi rend="italic">in nailing down the case</hi> from Dunedin, (a ragged ugly rusty <hi rend="italic">tear</hi>!) What vexed me was, the fool of a packer actually put a <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> of scraped flax <hi rend="italic">between </hi>the said book and another parcel, and so shoved the book, without any wrap, up against the dirty rough old case, instead of putting the said flax between the case and the book! Besides, I have received <hi rend="italic">no</hi> advice <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the case from Dunedin,—and it was found in a chance kind of way in Kinross’ store by one of our carters. Some of the smaller articles <hi rend="italic">I had sent to Dunedin </hi>(as “Veg. Caterpillars”, &amp;c.,) were deficient. I have been thinking of writing to Grant (Secy.,) about it.</p>
         <p>Enclosed is a cutting from “Daily Telegraph” of last evening <hi rend="italic">re </hi>our Inst. meeting on Monday night, it is a fair condensed résumé. The meeting was a good one (as to attendance &amp; interest exhibited), and was not over till past 10.—The shells mentioned are those which I had long wished to show <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, but I only found them last week! secure enough, and in first-rate condition in their <hi rend="italic">original </hi>packages, never having been opened since they were first put up in <hi rend="italic">1841</hi>!! When I send you the short paper read concerning them, I shall also send you specimens for your Museum, and I think you will be much pleased with them.—I was, in finding them <hi rend="italic">not</hi> included in your last work on the N.Z. Mollusca, for which, however, I was quite prepared: at the same time I shall send you some spns. of this new earth-dwelling <hi rend="italic">spider</hi>, with a short description.—</p>
         <p>We have <hi rend="italic">two </hi>more <hi rend="italic">new</hi> members,—and may yet have more,—but I have told our Council &amp; old Members, that you cannot well supply us any additional copies of vol. xiii. I suppose Mr. Gore safely received the P.O.O. I sent him last week for those copies kindly supplied.</p>
         <p>What on earth can Mr. Brown mean, in asking for “£<hi rend="italic">200</hi>. to collect and preserve roots and seeds of indig. plants on Ruahine, Tararua”, &amp;c.? To me, here, it seems simply ridiculous!</p>
         <p>I am much pleased with the plates in Berggren’s book; but, alas! the bulk of it is in <hi rend="italic">Swedish</hi>! of which I know nothing.</p>
         <p>I hope you are quite well. I should like to know <hi rend="italic">when</hi> you are likely to be disengaged—a wee bit.—</p>
         <p>I have been unwell, laid up several days with <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> lumbago; a most unwelcome visitor. I got to our meeting with difficulty.—</p>
         <p>And with very kind regards,</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
