         <p rend="end">Ahuriri, H.Bay, N. Zealand, March 16 1847<lb/>and Dup. June 3/47)<lb/>via Auckland)</p>
         <p>Mess. R. Dixon, &amp; Co.,</p>
         <p>Gentlemen,</p>
         <p>I sit down to write—having 8 letters (!) and 2 Invoices of yours laying on my Table before me. I wrote a very short note to you in Decr., informg. you of the goods pr. Madras havg. safely arrived last week (the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.), the goods pr. “Gypsey” made their appearance in no very good condition,—and now I lose no time in writing, and shall freely remark <hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi> upon several items.—</p>
         <p>No.1. earthenware, vulgar &amp; common—<hi rend="italic">blue—not accordg.</hi> to order</p>
         <p>2. spades, of 2 kinds—the better kind will do;</p>
         <p>4. Liq. Plants, &amp;c,—I think I merely wrote for fresh &amp; good root, for medicinal purposes; and for seeds; However I have (out of the whole) 3 plants living in my garden.</p>
         <p>6. “Fancy” (!) wafers—complete Trash<lb/>      Handkerchiefs—the<hi rend="italic">red</hi> ones (tho’ small) are near the mark—the common ?Scotch (“Monteith—Glasgow”, marked up on them) are very inferior<lb/>       2 Tweed coats—almost the<hi rend="italic">best</hi> &amp; most suitable articles sent<lb/>      Scarlet Large shirts—rather short<lb/>  4 angola coats—unsuitable—too high priced for Natives</p>
         <p>7. Wedding rings—<hi rend="italic">much too </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">small for</hi> N.Zealrs.<lb/>Scarlet cravats—very much too dear; just as good (equally as suitable) an article is to be had<hi rend="underline italic">here</hi> at 10/. pr. doz. The com. retail price at Wellg. is 1/.</p>
         <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Drab</hi> umbrella <hi rend="italic">sent</hi>—<hi rend="italic">white</hi> one ordered; such as the Quakers use: I <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> they are made of W. Brown Holland.—<lb/>Moleskin Trows. sent, good &amp; suitable—but all came much spotted; yet goods w. them were perfectly dry.</p>
         <p>9–11. 3 Bs. spades, said to be “w. straps”—only 2 Bs. howr. of that kind. The 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. very infr. article, not only <hi rend="italic">without</hi> straps, but T-handled.</p>
         <p>14. axe heads! a sad mistake this—but partly perhaps my own fault, —what I wanted were <hi rend="underline italic">small</hi> bright axe heads weighing about 4oz. each, which may be had <hi rend="italic">here</hi> for abt. 10/. pr. doz. This is a dead loss the art. being next to useless, having also previously more than a doz. by me.</p>
         <p>The Mills, I hesitate to speak of, from not having it in my power to <hi rend="italic">prove </hi>them. They do not look so well-finished as those already among the Natives in the neighd., wh. have some little addl. apparatus, brass gudgeons, &amp;c. They got a little rusty in coming water having got into the Cask; thro’ wh. many of the Combs were spoiled; and the B. Cotton, &amp; Blankets damaged.—</p>
         <p>The articles I have not noticed you may consider as generally giving satisfaction.—</p>
         <p>I may just mention, as a general rule for yr. guidance, that I always wish to have a serviceable yet cheap article for Native use; and, in addn. to what is <hi rend="italic">good</hi> &amp; useful, <hi rend="italic">neat</hi> for my own. I utterly dislike, any thing that is very inferior in quality for them, or vulgar or “<hi rend="italic">flashy</hi>” in appearance for my own use.—</p>
         <p>I enclose the <hi rend="italic">origl. </hi>of a sett of Bills on the Rev H Venn for £50 (Fifty pounds)—the Dup. of which I will also forward in a few days. I regret now I had not got them drawn for a higher sum—you will perceive they are drawn in adv., wh. is only done to come agt. <hi rend="italic">that</hi> quarterly salary. I hope with them you will pay yrselves the Bal. of yr. a/c £25.18.5—and, will with the remg. sum of £24.1.7, execute the small enclosed order mkd. A.</p>
         <p>In my note of Decr. last, I ordered,—<lb/>— a copy of P. Times for 1846<lb/>— 2 doz men’s cott. Braces<lb/>— 2 eye glasses nos. 2, 2½ in Tortoiseshell—<lb/>which,<hi rend="italic">if not already sent</hi>, you will please to <hi rend="italic">add.</hi> to the order marked A.</p>
         <p>(I have requested the “<hi rend="italic">Pictorial Times</hi>”—but I am in ignorance whether to prefer that paper to the “Illustrated News”—should the above mentioned articles not have been sent, will you have the goodness to make the selection?—I order the Paper wholly on account of its cuts.)+++</p>
