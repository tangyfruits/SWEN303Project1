         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Hawkes Bay<lb/>N. Zealand,<lb/>Jany. 22, 1851.</p>
         <p>Prof. Owen<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c<lb/>Royal Coll. Surgeons,<lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have this day sent off some packages of Botanical specimens for Sir W.J. Hooker, and have enclosed therein a small bottle containing specimens of (alas!) <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the known terrestrial mammals of this country!—viz. 2 specimens of the N.Z. rat and 1 ditto of the <hi rend="italic">N. Zealand Bat</hi>;—which I do myself the honor and pleasure of sending to you, and hope they may be not altogether undesirable.—</p>
         <p>For upwards of 15 years have I (in all my wanderings), diligently sought for a true N. Zealand Rat, but have never until now been so fortunate as to procure one, although I had offered large rewards for any that should be brought me. A short time back, however, I was unexpectedly delighted with some, which were dug out of their burrows in the grassy plains of this neighbourhood. Two of them were alive, and them I kept several weeks, in a common wire rat cage; during which period I had ample opportunities of observing their habits, &amp;c.—They appeared to be very inoffensive creatures, remaining all day in the centre of their grass bed, only eating by night, when they preferred maize to any other food, and seldom uttering a sound, which, when they did, was only a small squeak.</p>
         <p>I think you will find this animal to possess all the characters of a true <hi rend="italic">Mus</hi>; and in fact, approximating (outwardly) very near to one of our common British species. I have, therefore named it <hi rend="italic">Mus Novæ Zelandiæ</hi>; which name I should wish it to retain, if, on further examination, it should be found (as I suspect) to belong to that genus.—</p>
         <p>The other (dead) specimens, turned bad in the solution, (yours, “No.II,”) and I was obliged to throw them away.—</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bat</hi>, I got, also, alive, and kept it so upwards of 6 weeks. It amused us much with its tortuous flights when taken out to be fed at evenings in our parlour; as well as with its peculiar mode of eating—which is well described by Daniell, in a note appended to (Bennett’s) “White’s History of Selbourne,” Lett. xi. p50; and which is equally true concerning this species. It preferred the liver of a fowl, and, above all, the large “blue bottle” fly (<hi rend="italic">Musca —</hi>); it would, also, drink a little milk; but on the whole, took a very small quantity of food.—It invariably shunned the light, both natural &amp; artificial; and hung suspended, all day and night, by its hind paws, generally clinging by one only.—</p>
         <p>I have not a description of <hi rend="italic">Forster’s </hi>Bat, (<hi rend="italic">Vespertilio tuberculatus</hi>, G. Forster;—Gray’s List of Mammalia, Dieffenbach’s N. Zealand, vol. ii, p.181,) but that species is there stated by Gray to be “Yellowish brown, &amp;c,” which does not accord with <hi rend="italic">this </hi>species. Nor can I reconcile it with a species of <hi rend="italic">Vespertilionidæ</hi>, which Gray summarily describes at p. 296 of that volume; and which he states to be a “<hi rend="italic">new </hi>genus, (<hi rend="italic">Myrtreina</hi>),” and, yet to be identical with Forster’s <hi rend="italic">V. tuberculosus</hi>: in this Gray evidently confounds the 2 species.</p>
         <p>I believe that there are several species of Bats in this country; and that <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, which (from its ear, &amp;c,) I think will prove to be a true Vespertilio<hi rend="italic">, </hi>will make, with Gray’s and Forster’s, a third distinct species.—</p>
         <p>Forster’s Bat (<hi rend="italic">V. tuberculatus</hi>), was discovered by him at Dusky Bay, where, I have lately learned, a species of Bat is now found, inhabiting the deserted subterranean holes of the “<hi rend="italic">Mutton-birds</hi>”;—possibly a species of Procellaria<hi rend="italic"> or some other nearly allied congener.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>This species now sent is, when alive, of a fine glossy black-brown color, fur rather long. From hollow trees, in the low lands, near the Mission Station.—</p>
         <p>I, also, send you 4 Bat-skins, from the hilly country in the interior. These I lately obtained from a Native who had preserved them for me; and, though in a bad state, yet (as they have the jaws &amp; ears &amp; forepaws attached, I send them also. I think these may also prove to be distinct, at least from the one in the solution.</p>
         <p>I have recently received a small lot of <hi rend="italic">Moa </hi>(<hi rend="italic">Dinornis</hi>?) bones of large size and in excellent preservation. But, being the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> I have been able to procure for a very long period, (in fact, <hi rend="italic">all </hi>that I have gained since I sent you my last,) and believing, (from report,) that you and others must by this time have been pretty well stocked, through the exertion of Mantell (<hi rend="italic">fil.</hi>) and other Collectors,—I do not now send them. Nor can I do more than passingly advert to them, through want of time just now—they are, however, among the largest I have yet seen.—</p>
         <p>I sent you, some time ago, portions of the jaws of a Seal? (<hi rend="italic">Phoca leptorix</hi>?) I hope you received them; although they were scarcely worth your notice. Should you particularly wish a perfect skull of that animal, I think I might, some day or other, be able to get you one.</p>
         <p>Believe me.  My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>very faithfully yours,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
