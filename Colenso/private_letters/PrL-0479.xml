         <p rend="end">Napier, Jany. 13/82</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I have striven to keep my promise (in my last), and have just finished putting-up for you 2 small packets—one of plants, &amp; one of shells (2 species), &amp; hope they may reach you safely.</p>
         <p>The plants are fair specimens of nearly all the newly-described ones (in my last paper): the <hi rend="italic">two not sent</hi>, shall be forwarded as soon as I can get <hi rend="italic">good </hi>specimens—which I hope to do on my <hi rend="italic">next</hi> visit to the Woods: the shells will speak for themselves.</p>
         <p>I have just heard from Mr. Gore, in reply to mine to him of last week: he tells me you are <hi rend="italic">very busy</hi>,—which I quite expect. I hope, however, you may be able to find time to <hi rend="italic">look</hi> at the specimens now sent,—and I also hope they may please you, and be cared for (somewhere and somehow!) in your gigantically &amp; fast-growing Museum.</p>
         <p>I have now to put-up &amp; send off specimens (Plants) to Petrie, and (Lepidopt.) to Fereday: Maskell (for <hi rend="italic">cocci</hi>) must wait a while. Then, to prepare our Annual Report, &amp;c., and then (perhaps?) a holiday.</p>
         <p>             Ever yours truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I wrote to you on Sunday, 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., returning slips of Appx II.—</p>
