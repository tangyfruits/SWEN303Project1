         <p>His Honor, D. McLean Esq.</p>
         <p>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. </p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Thinking over the present state of affairs (Hauhaus and settlers) it has occurred to me—to offer you my personal services to go and see these unhappy people—this morning, if you approve of it. To try to bring them to a better state of mind—or, at all events, to know their wants, and (if possible) their intentions—before proceeding to the last resource.</p>
         <p>I suppose you know well the old Native Custom (which these half-wild peoples no doubt still hold) or in such matters to treat with “Chiefs”—or those whom they consider to be such. I will call on you at your office at x a.m.</p>
         <p>     I am, <lb/>             My dr Sir,</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly,</p>
         <p>             W. Colenso</p>
      </body>
