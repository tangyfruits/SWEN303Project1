         <p>Messrs. Dixon &amp; Co.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen</p>
         <p>An oppory. at last offering for Wellington I am enabled to send you the Duplicate of my order of the 26 Novr. last, together with a second of each of 3 Setts of Bills therein mentioned amtg. to ₤150.19 (– – – – – – – –)</p>
         <p>To which amount of money to my credit I now add, the first of a Sett of Bills on CMS. for ₤38.6.6 (– – – – – – – –), and the follg. order—which I will thank you to get executed as speedily as possible.—</p>
         <p rend="center">
            <hi rend="italic">Order.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>— — — —</p>
         <p>— — — —</p>
         <p>— — — —</p>
         <p>Please let all the goods be of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> qualy., &amp; as near to order as possible—as the white settlers are beginning to flow into this District, any such little Books as you formerly sent will now be of service. I have distributed nearly all those you so kindly furnished.</p>
         <p>Since my last to you I have recd. yours of June 24/51, notifying your receipt of mine enclosing the Bill for ₤34.11.10.—From your remarks in that Letter of yours, I hope soon to receive the goods therein alluded to. The newspapers mentioned have not come to hand. In future address to care of B. &amp; H.</p>
         <p>There is still a Letter of mine to you unnoticed, dated Novr. 7/50—</p>
         <p>I am greatly afraid that I shall never be able to do any thing with “<hi rend="italic">Deane’s Mill</hi>” &amp; <hi rend="italic">Dressg. Machine.</hi> We have spent no little time over it, but up to the present can make nothing of it.—I must, howr., try again.—</p>
         <p>Be sure to remember me with some reviews Lity. Gazettes, only “8d. ea” &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
         <p>We are very busy preparing to receive the Bp., who is to be here next week—so that I have scarcely time to write.</p>
         <p>Let me have a line fm. you on receipt of this. I close in haste.</p>
         <p>Believe me, ever sincerely yrs<lb/>  W.C.</p>
