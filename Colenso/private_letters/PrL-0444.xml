         <p rend="end">Napier, Feby. 15, 1881.</p>
         <p>R.B. Gore, Esq.<lb/>Secretary, Col. Museum,</p>
         <p>Dr. Sir,</p>
         <p>In a letter I wrote to you a short time ago, I said, that I would go regularly through our Library, and see what serials we have of those published by your Department, and let you know what we are deficient in:—this I now do.—</p>
         <p>Having your printed “List” before me, (on cover of a recent publication of yours— “Manual of N.Z. Mollusca”,) I take that as a kind of guide, and, therefore, will not ask for any of those publications which you thereon say are “out of print”. Bearing this in mind I shall only want just <hi rend="italic">four</hi> of those small works—to make our series of them tolerably complete: viz.—<lb/>No. 10. “Progress Geologl. Survey of N.Z., 1874–76”.<lb/> ʺ  9. “Museum &amp; Laby. Report, 1878–79.”<lb/> ʺ  14. “Meteorological Report, 1877–78.”<lb/> ʺ  7. “Catalogue of Land Shells, 1873.”</p>
         <p>In addition, however, I have another Work to enquire after, which is not mentioned in the said “List”, (that is, its back numbers,) viz. “Palæontology of New Zealand”: by Tennison-Woods. Of this little useful and pleasing Work, I have lately received from you, “part IV.”—and would beg you to send me copies of parts I–III. Indeed I have never seen or heard of this work before: and the Librarian at the Athenæum on receiving part <hi rend="underline italic">IV</hi>. Has been making similar enquiries of me.—</p>
         <p>Last week I hurriedly sent to you our “Proceedings”, Lists of Members, &amp;c., in conformity with your telegram: I hope you received them all right. May I request you to see that the <hi rend="italic">names</hi> of members are spelled correctly: there were a few small errors in spelling on a former occasion (no doubt, typographical ones).</p>
         <p>With this I purpose sending you copies of our Annual report, which is now in the Printer’s hands.</p>
         <p>When you write kindly give me Capt. T. Broun’s address,—</p>
         <p>I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso,</p>
         <p>Hon. Secy., H. B. P. Inst.</p>
