         <p rend="end">Napier Decr. 3 1891</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Your kind L. of 29 ult. is to hand (on 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) and I must <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to write—if only to ease <hi rend="italic">my mind</hi>. I may truly say (w. David) “I <hi rend="italic">am distressed for thee</hi>” &amp;c. the portion of yours respecting yrself. (such <hi rend="italic">unexpected</hi> treatment from “L. &amp; B.,” &amp; then from “Herald” Co.) upsets me, &amp; I feel I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> at present advise: only <hi rend="underline italic">do nothing rashly</hi>: viz. w. ref. to<hi rend="italic">yr. removing</hi> to any place, whether N. or S.—I hope to hear of your having made some arrgt. w. Blundell, <hi rend="italic">as you say</hi>. It is pleasing however to find yourself &amp; family so far well &amp; free from this <hi rend="italic">prevalent </hi>&amp; injurious epidemic: you give me sad accounts of your acqs. &amp; sc. friends!—Such however may prepare you to hear that I too have been <hi rend="italic">brought very low</hi>: I suppose I have never had <hi rend="italic">such an attack</hi> since you &amp; I became acqd.—it was well I wrote my “supply.” note to you when I did. (on 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>). On 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to take 2 S. at Aug’s., though unfitted—then suffg. from a 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> relapse of this Influenza—but there was no help for it—save, <hi rend="italic">No</hi> S. besides, its being <hi rend="underline italic">our</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">last</hi> Sy. of the year, &amp; I had given special notice on the <hi rend="italic">preced</hi>g. Sy. (Evg. S.) of it, &amp; that I looked for a good Congn. &amp;c.—I was the more constrained to go: I managed pretty well the <hi rend="italic">mg</hi>. S. but utterly broke down at <hi rend="italic">Evg</hi>. S.—had to leave 4 times for vestry &amp; try cold w. &amp; Gowing’s Linctus (the Congn. large &amp; sympathising, &amp;c) I went thro the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi>. S.,—w. <hi rend="italic">no</hi> cough nor hindrance in sermon, wh. was rather longer than normal, but retd &amp; climbed this hill at IX. in misery—so all nt., &amp; early called in Dr. H.—Poor dear fellow! he too <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> (worse than patient!!) Insomnia &amp;c howr. he came regy. 3 days—then left for S. w. eld. dr.—<hi rend="italic">hoping</hi> (?against hope) transferring patients to Spencer—who has been very regr. ever since: hopes <hi rend="italic">last</hi> week were slight, <hi rend="italic">age agt. me</hi>, &amp; disorder changed on 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>, <hi rend="italic">to severe</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">bronchitis</hi>.—(you have <hi rend="italic">well</hi> sketched it—as from Sir M. MacKenzie, &amp; <hi rend="italic">patients</hi> there at Wgn). However I think I may say, that fav. symps. <hi rend="italic">commenced</hi> on Wednesday 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>, and so I am wtg. <hi rend="italic">to you</hi>.</p>
         <p>I cannot say much more at present. Parkinson is <hi rend="italic">still holdg</hi>. out: he told me on 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> that day was his last Sy. on earth—he was resigned <hi rend="underline italic">&amp; happy</hi>. I gave his last words &amp; blessing to the Congn., &amp; held <hi rend="italic">a spl. prayer</hi> for him, (&amp; for their shortcomings during ’91) after service.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> only knows whether I shall ever take Ch. duty again—“<hi rend="underline italic">His w. be done</hi>”: I managed to scrawl a note to Engd. having <hi rend="italic">no friend </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">here</hi>. If I keep improving, I hope to go to Bush, but, “at <hi rend="italic">present</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> it, wod. be death.” Mrs Carleton just dead from <hi rend="italic">incautious</hi> exposure at her door. Last Sy., Tuke, <hi rend="italic">mg</hi>., O. Dean <hi rend="italic">evg</hi>. at Augustines: &amp; Welsh is now here from Wairoa, &amp; he (it is hoped) will stay over Sunday. Mrs Hovell, too, confined to bed w. <hi rend="italic">Bronchitis</hi>.</p>
         <p>I send this mgs. H.—as critique on p.4—in <hi rend="italic">your line</hi>. Had you not better cease “Typo” w. ’91? Why should you carry on at <hi rend="italic">loss</hi>? I <hi rend="italic">don’t believe </hi>what is sd. of G.F. Angas (in clippg. sent by you) <hi rend="italic">re</hi> this Colony.—</p>
         <p>If I can I will send a few strange flies recd. from J. Chambers—I cannot do any thing. Eyes <hi rend="italic">so bad</hi> I cannot use c. light scarcely read by dy. lt. <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> our Fr. bless you &amp; yours. W. Colenso.</p>
