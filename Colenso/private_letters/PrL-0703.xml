         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Feby. 8/89.</p>
         <p>Mr. W.W. Yates,</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>This mg. I received your note enclosing small spn. of a plant sent to you from Takapau.</p>
         <p>It is a species of <hi rend="italic">Hypericum </hi>(or “St. John’s Wort”), but <hi rend="italic">not </hi>one of an English species—the largest fine one of them being also known at home by the names of “Tutsan,” and “<hi rend="italic">Park-Leaves</hi>.” This one is a native of Germany, &amp;c. My attention was called to it some 7–8 years ago, when it first appeared at Kopua (near Takapau)—it rapidly &amp; <hi rend="italic">closely</hi> covers the ground to the exclusion of everything, presenting a brilliant and uniform <hi rend="italic">sheet </hi>of golden &amp; yellow flowers. I have warned the residents <hi rend="italic">there</hi>: at the same time, though all the species of <hi rend="italic">Hypericum </hi>are known to be cathartic, I never before heard of its making “cattle drunk.”!!—</p>
         <p>I could not easily give you its <hi rend="italic">specific </hi>name without thorough exam. &amp; trouble, as the genus is a very large one: D’Candolle described above 130 species 50 years ago, and now the number tots up to 200—we have two small (&amp; rather scarce) ones indig. to N.Z.; and my time, just now, is fully occupied, owing to long absence in “Bush” &amp; recent severe illness—but if <hi rend="italic">really</hi> required I could give it.</p>
         <p>Hope you are keeping well; and with kind regards, I am,</p>
         <p>     Dr. Sir, Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Your note is dated “4th”—which, as the enclosed one was dated “5th”, I suppose to be an error.—W.C.</p>
      </body>
