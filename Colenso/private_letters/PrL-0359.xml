         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>Feby. 7, 1878.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I cannot tell you how much I feel indebted to you for your kind letter of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and for the accompanying Papers. I received them last night and have this day gone through them, making a few (a very few) corrections as I went along:—with which, however, I may not be in time.—Some one, I suppose, in the Ptg. Office must have altered my Maori word Kum<hi rend="underline">a</hi>ra to their Kum<hi rend="underline">e</hi>ra,—while, possibly, Hawk<hi rend="underline">e</hi> Bay for Hawk<hi rend="underline">e’s</hi> Bay, sprang from a higher source; as such has been (I regret to say) attempted in our maps, &amp; in the N.Z. Geography: I wrote, last year to Bowden about it, (as he was thinking of getting out a <hi rend="italic">new </hi>edition of the Geography,) begging him to correct it, &amp; to give it (&amp; Cook Strait, &amp;c &amp;c) its <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> orthography. To think of such as King George Sound, Queen Charlotte Sound, Hudson Bay, Mount Bay, St. Andrew College, St. David Head, The Queen Head, King Head, &amp;c &amp;c—only gives me a semi-galvanic shock! Which, I suppose, in <hi rend="italic">my case</hi> is increased through witnessing so much of the wretched <hi rend="italic">patois</hi> maori, in names of places &amp; things!—</p>
         <p>However,—far beyond all that, I (or we) feel greatly indebted to you. As to the <hi rend="italic">Portraits</hi>, &amp;c.,—I think I will try our photog. here, as to what they will strike off a number for: in England such could be easily and <hi rend="italic">cheaply </hi>managed, not so here. I shall only try for <hi rend="italic">Taiota’s</hi>: Sydney Parkinson’s is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> well done, though it is highly characteristic of a young Quaker, &amp; of the fashion of <hi rend="italic">that time</hi>. The N.Z. Chief is exceedingly well executed, &amp; it is also praised by <hi rend="italic">Forster</hi> as being such a really good likeness.</p>
         <p>You say— “on referring to my former letters you found them marked as <hi rend="italic">answd</hi>. during your absence”:—I did receive an acknowledgement of their arrival, but nothing more; I can, I think, send you <hi rend="italic">those notes</hi>, if you wish it. Od course, had they been “<hi rend="italic">answd.</hi>” I should not have troubled you again.</p>
         <p>I regret I cannot obtain the <hi rend="italic">earlier </hi>vols. of “Trans.” (I had last week heard of this through Kirk.) Of the <hi rend="italic">later vols. </hi>I <hi rend="italic">have 2</hi> copies of each here; I will try at Auckland &amp; at Dunedin, for vols. II. III. &amp; IV.</p>
         <p>You may be <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> correct in your remark as to both dogs &amp; moas being not so ancient as I have supposed:—but, on the <hi rend="italic">moa</hi> I have a little more yet to say—anon.</p>
         <p>I had hoped to spend this autumn among our ferns—as I have long wished to bring out a paper about them, &amp; have been making sundry preparations in that direction:—and the more effectually to do this I had (<hi rend="italic">again</hi>) resigned my off. of Inspr. Schools,—from 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. Decr.—but the Board, just as last year, wont have it at all! Rather, they increase the pay, &amp;c—give the old worn Horse <hi rend="italic">extra oats</hi>, &amp; ribbons &amp; bells, &amp; say, Go on!!—Still I shall hope to do my best this coming winter.</p>
         <p>I am <hi rend="italic">interested in </hi>C. Philips’ paper on the Maori arrow &amp; its propulsion, &amp; possibly may have something to say about it. I was pleased also in seeing your Report on the Gold specns. from Picton. I am, my dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly  W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I had forgotten to ask—If it were <hi rend="italic">within</hi> your Rules,—to allow me to have a few copies of those Papers (say 50) struck off &amp; put up separately:—I, of course, paying for the extra work?—</p>
         <p>I must also hunt up &amp; send you a bit more of <hi rend="italic">good </hi>information <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Danais, I was told it by Sturm,—but he has not yet given it in writing.—</p>
         <p>Ten days ago I found on the trunk of one of my largest acacias, &amp; about 5 feet from the ground,—a remarkably <hi rend="italic">large</hi> Caterpillar of a species apparently new to me: it was quiet, &amp; stretched out: but how it got <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, &amp; what it lives on (seeing there was no vegn. near) is a mystery: I have it under glass, &amp; it has spun its web, &amp; entered into its chrysalis state: we shall see. Tell Dr. Buller this.  W.C.</p>
