         <p>Dear Hans Mortensen</p>
         <p>I have been thinking on you and yours: I hope Mrs. Mortensen’s face is better: weather suddenly cold &amp; windy here this evening.—I am of opinion that <hi rend="italic">every bunch of grapes </hi>on your father-in-law’s vine should be <hi rend="italic">carefully cut off and burnt, so as not to leave a scrap of that blight</hi>, or it may be worse next year.—</p>
         <p>I want a few fruits of the shrub that used to grow very plentifully alongside the road leading to the first bridge, I enclose a leaf of it: I think, Axel cut down some for hop-poles for Mr. Tanner; I dare say you, or your nephew, there with you, will know it; about half-a-teacup full of the berries will be plenty: I thought to find them here, but the trees near me have no fruits on them; <hi rend="italic">put them up roughly, any way</hi>, they will take no harm. I have written a note to your neighbour, Olsen, (which I enclose, and will thank you to let him have it early,) for a few seeds of <hi rend="italic">Maori </hi>shrubs in his garden, and have said to him, to give the little lot to you, so as to come on in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> parcel. I leave here tomorrow for Napier, and will write to you again before long. You have no need to write to me with the seeds.—I want them to send by an early mail to England. Kind regards to you <hi rend="italic">all</hi>. Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. write <hi rend="italic">outside </hi>on your parcel of seeds,— “sample post.”</p>
