         <p rend="end">Napier, Tuesday Evg.<lb/>Sept 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>/87.</p>
         <p>Mr. D.P. Balfour,<lb/>Glenross.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir.—This mg. I received your kind &amp; welcome letter of 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst.—and as there’s a <hi rend="italic">lull</hi> I use it in writing to you—tho’ I have a <hi rend="italic">Dozen</hi> much <hi rend="italic">older</hi> letters to reply to, or plenty of writing work to do, with but little heart to go about it—being <hi rend="italic">heavy </hi>jobs. I feel if I want to get out—awa’ to the Heilands &amp; woods.</p>
         <p>But to your letter:—</p>
         <p>I am glad you have your Vol. XIX &amp; that you like it—What you have read. You are a better &amp; closer <hi rend="italic">reader</hi> than I am for I have scarcely yet looked into that Vol. (save at <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">own papers</hi>, &amp; then for <hi rend="italic">errors</hi> of printer,) I did also, <hi rend="italic">run</hi> over (skipping a <hi rend="italic">lot</hi>! as the boys say,)—a paper near the end by some person <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a member named Blyth, seeing my name had been mentioned by him—&amp; that, too, in rather a <hi rend="italic">curious</hi> kind of way, charging <hi rend="italic">me</hi> with what he calls an error (or worse) where as it is only <hi rend="italic">a quotation</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">not my own</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">words</hi>!!—(see p. 515, 9 lines from bottom and p. 535, 7 lines fron top, <hi rend="italic">refer to my paper</hi>.</p>
         <p>Mentioning errors, in my papers—I have noticed 2—which you can alter in your own Vol.—</p>
         <p>p. 302, 9 lines from bottom, for <hi rend="italic">lining</hi>, read <hi rend="italic">living</hi>
            <lb/>p. 313, 12 lines from top, for <hi rend="italic">outside</hi>, read <hi rend="italic">ostiole</hi>.</p>
         <p>There may be more but those 2 caught my eye.—</p>
         <p>The plate of the <hi rend="italic">Cyathea</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Panax</hi> is poorly done—the lower <hi rend="italic">trunk</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Panax</hi>—right-hand side of picture up to head of the higher big branch—is black and muddy—it should be whitish &amp; smooth, to show the <hi rend="italic">Panax</hi> bark there, it <hi rend="italic">is so</hi> in the photo.—and is so in the drawing at Home in the “Gardener’s Chronicle”,<note xml:id="ftn3-375" place="foot" n="375">
               <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle</hi> Vol. 1, 3rd series, 28 May 1887, p.713</note> where, I see, they have also produced it with its account.</p>
         <p>I am pleased at your <hi rend="italic">again</hi> noticing some <hi rend="italic">novelties</hi>, &amp; hope you may succeed—anon. But I don’t think I shall do <hi rend="italic">so much</hi> in future years as I have done.—it has taken up all my time.</p>
         <p>I am now about finishing my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> paper—Botanical, Crypts for 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Prox.—with <hi rend="italic">another</hi>!</p>
         <p>Little did I think <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were so <hi rend="italic">near to me</hi>—that night of Ormond’s speech: I got awful cold <hi rend="italic">then</hi>! and so did P.D. &amp; James Anderson, Elder, &amp; others,</p>
         <p>Yesty. I was out voting—1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi> to town: missed, so at XI to Hastings, voted there, &amp; back to Clive and voted there, back to town—missed again! <hi rend="italic">Current too strong</hi> so, M.R. Miller &amp; self (who had come back from Hastings, &amp; also Mr. Kinross &amp; another from Takapau,) we two went on to Spit &amp; voted there.—</p>
         <p>I am glad it is <hi rend="italic">over</hi> &amp; that <hi rend="italic">those</hi> I voted for were returned. Am very glad that <hi rend="italic">D</hi> is so well beaten.<note xml:id="ftn3-376" place="foot" n="376"> “A ROWDY GATHERING.  Mr (Arthur) Desmond addressed a meeting in the Gaiety Theatre last night.… The address resolved itself into an advocacy of the establishment of a State bank to buy out the large landholders, and an attack upon ‘scoundrelly bank directors,’ ‘hireling editors,’ and ‘blood-sucking leeches.’ At some times the meeting was in a very jocular humor, and laughed and applauded, but at other times a large section were decidedly aggressive, and several unfortunates who manifested incredulity at what wus being said learned what ‘chuck ’im hout.’ meant.”<hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 22 September 1887.</note> Sorry for Taradale &amp; Petane <hi rend="italic">not knowing better</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Hope good <hi rend="italic">may</hi> came of it all; but am not over sanguine.</p>
         <p>Now I am out of <hi rend="italic">your debt</hi> for letter-writing. <hi rend="italic">First wool</hi>
            <hi rend="underline"> </hi>arrived at port yesterday. Hope you are well.</p>
