         <p rend="end">St. John’s College,</p>
         <p rend="end">15 July 1850.</p>
         <p>William Colenso</p>
         <p>Ch. Miss. Station,</p>
         <p>H. Bay.</p>
         <p>My dear Mr. Colenso,</p>
         <p>Your Letter of 23 February was more than 3 months on the road: and when I received it, it was too late to take any steps to assist you in the very unpleasant affair which your letter relates. I can only hope that it has pleased <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> to appease the tumult, and to bring back your people into their right mind. You will have received, I do not doubt, the advice &amp; assistance of your Archdeacon, who is better able than I am to understand the cause of Native feeling which led to the outbreak. The occurrence is so unusual, I may say, so unexampled in the whole history of the Mission, that I am quite at a loss to account for it, especially as I have not heard any thing of it from Archdeacon Williams. You may perhaps find an opportunity of telling Renata &amp; Katene, that this is not what I expected from them, and that if I thought that my Scholars would often act in this manner, I should break up the School tomorrow.”—</p>

         <p>                       “ Your affectionate Friend &amp;</p>
         <p>                                        Father in Christ,”</p>
         <p>                               (Signed) G.A. N.Zealand</p>
