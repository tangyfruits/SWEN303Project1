         <p>To Donald McLean, Esq,</p>
         <p> Chief N.Z. Ld. Purchase Commissr.</p>
         <p>     &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c,</p>
         <p>       Napier.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have been thinking a good deal of late on the subject of the Native King! and of the “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>” which seems to be in pretty active operation in various parts. And from having been present in your Office when Matena Ruta (Potatau’s messenger (or Minister Plenipotentiary) from Waikato and principal man of the “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>” here,) delivered his message to you, I am desirous of trespassing on your time and thoughts with a few remarks.—</p>
         <p>1. We have evidently two elements now at work—both opposing the British Government; the Native King and the “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>”: the former, an idea of foreign growth; the latter purely aboriginal.—</p>
         <p>2. Yet, in deeming the idea of a Native King of all the New Zealanders as of foreign growth—we should remember, that originally each Principal N.Z. Chief or head of a Tribe had in every sense Kingly power over his own Tribe: and indeed which has been preserved in the Sandwich Islands (whence some of the ancestors of the New Zealanders came,) to the present day. There is therefore no valid reason why in considering the genius of the people (acting under a belief of imminent danger from without) the N.Z. Tribes should not unite under one common leader. Indeed, before the general reception of Christianity, it was no uncommon thing for several Tribes to join and act as one, under one Leader for the purpose of war, offensive or defensive.</p>
         <p>3. A state somewhat parallel obtained among the ancient Britons when invaded by Cæsar and other foreign foes—also the ancient Greeks: when thus banded <hi rend="italic">as one </hi>their opposition was not only very formidable but almost invincible.—</p>
         <p>4. So, especially in a country of such a peculiar mountainous nature as this, and with British Settlers scattered so very widely apart, would such an opposition be formidable, and if once provoked, not easily subdued. The more so from the very <hi rend="italic">materiel</hi> which is every where made use of, (or abused,) viz. the Christian Religion and Native Christian Teachers, to carry out the designs of the Native King and the “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>”.—</p>
         <p>5. The Native King (in my opinion) has really but small power, especially at a distance from his own Tribe:—this element has most to do with the Principal Native Chiefs.—</p>
         <p>6. Every Principal Native Chief might be sedulously told that he is (as far as is, or can be, possible or requisite,) as a King to his own Tribe; his native jealousy and pride should be touched: <hi rend="italic">divide et impera.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>7. The “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>,” however, has a very great power—mainly owing to its being a purely Native idea—a resuscitated germ which has lain latent in the Native mind—and has extensive and growing influence over <hi rend="italic">all</hi>—men women &amp; children—of course, for good or for evil.—</p>
         <p>8. It has been commonly used throughout Polynesia—much like the <hi rend="italic">tapu</hi>: hence, from the introduction of Christianity the New Zealanders were always inclined to assemble in <hi rend="italic">bodies</hi>, whether for friendly visiting parties, prayers, schools, marriages, Baptisms, burials, or selling Lands; often patiently enduring no small amount of inconvenience and expense. All matters done “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>”-fashion (“<hi rend="italic">i te aroaro o te tokomaha</hi>”) have ever been considered binding.—</p>
         <p>9. Now this “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>” power and authority should be noted, and its sinews cut.</p>
         <p>10. If the beast is too strong or too ferocious or too wily or too impenetrable to be attacked openly, it should be done by stealth. The fierce Elephant is ham-strung: the wild bull noosed with the lasso.—</p>
         <p>11. If we can’t do what we would, we must do what we can.</p>
         <p>12. The different Christian Ministers in the Country should oppose it. If not as treasonable, certainly as chimerical &amp; impracticable, and also inexpedient and highly against the welfare of the Native race.—</p>
         <p>13. A <hi rend="italic">competent </hi>person (or persons) should, I think, attend those “<hi rend="italic">Runangas</hi>” on the part of the Government; but <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, however, as a Gazetted Government Officer. Such a person would effect much in a quiet way. The Natives dearly love “talk”, and are always generally pleased at Whites being present at their Meetings.</p>
         <p>14. Through such person the Government would also know their <hi rend="italic">real </hi>Native friends; and timely learn the hatching of any secret designs.—</p>
         <p>15. If English Law (or a portion of it) could be dispensed “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>”-fashion, (i.e. by an itinerant Magistrate, or <hi rend="italic">R.M.</hi>, acting in concert with the Chief of each Tribe, and openly and at his Native Village hearing cases &amp; giving judgment,) such would tend to remove much existing discontent.—</p>
         <p>16. <hi rend="italic">If possible </hi>His Excellency should see much more of the Principal Native Chiefs; both at Auckland and <hi rend="italic">among their respective Tribes. </hi>Like Privy Councillors at home and other highly privileged persons they think they ought to have a Common Right of Entrance, &amp;c.—This is the universal feeling of all Tribal peoples; whether the Polynesian, or African, or N. American Indian be considered, or the more highly civilised inhabitants of the Chinese &amp; Russian Empires—they all wish to see, and talk with their “Great Father.” (It was the unintentional lack of this which made the serious revolt against David, &amp; raised the cry—“We have no part in David:—to your tents O Israel!”—) Hence, too, it was that many of the <hi rend="italic">old </hi>Missionaries had such an amount of influence, even in hard &amp; trying times; and for want of this many of the <hi rend="italic">newer </hi>ones fail, notwithstanding their entering on prepared ground.—Soft words welling from the depths of the human soul and the warm hand of man effects as much now as in the days of Jesus Christ. The wild man invariably falls before little acts of kindness oft repeated with firmness, as well as the wild horse before Rarey.—the <hi rend="italic">suaviter in modo </hi>should ever be united with the <hi rend="italic">fortiter in re.</hi>—</p>
         <p>17. If such could not be granted—not a little might be done through a small yet valuable <hi rend="italic">yearly </hi>present to each principal Chief—say, a saddle—or a suit of Clothing—a plaid—a gun, or a bag of shot. Such should also be given accompanied with a letter <hi rend="italic">in answer to an application from the Chief</hi>—which might easily be effectd through the agency of a well-disposed Minister, or of a Competent Person (par. 13), or of that of a Native Land Purchase District Commissioner.—</p>
         <p>18. All Native Christian Teachers should be restrained from assisting publicly at any “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>”: at all events (<hi rend="italic">if ever allowed</hi>) they should be strictly confined to their own village or Tribe. <hi rend="italic">This is of principal importance. </hi>Only keep back the Native Christian Teachers from interfering or helping the “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>” movement and the whole scheme will soon fall. There are many ways of doing it:—1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. By the Minister representing it as not being seemly:—2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. By merely telling him, that <hi rend="italic">while he so acts at the “runanga” he must not conduct Divine Service</hi>, as his passions will be too much excited:—or, 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. By finding him congenial employ in another direction while the “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>” is sitting:—or, 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. By sending him (“out of harm’s way,”) N. or S. avisiting at such periods.</p>
         <p>19. It is a grossly mistaken notion, that the presence of the Native Teachers at modern “<hi rend="italic">Runangas</hi>” serves to keep order &amp; promotes good: keep <hi rend="italic">outward </hi>order of a certain kind they may, but no real good is promoted by their presence at such assemblies. Unless in cases where they are <hi rend="italic">well-known to be opposed to the Native King &amp; “Runanga” movement</hi>, but such Native Teachers would <hi rend="italic">not </hi>attend.</p>
         <p>20. The Natives should generally and speedily be shewn, that <hi rend="italic">there is no necessary connexion whatever between the Christian Religion and the “Runangas”</hi>:—disabuse the Native mind on this point and a great end is gained. Here, however, great caution must be used—unless the Ministers generally oppose the “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>”; for, it must be confessed, that it is here where the main difficulty lies. The union between Religion &amp; Justice is <hi rend="italic">natural</hi>: the Natives think themselves unjustly treated, with more injustice looming in the distance:–<hi rend="italic">ergo </hi>the connexion in their minds between Religion &amp; the Runanga.</p>
         <p>21. I cannot conceive of much (if any) difficulty in getting the Episcopal Ministers thus to act in union; for, certainly the Bishops must see some of the many evils which would necessarily follow the encouraging or fostering (however indirect) such a mad scheme. I venture to suggest, that the Government should lose no time in making application in the proper quarter.—</p>
         <p>22. Evil minded or thoughtless Whites, using treasonable or highly exciting or false language to the Natives (as to the designs of the British Government), should be hunted up &amp; made examples of. No rank or office or age should be allowed to screen an individual so acting.</p>
         <p>23. In carrying out all, or any of the foregoing ideas, I think it should ever be studiously borne in mind, <hi rend="italic">to take no notice whatever of the Native King or of the “Runanga</hi>”; not only, not to acknowledge them or their acts or doings, but generally to act as if such were not in being or not of the least importance. <hi rend="italic">Never enquire after them in any direct way</hi>: and, when they are spoken of, <hi rend="italic">never betray the least desire to hear or know. </hi>Such conduct is sure to be reported &amp; sure to <hi rend="italic">tell. </hi>Hence, while ever steadily opposing both Native King and “<hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>” <hi rend="italic">indirectly</hi> in the “Maori Messenger,” I would <hi rend="italic">never do so directly. </hi>The Native race are very shrewd, and are ever ready to take immense jumps in the opposite direction. They hate to have their own important doings taken little notice of; a continuation of such conduct is sure to make them give them up. But let their suspicions be really once aroused, and one might just as well ask a rat to enter a trap!—</p>
         <p>Here, my dear Sir, I must conclude. I have many other duties, and I have already written more than I intended, but the subject is a most important one to us all, and I have not anything like exhausted all of it. Believe, I pray, in my zeal and faithfulness, although, it may be, I am incorrect in some of my conclusions.</p>
         <p>     I am,</p>
         <p>             My dear Sir</p>
         <p>                     With every respect</p>
         <p>     Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>                     William Colenso.</p>
