         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>As I purpose leaving town tomorrow for the Bush, I write you a few lines tonight; I expect to be away till about 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> November. I wish to get a few Crypts in fruiting state (and I ought to have gone earlier)—I have been <hi rend="italic">very busy</hi>—only this day sent off last papers &amp;c, to Dr Hector; Last week I sent him two teeth of a small <hi rend="italic">mammal</hi>, dug up from 117 feet in sinking an arte­sian well;—of them I hope to hear something anon.</p>
         <p>We held our ordinary meeting last week—I had plenty to do &amp;c—I sent you a D.T. containing a pretty fair outline of our meeting. I was very tired at 11.30pm.</p>
         <p>I suppose you were down to the show of stock. I did not go, I was too busy at home—the Rheumatism &amp;c, of August &amp; part of Sept threw me back consider­ably.</p>
         <p>Keep a good look out for your <hi rend="italic">Divott Plants</hi>—mine have flowered,—3 plants did so, and by daily watching I secured fair specimens;—but I wish to see others; and should yours flower, leave two or more stems for to seed, as I wish also to see the seed pods. I have a portion of an old seed pod from the Bush. As you say, it is difficult to get at these plants in their own <hi rend="italic">home</hi>—I think I shall try some of the Bush where men are felling timber trees—that is, not this visit of mine to Bush, but my next trip (a month or five weeks hence) after our meetings are <hi rend="italic">over</hi> for the season.</p>
         <p>Should yours flower &amp; you dry me a specimen or two, just take out the flower­ing specimen as <hi rend="italic">low down</hi> as <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> (it has a bract at its very base), &amp; dry it within leaves of any book, not pressing it much.</p>
         <p>I suppose you have not commenced shearing yet. Weather here delightfully fine of late, with gentle rain now &amp; then—the whole of Napier looking charm­ing in her spring garments.</p>
         <p>Hope you are all pretty well, I am, at present, and with kindest regards </p>
         <p>                     am Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                     Wm Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Were I not going to the Bush (in a manner <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to go), I should go to Springfield for a few days. My old friend P.D. has been here to catch me,—but, duty <hi rend="italic">first.</hi>
