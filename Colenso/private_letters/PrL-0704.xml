         <p rend="end">Napier, Febry. 12/89.</p>
         <p>Mr. D. P. Balfour, <lb/>Glenross.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yesterday I received your long-looked for letter of Feby. 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>!! in answer (as <hi rend="italic">you say</hi>) to mine of Nov. 13th. For many reasons (some of which you assign) I must not be vexed with you—but I must tell you, that your <hi rend="italic">first</hi> one is a very poor &amp; unworthy one—viz. that “you did not know my address” (in Bush)—and so, nearly all others—in N.Z. &amp; at Home,—yet, addressed to me at Napier they all <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> came on to the Bush!.</p>
         <p>I assure you, you were often in my mind—more so <hi rend="italic">after</hi> I heard of Mr. Kinross’ failures (which <hi rend="italic">greatly grieved me</hi>) and then I <hi rend="italic">slightly</hi> feared you might be a loser—but <hi rend="italic">not to the</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">extent</hi> I have since seen in the papers—which, for your sake, <hi rend="italic">I would hope is not quite true.</hi> I can easily perceive how <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi> you have been bothered &amp; worried since that event took place—<hi rend="italic">a sad beginning of New Year for you</hi>.</p>
         <p>I was very well in the Bush—<hi rend="italic">lost Rheumatism</hi>!! for 3–4 last weeks there, &amp; so returned. But was at <hi rend="italic">once</hi> laid up, confined to bed, (5 days, &amp; <hi rend="italic">kept low</hi>) <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Rheumatism—which however has since returned with the change to rain, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Am tolerably well. Have <hi rend="italic">lost much</hi> time—must work hard. Excuse this short rote. Hope your increase may prove an additional blessing.</p>
         <p>Kind regards, Yrs. truly, </p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I have not seen P.D. for 3 months!!! but received a <hi rend="italic">nice long </hi>letter from him.</p>
