         <p rend="end">NAPIER NOV 16th 1885 </p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>It is late &amp; I am tired (writing) but before I go to bed I will write to you, to thank you for your welcome letter (w packet of Orchids) of the 8th inst.—A good letter, and flowers in first rate condition—and have been admired by several, indeed I sent over 2 of each (of the <hi rend="italic">Corysanthes</hi> &amp; the green <hi rend="italic">Pterostylis</hi>) to the Mayors lady Mrs Spencer.</p>
         <p>If you should have any more of this <hi rend="italic">Pterostylis</hi>—that <hi rend="italic">you can spare</hi>, I could take them for preserving in spirits for England; this Pt is <hi rend="italic">Pt patens</hi>, Col. (my description drawn up <hi rend="italic">last year</hi> &amp;, I suppose, will be published with the other plants, in Vol XVIII. Your <hi rend="italic">Corysanthes</hi>—was your old one, <hi rend="italic">C. papillosa</hi> (Trans XVII ), and the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">Thelymitra</hi>, very near to <hi rend="italic">T. nemoralis</hi> (Trans XVII) and to a Tasmanian sp, <hi rend="italic">T. nuda</hi>, but not agreeing with any; these are very troublesome things to <hi rend="italic">decide</hi> on,—differences in this <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> mainly depending an microscopical belongings to the <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> column, in which are the Anther a Stigma &amp;c &amp;c. I wish, too, that I had more of this; as it is shy in opening flowers. I have <hi rend="italic">tried hard</hi> with these, and only on one day, did I succeed in getting 2 flowers to expand, and it has taken up some of my time—but <hi rend="italic">I cannot</hi> always be quill driving.</p>
         <p>I greatly wish you could get me a spn or two of that peculiar long stalked &amp; slender Orchid of last year.</p>
         <p>Our last meeting will he held early in Dec. when a Botanl. paper of mine will be read (perhaps my last!!)—&amp; anything new that I can get <hi rend="italic">in time</hi> will be included. Mr Hill brought me a new plant from P. Bay, and I have had some from Bush (a few <hi rend="italic">small</hi> novelties,) but the main part of my paper was written <hi rend="italic">last</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">summer</hi>—at Xmas time.</p>
         <p>Of course you saw in the “Herald”, a report of our last meeting—a wretched relation; one wonders who wrote (or supplied) it. There was <hi rend="italic">no</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">reporter</hi> present, for that day being <hi rend="italic">high Holiday</hi> they were better-engaged.—The meeting was continued to a late hour. I was obliged to say (and read) a great deal; indeed, nearly all the work (again) fell on me. <anchor type="bookmark-start" xml:id="id_OLE_LINK7"/>Hamilton went off to the Bush—on W side of Ruataniwha—on the Friday eve, &amp; was to have returned by Monday mgs train—but he only came <hi rend="italic">late</hi>—nearly 7pm. He brought however several pleasing spns. <ptr type="bookmark-end" target="#id_OLE_LINK7"/>There were but a few present; and <hi rend="italic">none</hi> of those you &amp; I think should be there—save Mr Hill &amp; Mr Locke.</p>
         <p>With you I regret the death of your dear little mouse, especially under such untoward circumstances. I can send you more of that fern—if you wish to have them. I shall show it (w others) at our next meeting. I wish we had ½ of your <hi rend="italic">rain</hi>, we want it <hi rend="italic">badly</hi>, things <hi rend="italic">here</hi> on this hill are <hi rend="italic">pe­rishing</hi>. I am glad to find my old friend P.D. back again, but have not seen him yet. Does your mail go <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> a week now.</p>
         <p>Good Bye. Believe me Dr Sir</p>
         <p>Yours very truly<lb/>W. Colenso</p>
