         <p rend="end">Napier, Sunday,<lb/>Octr. 16, 1881.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yesterday I managed to finish my job—of making a fair copy of Appx. II. to my last Paper: which will be sent to you tomorrow (with this) <hi rend="italic">in a registered packet</hi>. Of course I knew, that the steamer calling here on her way S. would not arrive till tomorrow. I hope you may find time to read what I now send you,—you will, I think, gather a few new things therefrom. Towards the end of my Paper, I have written “protoxide”, with penciled queries in margin—Peroxide, or Red oxide: which I wish you to decide for me.—</p>
         <p>You may probably think I have written rather <hi rend="italic">ex cathedra </hi>in Appx. II.,—but I wish to put a stop (if possible) to all such sciolist attempts,—or, I foresee, great mischief will endure hereafter when I am <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>. I have omitted a small portion of still stronger language, which I had used at our meeting; for I had often nursed Stack when a squalling brat! and knew him and his parents <hi rend="underline italic">well</hi>. I fancy Stack has been a kind of Triton among minnows <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Mao. matters, with the <hi rend="italic">savards</hi> of ChristCh., (no one <hi rend="italic">there</hi> knowing any thing of the Maoris,)—I am sure that he (formerly) led Haast astray in some Maori subjects: and so, I think, I told H. in a note at the time, or, at all events, to be careful, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>At our Ordinary Meeting here on Monday night, last, I privately asked the Bishop (Chm.) of those “Maori Scholars at the N. who, also, had found great fault with Stack’s paper”: he told me that Archd. Williams was one of them, and he would have told me more but we were interrupted,—I having then <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> to attend to.</p>
         <p>Last night, or early this mg., in bed and no sleep,—I took up the last no. to hand of Conty. Review (Augt./81), and read Dr. Fairbairn’s paper on Herbert Spencer’s Philosophy. I was very much struck with some of his words—<hi rend="italic">plain</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">&amp; strong</hi>: so<hi rend="italic"> </hi>suitable, so like some of my own very lately written in Appx. II., &amp; now sent to you. I quote a bit, that you (if you have not read it,) may look there for more, (not, however, that I wholly agree with Dr. Fairbairn) “That must be a bad philosophy of the universe which most signally fails to understand &amp; scientifically interpret the humanist &amp; most universal facts in history. It is hardly too much to say, that the most signal failure in this respect is Mr. Herbert Spencer. I speak, of course, of attempts made since such a thing as scientific method existed, &amp; within these limits what I have said I soberly and seriously mean. Were he simply an ethnographer, he would deserve no such censure—even very considerable praise,” &amp;c, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>I suppose you will have received my last letter <hi rend="italic">re </hi>2 teeth, &amp;c., before this. I purpose leaving N. for 40 m. Bush, on Tuesday next, 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.—I ought to have gone thither before, as there are 2 or 3 we Crypts. I wish to get in fruit, &amp; some other things. I hope, however, to be back by the end of this month.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">This day</hi>! 112 years ago, Cook &amp; his celebrated band of Naturalists were here in this Bay;<hi rend="italic"> </hi>and that disastrous affair took place, which gave its name to Cape <hi rend="italic">Kidnappers</hi>! I have been (<hi rend="italic">again</hi>—as often before) trying to realise the events of that day.</p>
         <p>And with best regards,</p>
         <p>Believe me, to be,</p>
         <p>sincerely yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I may tell you—that I have been working hard towards getting a suitable room to call <hi rend="italic">entirely our own</hi>, &amp; hope to succeed.—</p>
