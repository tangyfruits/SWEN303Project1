         <p>Gentlemen</p>
         <p>In accordance with a letter of instructions lately to hand from Mr A. Luff of London, I have this day directed 7 cases of Stationery which arrived here ex “Madeleine” to be shipped to your address &amp; Care per “Kiwi” which leaves here tomorrow for Wellington, and I enclose Invoice and English Bill of lading of the same, received by me from Dinwiddie &amp; Co. of this town, to whom the 7 cases were originally consigned. Mr. Luff informed me in his letter that he had written to you concerning these goods. I have a 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. copy of Invoice, &amp; of Bill of lading which I will also forward if you wish it.</p>
         <p>                                             I am, Gentlemen,</p>
         <p>                                                     Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                                                     (sgd.) W. Colenso.</p>
