         <p>Mr D. Black<lb/>  Clyde, Wairoa,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir, On my return from the Country (from my last round as School Inspector) in the beginning of this month,—I found your letter of 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. April here, with many others, awaiting me. I could not however find time to reply to it by last Tuesday’s Mail, and I will now try to do so.</p>
         <p>With reference to Mr Luff’s piece of land there at Wairoa, you say— “it would have been more satisfactory if you had been informed (by me) what difference there was between you.”—and so, no doubt, it would, but <hi rend="italic">I could not </hi>tell you any more: <hi rend="italic">I do not know </hi>what price Mr Luff has set upon it. I know one thing, that he is a pretty good judge in all such matters, and that he is willing to sell it for what he considers a fair price.</p>
         <p>As you say,—there is little chance (now that I am out of office) of my visiting Wairoa, otherwise I would go &amp; look at the Land with you, &amp; give you my opinion upon it,—but, as that cannot be, I would recommend you to make a fair or <hi rend="underline italic">good</hi> offer for it, and I will send it to Mr Luff: more than this I cannot say.                             I am &amp;c</p>
         <p>                                                             (signed) W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. I can well understand that while you are delaying about it, another may jump in &amp; your chance is <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>!               W.C.</p>
