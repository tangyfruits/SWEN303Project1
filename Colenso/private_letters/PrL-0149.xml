         <p>My dear McLean,</p>
         <p>A few days ago I gave you the Nat. news; promising you a <hi rend="italic">tracing</hi> of the Land I am getting laid out at Napier, which I now enclose: the tracing is rather rough, but correct; the Land will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be opened for sale for 2 or 3 weeks (depending on the Surveyor), so that if you care to have any of the best sections (all ¼ ac.), you will be in time. I consider the situation the best in the Island, while it is <hi rend="italic">retired</hi> &amp; in the <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> of Town. And as I (&amp; Dr. H.<note xml:id="ftn2-48" place="foot" n="48"> Dr Thomas Henry Edward Hitchings, appointed Native Medical Officer at Napier in 1857.</note> and others) wish it to be respectable, I have planned it so as to have no thoroughfare, &amp; given for a belt of Trees, &amp;c.—“<hi rend="italic">Banks</hi>”—after Sir Jos. B. who came with Cook, &amp; published (&amp;, indeed, brought out Draughtsmen with him at his own expense!) &amp; “<hi rend="italic">Hooker</hi>”, after our N.Z. Flora Botanist.</p>
         <p>—A little stir was among the Natives last week; Hapuku heard (“<hi rend="italic">from soldiers</hi>” travelling) that he was about to be attacked, &amp; immediately all collected within their new pa: while K. and Renata, hearing that Hap. was coming to attack them, collected all their forces <hi rend="italic">again</hi> at Pakiaka, and were preparing to march to Pakipaki there to lie in ambush, when Wi (Harawira Tatere’s son) came down from Poukawa (<hi rend="italic">accidentally</hi>), &amp; stopped them by telling how things really were: when they vented their <hi rend="italic">Piri</hi> in a great deal of firing.— — —</p>
         <p>Two days ago I addressed the B. of Magistrates (granting Publican’s Licenses)—on the subject of selling to Natives, and, on that of the Evils arising from the 2-gall. <hi rend="italic">whole sale </hi>(!!) Ordinance: H. Russell &amp; Col. Wyatt were on the Bench.</p>
         <p>Believe me, <lb/>  Yours truly, W. Colenso.</p>
