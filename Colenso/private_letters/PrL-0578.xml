         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>October 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1884</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Last Saturday (11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) I received your kind and full reply (dated 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>) to my enquiries re Pterostylis trullifolia, and I thank you for it,</p>
         <p>I note what you tell me in the close of your letter: viz.—</p>
         <p>“I am sorry that I find it impossible to accept as distinct species most of the plants you have described in the recent volumes of the “Handbook”. (Trans. N.Z. Inst.,<hi rend="italic"> intended</hi>)—</p>
         <p>I may remark, that I have long known this, such having been repeatedly told me: and while, to a certain degree, I regretted it, still it makes little or no difference,—that is, <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>. Of one thing I am pretty certain, that if you <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> those plants I have laboured to describe, you would, I think, alter your judgment concerning, at least, some of them: and further, that even in those instances in which I may be wrong, (although I am not conscious of <hi rend="italic">any</hi>,) I shall not have laboured in vain; because I have brought forward in every case certain characters that had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been noticed in the descriptions originally given of the species to which such may belong, and therefore will be of service to working Botanists in assessing their specific descriptions hereafter.—</p>
         <p>I have more than once thought that you were not fully conversant with some of our flora, especially of the Crypts. Probably you lack the opportunities of observing them in their habitats and of getting them, and of time for that purpose, (and such <hi rend="italic">does</hi> require <hi rend="italic">much time</hi>,) seeing your ever-growing official duties must be both heavy and constant.</p>
         <p>However, this may be, my dear Sir,—continue to make what remarks you please on my work—it shan’t break squares between us: only don’t use a rusty lancet.</p>
         <p>I propose leaving Napier on Tuesday 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, for the woods, a 3 weeks sojourn, my usual annual spring visit. I ought to have gone last week, but was hindered.—</p>
         <p>             Believe me to be,</p>
         <p>                             Yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                                             W. Colenso.</p>
