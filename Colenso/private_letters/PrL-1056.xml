         <p rend="end">Napier, July 19<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, 1898</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>I duly received your kind letter of the 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., and thank you for it, (doubly so, I may truly say) as by it I knew you had <hi rend="italic">all </hi>got back safely, with no unpleasant consequences: good news that in these times.—</p>
         <p>But I should not be writing to you this night, only for one grave omission of yours—viz. your <hi rend="italic">not </hi>returning the copy of my letter to Costall late Govt. Printer, and more, nor even mentioning it!! as having been received by you, and, your showing it (if approved by you) to Mr. Mackay: the <hi rend="italic">entire</hi> omission of this on your part was like the proverbial fly in the apothecaries ointment, and so I feel constrained to write to you: please return it: also, <hi rend="italic">another letter </hi>I sent to you some time ago, from Costall in G.A. Liby., for you to read and return: please <hi rend="italic">return this</hi>. And while on it I may <hi rend="italic">again </hi>mention, that <hi rend="underline italic">early</hi> printer’s letter, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>some old type sold to him, which I also sent for you to read—<hi rend="italic">never yet returned</hi>: I often think on (grieve over) this!—</p>
         <p>I thank you for your kind remarks on specimen Maori-Eng. Lexicon, letter A. On <hi rend="italic">two </hi>of them I will briefly remark. Your correction of “<hi rend="italic">guana</hi>” to “<hi rend="italic">iguana</hi>”: I find Webster has <hi rend="italic">both</hi>, and that <hi rend="italic">without </hi>a yoking obsn., as in many other instances, such as connection = connexion, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Again do I agree with you in your <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> remark on <hi rend="italic">sudden </hi>death, &amp; disagreeing with the suffrage in Litany, Ch. of E. Indeed, I have not infrequently mentioned it in a sermon—especially at Woodville on the finding of poor Weber’s bones! I dare not pray <hi rend="italic">vocally </hi>for it for myself—but, If “p. is the soul’s sincere <hi rend="italic">desire</hi>, uttered or inexpressed”—then Our Father knows all: but who is the <hi rend="italic">author </hi>of such?</p>
         <p>I took w. me, in May, a copy of booklet “Certain errors”, &amp; read it through, &amp; was vexed on finding one (ugly) error—p.7, line 3 from bottom—“<hi rend="underline">ob</hi>taineth” for “<hi rend="underline">con</hi>taineth”: alter it in your copy. On returning to N. I looked up <hi rend="italic">copy for press</hi>—in that page, a <hi rend="italic">reprint</hi> from “Hd.” and found it <hi rend="italic">correct</hi> in the paper. Do you know if Buller’s Birds 2 vols. 4to. are <hi rend="italic">on sale</hi> at Wgn. &amp; if so their <hi rend="italic">price</hi>. I do not like exactly to ask him.—</p>
         <p>Hill read a terribly <hi rend="italic">long </hi>&amp; dry<hi rend="italic"> </hi>paper at last mtg. of Institute: since published <hi rend="italic">in extenso</hi> in Herald in several papers: I tried, but gave it up: it is on “<hi rend="italic">Pensions</hi>”.—</p>
         <p>Do you happen to know whether the Premier has <hi rend="italic">given out </hi>those copies of <hi rend="italic">letter A. </hi>“to Members, &amp; to the High Officers of Govt.”—or, any mention <hi rend="italic">re </hi>same in papers.—</p>
         <p>And now <hi rend="italic">another </hi>old hand in House, dead: <hi rend="italic">Friend</hi>: I knew him <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, when <hi rend="italic">assistant</hi> in my sojourning there.—</p>
         <p>I am keeping pretty well. Fannin has been seriously ill, but is better &amp; in Office.—</p>
         <p>With kind regards,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,                     W. Colenso.</p>
