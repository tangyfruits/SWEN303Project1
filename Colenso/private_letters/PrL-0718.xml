         <p>T.R. Moore, Esq</p>
         <p>Waimarama</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I am in receipt of your note of the 19<hi rend="sup ">th. </hi>inst., with chq. enclosed for <hi rend="italic">£10.10.0</hi>: for both I thank you.—</p>
         <p>But there is, apparently, some error, or misconception, which causes me to write.—</p>
         <p>1. The sum required is “<hi rend="italic">£11.0.0</hi>” (as per Circular issued), including 10/- for binding 2 vols.—</p>
         <p>2. <hi rend="italic">None </hi>came to hand bound in “½-morocco”, &amp;c.—hence I <hi rend="italic">inserted</hi> in Circular— “<hi rend="italic">not arrived</hi>.”</p>
         <p>(<hi rend="italic">I was very unwell at the time</hi>, and so it is quite possible I may have <hi rend="italic">omitted </hi>those two words in the Circular sent to you.)</p>
         <p>Sir W. Buller says, in his <hi rend="italic">last</hi> letter to me, that the Bookbinder had not enclosed in his 3 cases any copies bound in mor. @ 20/-,—simply because he had no room for them. Also:—should any subscriber prefer such, to let him know, and they should be sent:—but, of course, that means some time hence, 6 months or more. I suppose, such would also be bound in 2 vols.</p>
         <p>No other subsr. but yourself has asked about the higher price binding. I may further add, that Sir Walter naïvely says,—he did not see much difference in the appearance of the 2 kinds, though a great difference in their prices.</p>
         <p>I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. If you please, you may send me 10/- (additional) in stamps:—or, when you send for the 2 vols. pay that sum to the young man in charge at Mr. Fannin’s Office.—</p>
         <p rend="end">W.C.</p>
