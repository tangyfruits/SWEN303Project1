         <p>Mr. Hans Mortensen,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>A short time ago I wrote you a letter saying, I hoped to be leaving here for Norsewood <hi rend="italic">next week</hi>, after the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., I <hi rend="italic">now </hi>find, that I shall not be able to do so, therefore I write you early that you may know.—This alteration has only been made <hi rend="italic">this day</hi>, and it is owing to the new Minister for one of our churches in this town not being able to leave Wairoa and come here for (say) 3 Sundays after next Sunday, and so I am called on to fill his place, otherwise the Church would be closed. However, as it is for a good cause, I know well, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Hans, will not complain much, and I do not expect any other matter to crop up after this;—and I will be sure to write to you <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, as the time draws near.</p>
         <p>I hope you are <hi rend="italic">all </hi>well and enjoying fair weather, I have not heard of your going to the Mountains. I am keeping well—a thing to be thankful for,—for, as you have truly said, there is no blessing so great as this of <hi rend="underline italic">good health</hi>, and, add to that, <hi rend="underline italic">a contented mind</hi>, and a man has happiness in this world: but we don’t always know it!!—–The weather here still continues fine, and very warm at times.—</p>
         <p>Kind loving regards to you <hi rend="italic">all </hi>as if separately named, and believe me</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. Don’t fail to let Axel know early.—</p>
