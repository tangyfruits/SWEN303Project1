         <p rend="end">Napier, Tuesday 16th<lb/>9 pm</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your welcome letter of 13th, with two packets, have just been brought in by my man, (who had <hi rend="italic">halted</hi> somewhere on his way back) and as I purpose going to town tomorrow, I must write a line now to cover the stamps I have for you,—though I have little new to say.—</p>
         <p>First, thanks for your kind remembrance of me with spns forwarded.</p>
         <p>My “Egg Shell” fungus is still looking well <hi rend="italic">in its</hi> glass home (under a tum­bler). It has been looked at &amp; marvelled at by some visitors. I am glad to hear of your Orchids showing well­—so with some of mine here in pots; by the bye keep a look-out for your “Divot” ones.</p>
         <p>I have been busy at home for several days, (went to town last week to vote), and have drawn up descriptions of three new Mosses, which have gi­ven me some hours work with the microscope. Last week was my <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> letter writing week.</p>
         <p>The “<hi rend="underline italic">Aorangi</hi>” has arrived at Wgn, &amp; the big case of books for “Instit”, &amp; others in her, &amp; I suppose will soon be here. I hope to receive it &amp; serve out the books before this month runs out, &amp; then I go off to the woods. I daresay I shall write to you again before I go.</p>
         <p>I suppose you saw the notice in the “Herald” of the “Mao Rat” &amp; the “Cut­tle-fish”.<note xml:id="ftn3-258" place="foot" n="258"> The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> reported, “A paper on Maori Rats was to have been read by Mr Sturm, and had been looked forward to with considerable interest by members, owing to Mr Sturm's long residence in the colony and his consequent knowledge of the New Zealand fauna. The reading of this paper, however, had to be postponed on account of Mr Sturm's absence from the meeting. The honorary secretary read a paper ‘On some of the cuttle fish found in Hawke's Bay.’ This proved a very interesting contribution....”</note> Much fun (<hi rend="italic">too much</hi>) in town about it; I don’t think Sturm will like it. M.R. Miller has been very <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> upon me (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> knowing the facts of the case), to “return to my poor family”, &amp;c, &amp;c.<note xml:id="ftn3-259" place="foot" n="259"> MR Miller was a Napier auctioneer. </note>
         </p>
         <p>I feared for the sheep, or the <hi rend="italic">Lambs</hi> on the hills, when I saw the snow low down, &amp; the weather severe, indeed our severe weather has been <hi rend="italic">since</hi> the winter ended; reminding one of the old saying “When the days begin to lengthen, The cold begins to strengthen”.</p>
         <p>I hope your loss may not be very heavy, I fear, too, you &amp; your men had extra &amp; arduous work.</p>
         <p>I got a note from Mr Kinross last week, then he was suffering from Lum­bago—but I saw him in town on that voting day, &amp; he was better. I don’t envy his ride overland to Wgn.</p>
         <p>Hope you are all well &amp; hearty; &amp; with kind regards</p>
         <p> Am, yours very truly</p>
         <p> W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
