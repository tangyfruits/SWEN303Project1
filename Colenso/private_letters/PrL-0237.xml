         <p rend="end">Napier July 18, 1868.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>A short time ago I received a small packet of <hi rend="italic">N. </hi>Botanical specimens from your Col. Museum, for which, I suppose, I am indebted to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. But whether collected by yourself or by Mr. Kirk, I know not, as no note came with them: they have however <hi rend="italic">gratified</hi> me very much. I should have thanked you for them ere this, but I had also <hi rend="italic">previously</hi> received a small packet of Plants from Mr. Kirk, on which he wished my opinion. And as I was about to go through them, I put off writing to you till I should have examined <hi rend="italic">both</hi> lots,—which I have just completed doing.</p>
         <p>I had however written a note to Mr. K. <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I received his parcel of plants, (our communications crossed at sea,) which I had ventured on after reading in the “Weekly News” an interesting paper, entitled, “the Cruise of the Glance”. I informed him in my note, that his <hi rend="italic">Celmisia </hi>from Manaiia, Malvaceous plant (“Hibiscus”) from near N. Cape, were both known before. I now feel doubly obliged to you for your timely remembrance, as the parcel from Mr. K. did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> contain a sp. of the <hi rend="italic">Celmisia</hi> nor of the “<hi rend="italic">Hibiscus</hi>”, which above all others I wished to see.</p>
         <p>Curiously enough I had sent <hi rend="italic">living</hi> specimens of those two plants to Kew Gardens in 1842, in a plant Cabin by H.M.S.S. “Tortoise”. Of the Malvaceous plant I have now no doubt, although it was obtained from the Country between Cape Pococke and the Cavalles Islands,—while of the <hi rend="italic">Celmisia </hi>I have scarcely any doubt, as I got my specimens and several living plants from a high &amp; steep hill a little to the NW. of Mt. Manaiia, (over which the old Maori track formerly led into Parua Bay,) where the plant then grew plentifully but was not in flower. The Malvaceous plant too I never saw in flower of ft. (I had spoken of it as a <hi rend="italic">Sida</hi>,)—but when I left my old garden at Paihia in 1843, the plant was thriving (so was the <hi rend="italic">Celmisia</hi>), but the person who resided there after me cared <hi rend="underline italic">nothing</hi> for plants or gardens.—</p>
         <p>I fear, however, that my <hi rend="italic">living</hi> plants forwarded to Kew of those 2 genera, perished on the passage. They were put in from the garden only the day before sending off the said plant Cabin, the “Tortoise” having suddenly made her appearance in the Bay of Islands from the Thames nearly a month before her time! Fortunately however, the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> plants were all well rooted in their boxes.</p>
         <p>At the same time I sent to Sir W. Hooker dried spns. of the <hi rend="italic">Celmisia</hi>, (poor spns. with old scapes, much like this spn. you have sent me,) and, on my receiving that part of Dr. Hooker’s <hi rend="italic">Fl. </hi>N.Z. which contained the <hi rend="italic">Compositæ </hi>and finding it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> there, I wrote to Dr. H., who, in reply, said, it had been overlooked, was since found, &amp; would be afterwards noticed.—I mention this, as, from Mr. Kirk, I learn, it has been supposed to be <hi rend="italic">C. Munroi </hi>(which it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be, but qu.,)—and <hi rend="italic">that species</hi>, I note, has been made <hi rend="italic">since </hi>the publication of the “<hi rend="italic">Flora</hi>”.</p>
         <p>The little <hi rend="italic">Pittosporum </hi>(elegantissime!), “<hi rend="italic">P. Gilliesianum</hi>” of Kirk, has given me no little work. (Mr. Kirk wished particularly to know about this plant.) I have examined it carefully (hunting up old descriptions by R. &amp; A. Cunningham of their small N. <hi rend="italic">Pittospora</hi>.) and have been obliged (from Book descriptions) to conclude it to be <hi rend="italic">reflexum</hi> of <hi rend="italic">R.</hi> C. I have just written largely to Kirk about it, telling him so, and giving him my reasons. I fear he will be disappointed. It was however wholly <hi rend="italic">new </hi>to me.—</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">Panax </hi>from Whangaroa, said to be a “<hi rend="italic">new</hi> sp.”, is surely <hi rend="italic">P. Lessonii</hi>, or a var. of it;—the specimen however was an imperfect one.</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">little linear-leaved Shrub</hi>, is one I know <hi rend="italic">well</hi>! It caused me many a fruitless hunt year after yare to find it in fl. or ft. I have supposed it to be <hi rend="italic">Santalum Cunninghamii </hi>in a <hi rend="italic">young </hi>state, (not a var.,—although I believe there are vars. or even <hi rend="italic">species</hi> of that genus in N.Z.,) be this as it may, I sent living plants to Kew in ’42.</p>
         <p>Of the larger-leaved specimens of <hi rend="italic">Pittospora</hi>, from Mt. Manaiia &amp; from Whangaroa little can be said, until <hi rend="italic">flowering</hi> specimens are obtained: that from Manaiia may be a <hi rend="italic">sp. nov.</hi>—</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dacrydium </hi>from Whangaroa has also caused me some consideration &amp; search. It may be new, or rather, one of the <hi rend="italic">old </hi>ones now first detected in fruit. I have ever believed that (at least) 2 species are included under <hi rend="italic">D. Colensoi</hi>, of the Flora &amp; Hd.Bk., (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> of Sir W. Hooker’s <hi rend="italic">Icon. Plantm</hi>.,) there may be as many as 3,—(<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">D. Colensoi</hi> (vera) of the N., a middle sized tree,—tab.548, <hi rend="italic">Ic. Plantm</hi>: II. <hi rend="italic">D. </hi>(Podocarpus?) <hi rend="italic">biformis</hi>, of Sir W.J.H., tab.544, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit</hi>., a small tree, 10–12 feet, of Ruahine, &amp;c., which I never found in fruit, only <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> flowers: III. The little lovely <hi rend="italic">erect</hi> sp. of Rangipo (Tongariro), 1–2 ft. high, loaden with fruit:) all this I have long ago told the Hookers. Sir Wm’s. drawing of <hi rend="italic">biformis</hi> (sup.) accords closely with Kirk’s specimen bearing 2 kinds of leaves—the same indeed on the Ruahine plants. Its aggregated fruit brings it near to its closely allied congener the Tasmanian <hi rend="italic">D. Franklinii </hi>(the celebrated Huon Pine), the foliage of which is also very near to <hi rend="italic">D. Colensoi </hi>(vera). Sir W.J.H., in a mote on <hi rend="italic">D. Franklinii</hi> (“Lond. Jl. Bot.”, vol.IV. p.153,) says,— “<hi rend="italic">Dacrydium Colensoi</hi>, to which <hi rend="italic">D. Franklinii </hi>bears a considerable resemblance, produces also several terminal female flowers, but one only ever arrives at maturity”.—I hope however <hi rend="italic">good</hi> spns, m. &amp; f., of this <hi rend="italic">Dacryd. </hi>have been forwarded to Dr. Hooker.</p>
         <p>I did not intend to have said so much on these plants when I began.</p>
         <p>I hope you are quite well, and doing well; it seems long since I last heard from you. I have received Hochstetter’s Eng. work, but have not yet found time to look into it.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
