         <p rend="end">Tuesday night,<lb/>Jany. 17, ’88.</p>
         <p>Mr W.W. Yates,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>On returning <hi rend="italic">late </hi>from town this day (1.45!) I found your interesting &amp; <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter with big specimen awaiting me.—Of course I went for both! tho’ too tired for anything—after so much trotting about town in the sun.—and as I purpose going (once more!) to the Bush next week—I write you now what I know of this plant.</p>
         <p>It has borne (at least) 2 names:—1. <hi rend="italic">Carduus Marianus</hi>, Linn. 2. Silybum Marianum, Vaill., &amp; by D’Candolle in his large standard Botanical work.——</p>
         <p>In English,—it is commonly called Milk Thistle,—Lady’s Thistle,—and Holy Thistle—the Monks, &amp;c., saying, that the white veins, &amp;c., were owing to the V. Mary’s milk having been spilt on it!——</p>
         <p>I saw it here, first, about 25 years ago,—<hi rend="italic">plants of it</hi>, but never before in flower or fruit; it is a biennial. Found in S. Europe, Asia, &amp;c. (naturally) but, of course, follows “civilization”: by some it is denied as being <hi rend="italic">indigenous</hi> to England, &amp; so omitted by <hi rend="italic">some </hi>British Botanists—but not by Hooker <hi rend="italic">Senior</hi>, Sowerby, &amp; others.—–</p>
         <p>There is also a <hi rend="italic">smaller </hi>var. of this plant, in De Candolle, but only 1 sp. of this genus.——</p>
         <p>I am, Dr Sir, Yrs,           W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
