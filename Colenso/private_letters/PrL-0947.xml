         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>Although I have so lately written to you (and that last, too, an <hi rend="italic">extra </hi>issue!) I have to write to you again—and I suppose my subject this time will surprise you!—</p>
         <p>I have just received a kind semi-official letter from the Premier, in which (among other matters) he says, “he shall give instruction to the Govt. Printer to print the portion of the Maori Lexn. (so long ago sent in)—and this is the cause of my writing now to you.—</p>
         <p>But first let me tell you how this <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi> revulsion<note xml:id="ftn3-761" place="foot" n="761">
               <hi rend="italic">Sic</hi>. Perhaps Colenso meant to write “revolution” or “reversal” but Freud would have been delighted with his <hi rend="italic">lapsus scribendi</hi>.</note> has come to pass.—</p>
         <p>I think I must have told you, that Sir Rt. S., &amp; Capt.R., were <hi rend="italic">again</hi> moving in that matter, and had seen Seddon—2–3 times about it during the earlier parts of this P. Session; but little hopes. Stout also saw Carman, (who, I suppose, had something to do in that particular direction,) and C. said, “NO! it would cost £1000. to print it.” (<hi rend="italic">Ignorantly</hi>, I fancy, thinking it was the <hi rend="italic">whole </hi>work!) C. adding,— “Mr. C. can have the ms. by sending for it.” In my writing to Capt. R., <hi rend="italic">after that</hi>,—I said, “£40. would be nearer the cost, of printing that small part,—but whatever it might be I would willingly pay ½ cost, &amp;c.” By &amp; by, in Septr., came a note from S. to Capt. R., saying, “If the cost would not be more than £40, and I would pay <hi rend="italic">half</hi>, the work should be done.” Capt. R. sent on that note to me, remarking that, “I had better reply to it,”—I did so (Septr. 18<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>)—stating, that my mention of £40. was merely a rough guess (not having the copy by me), but that whatever the cost would be, beyond the said £40, I would meet it. I also had the temerity to send S. a copy of my Waikare-moana paper, with a few remarks on his adventurtes there, concluding with,—that I <hi rend="italic">had </hi>had a great mind to go purposely to Wgn. to <hi rend="italic">see him</hi> &amp; plead for the ptg. of my Ms. “A.”, inasmuch as <hi rend="italic">we </hi>two had been peculiar sufferers at that Lake. Well, time rolled on, &amp; I supposed—nothing more would be heard of it, and possibly I had given offence to S. for my <hi rend="italic">free </hi>remarks (if he ever found time to read it!!)—and now I have a <hi rend="italic">nice </hi>note, apologising for <hi rend="italic">not </hi>earlier ansg., thanking for paper which greatly interested him, how he should like to have a chat with me (which he may still do), and that the printing should be done—in terms of my letter.</p>
         <p>And now you know all about it. I am writing to you, now, to ask, If you are <hi rend="italic">personally well </hi>acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">present </hi>Govt. Printer! I know you were with Didsbury. and I, also, by letter. <hi rend="underline italic">If you are</hi>, then you might see him about the matter (no hurry perhaps). I had written <hi rend="italic">fully </hi>to Didsbury, <hi rend="italic">long ago</hi>, about the work and again, in Ballance’s day, that all correspce., re proofs to &amp; fro, &amp;c, &amp;c, should pass <hi rend="italic">direct </hi>between <hi rend="italic">us two</hi>, which was also agreed to by Ballance then. Moreover, as <hi rend="italic">you have ptd. </hi>Bp. Wms.’ Dicty., (and had a full hand in Tregear’s Book) you are well-acquainted with the wants &amp; requirements of <hi rend="italic">such </hi>a publication. I know <hi rend="italic">nothing </hi>of the present Govt. Printer: no doubt you do—&amp; well.—Another item, is,—that in his sending me proofs, <hi rend="italic">the copy must come with them</hi>: this Hector (or some one!) would never do with his proofs to me of Papers, which often put me in a <hi rend="italic">fix</hi>.</p>
         <p>But, <hi rend="italic">if you are not on the best of terms with him—</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">Do not move in the matter at all</hi>.</p>
         <p>I must also know from him—how much per 100 (approximately) the whole cost would be, including binding, &amp;c—though this is <hi rend="italic">not </hi>of A1. importance, but the <hi rend="italic">no. of copies</hi> is.—–</p>
         <p>Further: as I suppose the Govt. Printer must have a heavy lot of work on hand, it may be, that he would not be able to commence it early—&amp; <hi rend="italic">this I should like to know, </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">in time</hi>, as I must be <hi rend="italic">here</hi> during its printing, and therefore would not go inland.—</p>
         <p>Possibly, my letters, &amp;c. to Didsbury <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the work, <hi rend="italic">may </hi>have been filed there in Govt. Ptg. Office?</p>
         <p rend="center">_____</p>
         <p>I shall write to you again ere long: but you have <hi rend="italic">no need </hi>to ansr. my scribbles as written: your time is much too valuable.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">8</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>. I close early this mg. for Mail. Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
