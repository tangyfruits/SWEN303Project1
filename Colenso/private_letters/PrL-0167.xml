         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Augt. 29, 1863</p>
         <p>Sir G. Grey, KCB</p>
         <p>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>Auckland.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir George</p>
         <p>At length I essay to fulfil my promise made to you at Wellington,—and send you now, by post, a few of the <hi rend="italic">earlier </hi>&amp; scarce publications in the N.Z. language—which I believe you had not in your Library of N.Z. literature at the Cape.—</p>
         <p>I should have done so before, only I have been delaying in hopes of some more turning up or out of my various old packages of Books, &amp;c. And still I think I may obtain others, and if so will also forward them.—</p>
         <p>I enclose a memorandum of the various publications, one or two of which, may, I think, interest you. You will see that I have added a Copy of that 8vo. N.Z. New Testament printed at Paihia. I have done this (although I believe you have a Copy in your Cape Library,) because this (a picked) copy was also bound at Paihia by myself with the intention of presenting it to our <hi rend="italic">first </hi>Governor, who, however, died before it was finished.—I have also added Copies of the first two publications in <hi rend="italic">English</hi>, printed in N.Z.—merely because of their being <hi rend="italic">the first.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir George,</p>
         <p>with every respect,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
