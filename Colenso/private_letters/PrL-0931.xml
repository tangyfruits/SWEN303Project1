         <p>Dear Hans Mortensen</p>
         <p>Your kind letter of yesterday I received this afternoon, and I thank you for it. I am pleased and thankful to <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> our Heavenly Father that you have so well escaped <hi rend="italic">two </hi>dangers—that of fire, &amp; that of the nail in your foot, this <hi rend="italic">last </hi>being a very dangerous thing, very often causing <hi rend="italic">death.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I write to you now, from your saying, that you were coming to Dannevirke this week, and would see me here; but I am going tomorrow to Woodville, and I do not know when I may return to this place, at the same time I may say I do not intend to remain long there. I go now to see the poor widow—Mrs. Jones, of course you know her well, also her late husband W. Jones, who, for many years, drove the coach by your place: poor fellow, he died suddenly on Friday morning, and only on the day before drove the coach to Eketahuna, and back to Woodville. I wired to his wife, on Saturday, saying, I would visit her, and her sorrowing family tomorrow, I would have gone then, but I had to take the Church Services here yesterday Mr. Robertshawe having gone to the Weber District; it will be a sad blow for them. Jones died, from a bursting of a blood vessel, inside, so that nothing could be done for him.</p>
         <p>I came here on Friday last in rain, and found it <hi rend="italic">very cold</hi>; there was snow on the hills. I am pleased in knowing from you, that you found my little books interesting.—I forgot to tell you, that the grass you showed me, in your garden, is <hi rend="italic">Timothy </hi>grass, and is said to be one of the best for cattle.—I cannot say, at <hi rend="italic">present</hi>, when I may again see you, much will depend on the weather. Glad to hear you are all well. Remember me very lovingly to your dear Father-in-law and to your wife, and to all friends, and give your own children a dozen extra kisses with my love. Good bye, dear Hans,</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
