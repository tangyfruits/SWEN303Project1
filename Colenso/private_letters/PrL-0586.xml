         <p rend="end">Napier, New Zealand,<lb/>December 29<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, 1884.</p>
         <p>B. Daydon Jackson, Esq.,<lb/>Secy., Linnean Society,<lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir </p>
         <p>I duly received by last month’s mail your very kind letter of 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. October, and I thank you much for it. Your letter has been before me on my writing-table ever since,—as a daily reminder,—not that I needed it, or had put off writing, for I have been busily engaged on a small Paper for you, containing descriptions of some new plants, and while I was engaged on it some more novelties from the Interior came in, and I have also been pleasingly at work on them,—and now my Paper is finished, and I shall send it, together with specimens of some of the plants described therein, in a registered packet addressed to you, by the S.F. Mail that takes this.</p>
         <p>I regret very much two things:—(1) I have not more specimens of two of the plants now sent (<hi rend="italic">Olearia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pimelea</hi>): these were lately brought to me from the mountainous interior, and I send you just all I have. You will,however, find plenty of specimens (in various stages) of my new <hi rend="italic">Hoheria</hi>, gathered by myself; and I should much like Sir J.D. Hooker to have some of these, as this genus is both small and endemic, and Sir Joseph Hooker has worked largely on it, and will be delighted at seeing a novelty; indeed, I purpose sending a lot of<hi rend="italic"> all</hi> sorts to him at Kew, on our return from our Highland woods, whither I intend proceeding next week;—when I also hope to write to you again. (2.) That I am utterly unable to make Drawings now! having quite lost the use of my thumb and forefinger, through severe overtasking my hand a few years ago in working at the “Maori” (or Polynesian) “Lexicon” for the Colonial Government. I write now with my 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi> &amp; 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi> fingers, and with thumb tucked closely into the palm: I can manage to do so pretty well at times,—though <hi rend="italic">long copying</hi> both strains and pains.—</p>
         <p>Such being the case, I am obliged to ask you, to get me the proper Drawings &amp; dissections made of (say) 3 of the plants now sent:—viz.,</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Hoheria sexstylosa,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Olearia multibracteolata</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Pimelia angulata</hi>:—</p>
         <p>that is, should your Council be pleased to approve of the publishing of my Paper, either whole or in part; the same to be done by some really good Botanical Draughtsman. Of course any amount of expense that may fall to me for so doing I will <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> and cheerfully pay: indeed, I would enclose a Draft to meet it, if I knew, or could nearly guess, the sum required.</p>
         <p>I should have greatly preferred (in addition to the <hi rend="italic">Hoheria </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Pimelia</hi>) some of the Orchids I have described being <hi rend="italic">drawn</hi>, &amp;c.; but the specimens of all of these are put up in spirits, (needful for that Family,) and I cannot well send them now. These will be sent to England in the Kew lot. The <hi rend="italic">Astelias</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Ourisia </hi>specimen, are also too large to be included in this packet.</p>
         <p>If my Paper should be published by you I should like t0o have a few copies of it, (“author’s copies,”) with plates, if any:—say, 20–30; for which of course I will also pay.</p>
         <p>A rather curious circumstance happened lately: which forcibly reminded me of my unfortunate error <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Sir J.E. Smith and your kind correction, and of my last letter to you. I had long been very desirous of obtaining a copoy of Sir W. Hooker’s “British Jungermanniæ”,—but, as often as I saw one mentioned in any London Catalogue, on my writing for it, it was either sold, or the price <hi rend="italic">raised</hi>! and then, of late years, its increasingly high price! However, I got a copy sent me recently from my Bookseller in London, and in it I find (securely fastened), a rather long and pleasing letter written from :Burlington House” by the late Mr. Kippist to Mr. F. Currey, dated, July, 1877, in which Mr. Kippist very kindly presents this book to him, saying:—</p>
         <p>—“You will not value the copy the less, that it was formerly the property of one (the Elder Yanson), to whose energy and liberal example the Society is mainly indebted for its present immunity from the heavy debt incurredin the purchase of the Linnean and Smithian Library and collections.” &amp;c., &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>In it Mr. Darwin’s name is also mentioned. The book itself is in excellent condition, &amp; contains their autographs. Little could any of those gentlemen have ever supposed, that this book would come to New Zealand!</p>
         <p>Should you find convenient time on receipt of this, I would thank you to reply: and in so doing please let me know, what would be about the charge for drawing plates of plants, including the necessary dissections,—much as those in your L. Society’s Serials.</p>
         <p>And, though so far off! and <hi rend="italic">knowing</hi> this cannot reach you till the middle of February, yet in writing at <hi rend="italic">this season</hi> I must heartily wish you a Happy New Year!——</p>
         <p>             Believe me, my Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>                             Yours very truly, Wm. Colenso.</p>
