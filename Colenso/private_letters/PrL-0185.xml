         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Feby. 25 1865</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>At length I dispatch my Ms. to you. I have labored hard to get it done to send by <hi rend="italic">this </hi>Steamer—and the Copying I have found a very heavy job: plain writing being most tedious to me, ever since I lost the use of my thumb (for writing) 2 years ago.—</p>
         <p>I fear you may find the Ms. too <hi rend="italic">long </hi>(may that be its <hi rend="italic">only</hi> fault!) but I question if it is much longer than the former. Of course you will deal as you please with it: I quite expect to hear of its being cut down—cut in, &amp; cut out. I only hope I shall have given <hi rend="italic">you</hi> satisfaction. If you should have time and patience to read it through, you will find (I think) a few novel &amp; strange matters. I wish I had had more time allowed to write it. I well know I shall not please <hi rend="italic">some</hi> folks: some, indeed, may please to call me un-orthodox!—but I have (I believe) <hi rend="italic">conscientiously </hi>written, <hi rend="italic">from experience only</hi>; and I am sure I have some knowledge of the subject.—While copying, I have often thought on Faust’s truthful saying (to Wagner)— “Who dares call the child by its true name? The few who have ever known any thing about it—who sillily enough, did not keep a guard over their full hearts—<hi rend="italic">who revealed what they had felt &amp; seen to the multitude</hi>,—these, time immemorial, have been crucified &amp; burned.” — —</p>
         <p>I have still the <hi rend="italic">Notes </hi>to write and send by next Steamer; also the Comp. Table of Dialects;—the Table of N. Island Natives, Tribes, &amp; Geographical position is <hi rend="italic">enclosed</hi>. I thought I would send this on at once, as, <hi rend="italic">if it should be deemed worthy</hi>, you can get on with the printing it. The Notes will make only a <hi rend="underline italic">few</hi> pages, and will (I think) prove interesting.</p>
         <p>If you should print the Essay in its entirety—or nearly so,—I should like to have a few extra Copies printed at my expence—say 50 (fifty).—</p>
         <p>I hope your Exhibition is doing pretty well. I have scarcely heard any thing of it since the opening. Am sorry to hear of more fires w. you:—&amp; now we have heard of <hi rend="italic">more </hi>serious ones at Auckland! In haste—</p>
         <p>Ever my dear Sir, yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
