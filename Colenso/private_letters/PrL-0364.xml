         <p rend="end">Napier, Septr. 3, 1878.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>This morning I received your kind long &amp; explanatory letter of 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Augt., and I thank you for it—<hi rend="italic">very much</hi>. All, that you have taken great pains to amass and bring forward therein, is (in the main) quite correct: what is yet <hi rend="italic">wanting</hi> (those infinitesimal quantities—always however so necessary in your favourite chemical analyses, to make up the 1000,) cannot be supplied by me without <hi rend="italic">much</hi> hunting-up and writing—which labour I shall spare both myself and you. One remark only will I make (as I see it <hi rend="italic">is needed</hi> to set yours right), viz.—that our Members for ’77 (69) and for ’78 (68) have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> all paid “<hi rend="underline italic">both</hi>” subscriptions—those for ’77 did for ’77 (69 x £1.1.0 = £72.9.0) and those for ’78 (68 x £1.1.0 = £71.8.0).—So much for <hi rend="italic">that</hi>. And now, as to the 5 vols. which we <hi rend="italic">want</hi>, (and must have from some quarter if to be obtained,)—as I said in my Official letter to Mr. Gore— “<hi rend="italic">I am prepared to pay for them</hi>.”  I think, I really must not write any more on this subject.</p>
         <p>But I have 4–5 other matters to write about: &amp; now, that you have so <hi rend="italic">kindly renewed our (old) correspondence</hi>, I will mention them.—</p>
         <p>1. Do you wish to have the papers which have been read here <hi rend="italic">sent in early</hi>? Such, of course, (some 3–4,) have long been ready.—</p>
         <p>2. If my Ms. should be printed, could not I correct the sheets?</p>
         <p>3. With one of my Papers there will be an illustration for a plate,—and should it prove to be a <hi rend="italic">sp. nov. </hi>(you will know), I am quite ready to pay for the lithogd. plate for our <hi rend="italic">next</hi> vol.—</p>
         <p>4. Is it <hi rend="italic">against</hi> any rule or bye-law of the N.Z.I., to read a Paper (which has been already read at a regular meeting of Members) at any <hi rend="italic">other</hi> meeting?—say, at the Athenæum, or at meetings in the Country.—A wish has been more than once expressed, to hear my “Ruahine Journey”,— “Traditions of Maoris”, &amp;c.,—so read, but I have refused.</p>
         <p>5. I hope to get out a short Paper on some Ferns (<hi rend="italic">sp. nov.</hi>) for our October meeting: would the <hi rend="italic">expense</hi> of a plate (dissections, &amp;c.) <hi rend="italic">be allowed</hi>?—and, Could <hi rend="italic">Mr. Buchanan </hi>do it? <hi rend="italic">If not, </hi>then could you recommend (or employ for me) and <hi rend="italic">decent</hi> draughtsman in Wellington?</p>
         <p>6. I have only just dipped into vol. x. (having been laid up for nearly a fortnight, &amp; only now getting round again,)—and I have been much interested in your <hi rend="italic">Marine Spider</hi>. I obtained one (in ’36 – ’37) from a similar locality on the islet (Motumaire) off Paihia, Bay Islands,—and I think (speaking from memory) it differs in size, &amp;c., from yours: I believe that I have it still (in spirits) &amp; if I can find it I will send it to you.—</p>
         <p>7. I am thinking over the getting out a complete &amp; fully illustrated work (both scientific &amp; popular) on our N.Z. Ferns (all species &amp; vars.),—<hi rend="italic">at my own expense</hi>: Would you aid me <hi rend="italic">heartily</hi> w. your influence, &amp; in getting me specimens?—(but this I should not commence until summer).</p>
         <p>8. I am considering seriously the resigning my onerous (&amp; unpleasant) office of Hony. Secy. H. B. P. Institute at close of this year. I fear, however, if I do so the Society <hi rend="italic">may collapse</hi>,—but I cannot help that. However, I won’t do so without again writing to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>: but what with carelessness <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and coldness <hi rend="italic">there</hi>,—it is more than I, at my age &amp; little ailments &amp; love of quiet, can well bear.—</p>
         <p>I may mention,—that in my writing to Mr. Locke <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi>, I said to him to <hi rend="italic">see you</hi> about those 5 vols. (L. being a member and one of our Council): of course, I did <hi rend="italic">not then </hi>know of this kind and full letter of yours, or I should not have written.—</p>
         <p>Hoping this may find you <hi rend="italic">quite </hi>well, &amp; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> overpressed w. work (so that I may get a reply) I am</p>
         <p>my dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. In looking over your letter again this morning, I find one other point I should notice—<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. You say, “My last printed report, in which were 68 names including the 5 new members for this year—was too late for this vol. (x) but will appear in the Inst. Report for this year”.—</p>
         <p>But, (1) we have <hi rend="italic">since then</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">six </hi>new members: (2) I got our <hi rend="italic">annl. </hi>meeting <hi rend="italic">altered </hi>last time from June to Jany. (so as to agree w. yours)—&amp; in Jany./79 it will be held—when the proper &amp; full List for ’78 will be sent to you:— WC.</p>
