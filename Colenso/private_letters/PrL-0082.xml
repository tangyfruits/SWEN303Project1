         <p rend="end">Wellington<lb/>Easter Sunday, 1849.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your very welcome letter of 24 July reached me duly in the summer, but from illness, household affliction, the ever press of business (and I may truly enough say lack of opportunity from my out-of-the-way Station), I have again procrastinated until the present, and now, being here only for a few hours, I write in a great hurry.</p>
         <p>Your letter contained much of <hi rend="italic">News</hi>—for, had I not received it I should have been somewhat uneasy at not hearing from, nor of, our Botanical friend. Up to the present I have neither heard from Sir William nor Dr. Jos. Hooker—If I except a note of Introduction which came from Sir William enclosed in a Letter from Dr. Harvey of <hi rend="italic">Fl. Capensis</hi>. I have however received the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>no. of the <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Antarca., </hi>so that now my sett is complete. Had Dr. Hooker commenced with N.Z. Plants—more, perhaps, than half of his <hi rend="italic">Flora Antarca., </hi>would have been there included.</p>
         <p>In spite of all my labours &amp; distractions, I managed to send them another case of specimens <hi rend="italic">since</hi> I last wrote to you; making the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> from these parts. I confess, had I known the Flora N.Z. would not have been commenced ere this, I should not have exerted myself as I did by night &amp; day—to get them off.</p>
         <p>I have had several applications both from Noble &amp; Scientific men for specimens—which I have been obliged to refuse to attend to, sorely against my will.</p>
         <p>I cannot attend to Reeve’s requests in any other way than my proposal which I made to him through Dr. J. Hooker—viz.–that I would send him specimens of <hi rend="italic">all </hi>my shells (perhaps amountg. to 200 species) for a sett of His Conchological works<note xml:id="ftn1-106" place="foot" n="106"> A proposal made in his letter to Kew of 6 August 1846.</note>—a fair exchange, and a finish.—</p>
         <p>Swainson lives in this neighbourhood, and is, I suppose, busy—as he keeps little or no company, &amp; lives retired: he has ample opportunity for doing a great deal.</p>
         <p>I suppose you have heard ere this from Dr. Hooker—any Information you can give respecting him will be always acceptable.—</p>
         <p>I have had during the past year, a great deal of writing to the Government—at <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of a very unpleasant nature. This consumed no small portion of time which might have been more profitably—or, at least, more pleasantly employed. Into that vortex I was drawn through some of my miserable countrymen, who were pleased to charge me with something akin to Treason! I scarcely need add, that I came off, as they say, “with Flying Colours”—much to their chagrin &amp; bitter disappointment.<note xml:id="ftn1-107" place="foot" n="107"> Colenso refers to the charge that he had dissuaded Wairarapa Māori from working on the roads.</note>
         </p>
         <p>I still hope to do somewhat for your “Journal”—but I must not again <hi rend="italic">promise</hi>.</p>
         <p>I am still in my uncomfortable quarters, with little prospect of a remove.</p>
         <p>Some of the Books (and perhaps Letters) sent from the Hookers have for certain been lost—as Dr. H. mentions particularly <hi rend="italic">Raoul’s Flora N.Z.</hi>, &amp; some other Frenchmen’s productions, which I have never seen. Any thing on N.Z. Botany, or the allied Flora’s (V.D.L. &amp; the Southern Islets,) interest me much.</p>
         <p>In my last case despatched, were some new Ferns, &amp; new Cryptogamic plants; little else of novelty, save some Algæ.</p>
         <p>This town has been all but completely shook to pieces with the numerous shocks of earthquakes which have lately occurred. The House in which I now am is completely ruined, and is deserted! but all this you must have read in the papers. It is a curious fact, that at Hawkes Bay (my station) where earthquakes were so common, we have not had a single shock, since the first which floored the Wellingtonians. The shocks still continue here at intervals.—a barbarous murder has very recently been committed in this neighbourhood—a quiet Settler &amp; his 3 little ones all murdered in the night: a Native is now in custody upon circumstantial evidence, and a special Commission has been called to try him. I am now going to visit him.</p>
         <p>I leave (D.V.) on my return Journey tomorrow, &amp; hope to reach my station by the middle of May.</p>
         <p>I am almost ashamed to send you such a uninteresting scratch—but, the thing is, this or none at this time.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>My dear Mr Gunn</p>
         <p>Always sincerely yours</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
