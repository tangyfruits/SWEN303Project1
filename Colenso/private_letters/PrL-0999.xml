         <p>Napier.<lb/>July 27, 1897 (night)</p>
         <p>Mr. H.G. Warren,<lb/>Tomoana.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have just received your note of this day, in which you inform me of your intended visit on Thursday or Friday next, with your friend from England.—</p>
         <p>Under <hi rend="underline italic">existing circumstances</hi>, I regret very much to have to say, that I shall scarcely be able to receive you—for <hi rend="italic">I am still </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">very weak</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> enter into any long or deep conversation. I returned on Friday last, noon, leisurely travelling by stages, but have not since been over my door step: and yesterday I told Dr. de Lisle, that I did not wish to see any one until I was stronger: and that I have even thought of putting an advertisement in our Papers—to request friends <hi rend="italic">not to call</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Moreover, pressing business (already too long delayed) will take me to town on Thursday morning next if <hi rend="underline italic">fine</hi>,—or, if <hi rend="italic">not </hi>fine on that day, then on Friday morning.</p>
         <p>Were it otherwise with me I should be most happy to see you and your friend.</p>
         <p>I am, Dear Sir,<lb/>  Yours faithy.,<lb/>  W. Colenso.</p>
