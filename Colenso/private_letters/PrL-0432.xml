         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have to thank you for kindly forwarding to me three copies of the N.Z. Grasses, 8vo., received some time ago; and now, yesterday, one copy of parts 5 &amp; 6 (in one) of the same work in the large size.</p>
         <p>I have been preparijng, since our Society’s meetings of last week, to write to you, and to Dr. Hector, which I now do by Mail tomorrow.—</p>
         <p>1. I would ask, For whom was that copy of Broun’s Coleoptera intended—which you so kindly sent me last month? For me, or for our Society?—Let your reply be what it may I shall want <hi rend="italic">two</hi> copies more of that work: which please send me early.—</p>
         <p>2. I also want a copy of the “<hi rend="italic">Appendix </hi>Official Catalogue N.Z. Court, Sydney Exhibition”; and, also, a copy of the N.Z. Court Exhibition <hi rend="italic">Melbourne </hi>Exhibn. Could you kindly send me these? Whatever the whole cost may be I will immediately remit it on knowing.—</p>
         <p>I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
