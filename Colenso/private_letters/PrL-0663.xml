         <p rend="end">Baddeley’s Hotel, </p>
         <p rend="end">Dannevirke,</p>
         <p rend="end">Feby. 28/88.</p>
         <p>Mr. D.P. Balfour, <lb/>Glenross.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Your kind friendly letter of the 26th is just to hand, and as I think the Mail <hi rend="italic">for</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">you</hi> leaves Napier tomorrow <hi rend="italic">afternoon</hi>, I write at once a few lines in reply, hoping I may be in time for our Mail—closing at 3. p.m.</p>
         <p>I am glad to hear you are all well, receiving visitors &amp; <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> but would that you had not had your unpleasant ducking—or ½–drowning on the Bullock Dray. I suppose the “Black Finmis” you mention is all right at Napier.</p>
         <p>You say—“no letter to answer”—Dare say, you are right, but it seems to me that I wrote to you in Jan—before I left N.—I have been <hi rend="italic">here</hi> just a month, &amp; I shall not return, yet! The truth is <hi rend="italic">I am better off here</hi> in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> domestic matters, than at Napier, &amp; enjoy <hi rend="italic">better</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">health.</hi> I have however prolonged my stay, owing to the <hi rend="italic">opening</hi> new Presbytn. church on Sunday last (26)—Rev. Mr. Paterson officiated, &amp; I attended both mg. &amp; evg. &amp; also “Sacred Concert” in it, last night,—when the good Scotch Diviner called on me to assist.—All 3 services <hi rend="italic">well</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">attended</hi>—&amp; a success.</p>
         <p>All that to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as a S-man.</p>
         <p>Weather fine here, some general rain, &amp;c. No annual meeting; yet called of our Society. (yet fixed by rules for lst My. in Feby.)—<hi rend="italic">Why</hi>? I don’t know. Fear there is a screw <hi rend="italic">loose</hi>!</p>
         <p>I have done <hi rend="italic">little</hi> in the way of <hi rend="italic">novelties</hi>—weather hot &amp; dry (even in woods &amp; burns) against me.</p>
         <p>In your letter, you say, “I expect you are now in the Bush”—Why then did you not <hi rend="italic">so</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">address it</hi>? &amp; save me 4 <hi rend="italic">bawbees</hi>?!!!</p>
         <p>The worst is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my N. friends &amp;c. do the <hi rend="italic">same thing</hi>!</p>
         <p>I hope this may find you all well. In haste for N/mail.</p>
         <p>Ever yrs. truly, </p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
