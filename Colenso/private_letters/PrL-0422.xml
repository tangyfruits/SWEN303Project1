         <p>Mr. R.C. Harding</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>We talked together so long this morning on the one subject, that I quite forgot to say, that I had a 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. part of Hooker’s “HandBook N.Z. Flora” in keeping for you, (having lately received some ordered copies of that work from England among our Institute Books,)—and now I have great pleasure in forwarding the same for your acceptance.</p>
         <p>I also send you a copy of <hi rend="italic">the sample sheet </hi>(!) of the Lexicon, (I regret its being so dirty, it had been trampled on at the P. Office,)—and, No. 18 “<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi>”—which you said you had not seen, as it contains (<hi rend="italic">in part only</hi>, being in Comee.) what Sir G. Grey and Mr. Ormond had said <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the said Lexicon.—</p>
         <p>Please return me this no. 18, as I have the set.</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
