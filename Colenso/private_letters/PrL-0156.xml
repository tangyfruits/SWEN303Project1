         <p rend="end">Friday night<lb/>June 27, 1862</p>
         <p>My dear Mr. McLean, </p>
         <p>As the Wh. Swan has not arrived, and as I leave <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> per Storm Bird for Wellington, and therefore may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> see you—I just write a few lines to inform you that I have received your note of 5th (<hi rend="italic">only yesterday</hi>)—and am sorry Dr. Knight has been disappointed. The little packet which has been missed, contained—a long letter from myself—and a French work on Lichens—Stictæ, by De Lise, with Atlas of Plates—which I had promised to lend Dr. Knight, &amp; which he had wished greatly to see—and I had long waited for a good opportunity.—</p>
         <p>Do not however think of it—such things will occur, &amp; do occur with us all.—</p>
         <p>Mr. Watt told me to day, he fully expected you by Steamer (Wh. Sw.) You will be a little surprised when you hear of our Civil Commissioner.—The town has been full of no other talk all the….</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">[page(s) missing]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I little thought poor old Waitangi would ever have been the means of so much talk among the Settlers.—</p>
         <p>—As I find you do not take in the H.B. <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> I have addressed one to you to go with this.—It is rather a curious coincidence to see the two Papers—pulling together in a public matter.</p>
         <p>—One thing I am very very sure of—that Sir George will find it a step in the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> to allow of any deed—<hi rend="italic">openly</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">fairly</hi> made, with the <hi rend="italic">full sanction</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">powers</hi>—to be called in question. As sure as ever the Waitangi Deed is so dealt with, so surely will the Natives apply to have other Deeds similarly dealt with. I am about to petition Sir George for Compensation, and I intend to accompany my petition (which will be drawn <hi rend="italic">very temperately</hi>) with a Letter, of few words, to be signed by the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Settlers and J.P.’s—say a dozen or so: and I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> ask you to sign it.—I shall send up to Wood, from Wellington.</p>
         <p>Before you quite leave us, I should like to have a note from you, stating, how you found the Natives of <hi rend="italic">this District</hi> on your first coming here—&amp; whether you (then) had reason to believe, that my exertions among them had been of an useful &amp; beneficial nature.</p>
         <p>I had arranged to go by Storm Bird, because she was advertised to sail on Tuesday 1st July and now she leaves 3 days earlier!!—I wished to see you.—</p>
         <p>The little sums of which I gave you a Memo. perhaps you will kindly place to my Credit at Bank of N.Z.</p>
         <p>Hoping to hear from you, </p>
         <p> Believe me,</p>
         <p> My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely, </p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso</p>
