         <p rend="end">Auckland,<lb/>Novr. 6. 1863.</p>
         <p>E. Catchpool, Esq.<lb/>&amp;c.  &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Dear Catchpool</p>
         <p>For the last week my conscience has been saying—to write to you—and now, within 2 hours of the Mail closing I essay to do so.</p>
         <p>The news by this Mail to H. Bay will astonish you:—<lb/>1. Domett My.<hi rend="italic">out</hi>, Fox My. <hi rend="italic">in.</hi>
            <lb/>2. Increase is ours!<lb/>3. Parliament is to close about 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.<lb/>4. Destructive whirlwind.­­—</p>
         <p>1. The D. My. although they were very strong in the House, &amp; had summoned us &amp; we were waiting for work—chose to squabble among themselves &amp; resign!! And lo! the Govr. accepted their signatures and immy. sent for <hi rend="italic">Fox</hi> who had only a few hours landed here! At first nothing was more clear than if F. made a My. of <hi rend="italic">his own </hi>party such would only last a day—he knew that, &amp; and made a Coalition Ministry (what I had fought for here 2 yrs. ago)—in which Whitaker is Premier, Fox leader in Ho. of Reps., Col. Secy. &amp; Nat. Minister, Wood Treasr., Russel, War Minister, &amp; Gillies Post. Mr. Genl., &amp; to reside in N. Island.—&amp; now, all opposition is merged in support, or at least quiescence. I think Domett has been trapped,—poor fellow! he has now no office &amp; not a penny! But there will be plenty of suitable offices under the new Laws &amp; policy which indeed D. sketched out &amp; inaugurated.—Last night we sat till X, &amp; passed 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. readg. of Confiscation Act, &amp; of a Yg. Court Martial or speedy prosecution Act for <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> treasonous matters—which was (of course) opposed by Dr. F., Mantell &amp; Fitzgerald—Division 26 to 10.</p>
         <p>2. Meremere is ours in the old nest but no egg nor birds! The scamps there were outflanked by the general on Saturday mg. last—who took in the dark 600 men in “Pioneer” beyond, &amp; placed them w. guns in position—intending on Sunday to show them his teeth—they in less than 24 hours paddled away very quietly, leaving however their 3 big guns (which they had brought from Ld. Worsley, &amp; from Raglan! fancy their toil!! the bitter regret!!!) also their horses (lots) and acres of potatoes nearly ripe. They took advantage also of the river being desperately flooded; &amp; so went in their canoes over low lands &amp; marshes where they could not by them be followed.—But they will be followed, &amp; <hi rend="italic">made</hi> to give in, &amp; <hi rend="italic">give up their arms</hi> (their land being <hi rend="italic">already gone</hi>) before peace can be made.—They are carrying on their <hi rend="italic">murdering</hi> of <hi rend="italic">boys</hi> &amp; poor peaceable settlers as before. (see Papers). But now too their town supplies (food) will be stopped—their boats &amp; canoes seized, &amp;c, &amp;c—the marvel is, such was not done earlier.—</p>
         <p>3. It is said, we are to be dismissed by 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>—I, howr., dont believe it.—possibly by “Ld. Ashley” <hi rend="italic">next</hi> mo.</p>
         <p>4. A whirlwind, tornado, or what you will occurred 2 days ago, within a few yards of where I am now writing this (on edge of water close to Wynyard place), which did much damage at Parnell—the W. end of Auckland, (as far off as your office from Fitzgerald’s old residence) smashing houses, &amp; breaking limbs of children &amp; carrying away wholly some buildings. All in 5 minutes, damage estimated at some thousands.</p>
         <p>I send you a Paper containing Fox’s speech, &amp;c. All our Militia are now away in the country, save the Reserves—and yet—this busy town is (or seems) <hi rend="italic">full</hi>!! but in the House—the Royal Hotel for instance the want of servants is felt—waiters, Cook, &amp;c., goes on My. duty, &amp; yesterday evening the landlord himself was ordered off! He refused to obey, saying 2 nights in the week must suffice, or he must shut shop.—</p>
         <p>And now about <hi rend="italic">your </hi>matters, in which I have not yet moved, waitng for your promised Letter from Tiffen but as he is now here, &amp; Fox moreover <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, I shall hope to do all I can for you:—if I don’t get that Letter from you by return of Rangatira, I shall immy. speak to Fitzherbert, &amp; go to work.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Between ourselves</hi>—I may tell you from what I have privately &amp; confidentially heard, P. B—ke will surely lose his office, unless he immediately reforms. I am really sorry for him, but I fear he <hi rend="italic">could not </hi>come up to what is required. In the event of the Govt. being determined to remove him—would you like to be again at the head of that Depart.—or would you like for M—ll to have it?—One of the Ministry complimented me for <hi rend="italic">not</hi> having signed the address to the P.M. General in favour of P.&amp; O.—this may tell you how the matter has been canvassed among them.</p>
         <p>Shand is here (who was at C. Islands) what doing I don’t know, but of all frights! I suppose his hair has never been cut since he left Wellington for the Islands.</p>
         <p>Almost every day rain, with sunshine—glorious weather for gardens, &amp; <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of vegetables, Brocoli &amp; new potatoes &amp; Cabbages, and all good things. </p>
         <p>I hope you are well and all things pretty comfortable about you. Whitmore returns today—ordered off (at which I think he is vexed)! Dr. F. brought Letters from Renata &amp; Karaitiana, &amp; made a speech as to their goodness loyalty &amp; truthfulness!! the Letters are against the present, as before against the last, Governor. Now had Dr. F. merely tabled them, seeing no other in the Ho. could speak to them, not knowing their contents, which he alone knew, the matter would end there: but I gave notice last evg., that I would take up the subject on Thursday next, meanwhile they are to be printed—so we shall have a fight.—Fitzgerald, yesterday said some foolish things, so did Mantell (he always does), &amp; Dr. F. about the poor ill-used Maori!!</p>
         <p>Wasn’t I astonished to hear of Lyndon’s move!!</p>
         <p>                     A Dieu: Believe me</p>
         <p>                             very truly yours</p>
         <p>                                                     W. Colenso</p>
