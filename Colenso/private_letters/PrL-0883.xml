         <p rend="end">Napier, Octr. 11<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. 1893.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>I duly recd. your friendly note of the 8<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.―and as it is just 3 weeks since my last to you—and I have contrived to satisfy my conscience (at this particular time) with my <hi rend="italic">top line</hi>, I will write you a short letter. I have <hi rend="italic">much </hi>I should like for <hi rend="italic">you </hi>to see &amp; read, &amp;c—had you <hi rend="italic">time to spare</hi>—which you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. I see you are very busy in office: <hi rend="italic">good</hi> but have you <hi rend="underline italic">any help</hi>? I <hi rend="italic">think </hi>you <hi rend="italic">should have</hi>—under <hi rend="italic">present affliction </hi>at home; or you will surely lay yourself up! &amp; <hi rend="italic">then</hi>—–? In a former letter I ventured to suggest your <hi rend="italic">brother </hi>to be with you, (possibly <hi rend="italic">not </hi>suitable?) and I don’t know what he is doing—or <hi rend="italic">where</hi>! I am distressed for poor little Victor, we all know—while there is life there is hope—espy. w. yg. children; but my dear friend, except V. speedily rallies, I believe that you &amp; Mrs. Hg. must prepare for parting with him. <hi rend="italic">May </hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps italic">God</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> help you</hi>—at this season, when Man can do so very little!—</p>
         <p>Yesty. I posted you a “Herald” that would give you a <hi rend="italic">notion re </hi>W.C. A fortnight ago I was offy. infd. by Hon. Secy. that he had no papers for last Meetg. &amp; looked to my promise: this was <hi rend="italic">confirmed </hi>by Hill (in town) last Wedy,—he then <hi rend="italic">leaving</hi> for the N. So I worked <hi rend="italic">hard </hi>to finish—got 2 / 3 p. ready, with several intg. spns. Left house at vii.30 retd. <hi rend="underline italic">weary</hi> at xi! was well recd. (spite of my cough!) &amp;, I think, for <hi rend="italic">once </hi>pleased my audience—but such an audience!! <hi rend="italic">not an officer of Instit., nor a single professional—nor a single </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">old</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> member! </hi>3–4 men (yg. Crerar yg. Newton, &amp; Craig) so Craig was made Chn. Now it was a remarke. time: the very day (both of wk. &amp; month) of Cook’s <hi rend="italic">big </hi>landing at H.B. &amp; taking possession: <hi rend="italic">and</hi>, by last Ml. a <hi rend="italic">long </hi>letter from Sir J. Hooker, detailing how he had <hi rend="italic">lately </hi>gained <hi rend="italic">Banks written Journal</hi>—<hi rend="italic">much </hi>more copious than anything in Cook’s voy., &amp;c &amp;c that it would make a 4to. of 400 pps. and he hoped to get a publisher &amp;c &amp;c. Very <hi rend="italic">interesting</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">so appropriate </hi>on this occasion. This wk. (spent here in sailing slowly round H.B., &amp; on Sunday 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. was the calamity at <hi rend="underline italic">C. Kidnappers</hi>. Audience mostly women; near close yg. McLeod came &amp; <hi rend="italic">read </hi>his <hi rend="italic">short </hi>p. (<hi rend="underline italic">wretchedly</hi>—as before)—&amp; Hony. Secy. gave a page or two of Taylor White’s—<hi rend="underline italic">quant. suff.</hi>—</p>
         <p>I returned in a <hi rend="italic">furious Sy. gale </hi>from Dvk. on 29<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. ult. (to keep promise with the Dean), all advised me <hi rend="italic">not </hi>to travel: Sy. 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>., 2 Services at Aug’s., &amp; now <hi rend="italic">there </hi>again on 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—&amp; I am keeping well.</p>
         <p>I wrote from Dvk. to the Bp.—telling him <hi rend="italic">my mind re </hi>his move—I <hi rend="underline italic">don’t approve of it</hi>: he came <hi rend="italic">here </hi>twice since &amp; we have <hi rend="italic">chatted </hi>over it, but <hi rend="italic">the die is cast</hi>! You will have seen by a Paper I sent you (30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. ult.) that he will not be leaving for 4 months—his single daughter goes w. him. <hi rend="italic">No one </hi>knew of it until he mentd. it in his address: &amp;, of course, <hi rend="italic">all surprised</hi>. He is now on the coast—Pourere—Akitio, thence inland to Wdv. <hi rend="italic">for 15</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>., &amp; then back to N., &amp; then away to the North. A nice form of P. is in use in our Chs., written by Bp., I shall enclose my copy: <hi rend="italic">keep it</hi>—use it, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> its meaning.</p>
         <p>Among other <hi rend="italic">curious </hi>letters to hand are 2 from Auckland: one from a Painter named <hi rend="italic">Steele</hi>, engd. on a <hi rend="italic">big </hi>historical painting “Sg. Try. Waitangi”,—and another from a person named Malcolm (formr. Schoolmaster at the Spit (he says) when I was Inspr.) on the same subject: they send me a clipping from a Paper, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>same (patrons Grey, Stout, Buller &amp;c) stating, “<hi rend="italic">assisted </hi>by <hi rend="underline italic">H.T. Kemp</hi>, who was <hi rend="italic">present</hi> at the Signing,” &amp;c &amp;c. In my ansr. I have <hi rend="italic">dared </hi>to <hi rend="italic">doubt </hi>this! <hi rend="italic">More anon</hi>, <hi rend="italic">no doubt</hi> (Eb. Baker’s fashion!!)—–Of course they want <hi rend="italic">aid</hi> from me: I have referred them to <hi rend="italic">pamphlet</hi>.—When yr. present heavy job is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>—I must ask you to read &amp; return Haast’s p., though there <hi rend="italic">may be time </hi>eno. w. <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> there. </hi>Kindest regards and best wishes.<hi rend="italic"> </hi>Ever yours truly—</p>
         <p>(Not seen Father since!!)                            W. Colenso.</p>
