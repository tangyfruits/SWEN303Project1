         <p rend="end">Napier, Sept. 19/76</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>On 13<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. I duly recd. yours of July 26<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., &amp; was pleased to find you were all then well: may this find you so. My last to you was on 26<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Augt.—which I hope you will receive, also the Papers &amp;c then sent. I have been laid up 8–9 days in bed, severe lumbago, &amp; only came down yesterday to sit up,—to you I try to scrawl my <hi rend="italic">first </hi>English letter; I am writing however in pain. I shall <hi rend="italic">endeavour</hi> to put you up a few Papers, (although to do so will try me <hi rend="italic">hard</hi>, as I cannot yet well get about the house, <hi rend="italic">or stoop</hi>!)—which will let you know a little of our H.B. doings.—I was <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> but pleased in finding your sons had lost your <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> mails Papers!! of the two, <hi rend="italic">I </hi>would rather that my letter to you—had been lost—<hi rend="italic">I feel </hi>I cannot write you a long letter this month.</p>
         <p>1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. of Business—and I suppose I must have told you that I was negociating w. Ingram for my Hampden Land,—well, that is <hi rend="italic">concluded</hi>,—₤625 he paying ₤125. leaving ₤500. @ 7%, and, of course, paying H.R.R. for ½ of divg. fence—which acct. (strange to say, as the fence has been perhaps 8–9 months) H.R. has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet sent in. I have also sold or let, w. a purchg. cl. ⅓ of the large Tn. Sn. <hi rend="italic">this </hi>side of Maori Club for ₤5. per. ft. frontage. Tuke came here one day in a dreadful hurry to see me about my selling <hi rend="italic">this Block</hi>, or a good part of it,—I offered 4 Sns. Subn. (39, 41, 42 with part of 40 and about 15 ac. @ ₤500 per ac.—Although T. was <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> by his employer he wanted <hi rend="italic">me </hi>to pay him. I (at last) sd. I wod. give him ₤50. <hi rend="italic">if he sold</hi>—but, in writing, I told him I wod. <hi rend="italic">not </hi>place it in his hands for sale:—a week after he told me in town (in passing), “strike off 2, &amp; it wod. be a bargain,”—meaning I supp., ₤300. pr. ac. I believe his employer was the Capitalist who put ₤10,000. in Bambury’s hands (see Papers). Tuke told me how Watt had <hi rend="italic">done</hi> Browning: W. <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi> the Subn. Sns. (48, 49?) &amp; he put Aitken to go &amp; offer ₤1000. for them; he did so. B. sd. they were worth more, but he must see his nephew, first; next day, A. saw him again; ₤2000. sd. B.; A. sd. he wod. take them; B. said he wod. <hi rend="italic">not</hi> pay the ₤100. commission, so A. gave the Chq. of W. for ₤2100.!!—no doubt they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> worth more. Watt is going to give ₤4000. to build a house thereon! I believe I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have sold <hi rend="italic">all</hi> this Block to Tuke including house,—but I could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> screw up my courage to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> high pitch! But had the Education Board finally concluded with me about the Inspectorship I might have agreed to <hi rend="italic">all</hi>. I enclose a note from Witty, wh. I have ansd., saying I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> your regular Agent, but I wod. mention it to you—pray direct me. <hi rend="italic">Great disturbances </hi>here between the 2 Clergymen (Townsend &amp; his <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Curate Robinson) <hi rend="sup ">7</hi>/<hi rend="sub">10</hi>ths. side with R. so T. is nowhere! <hi rend="italic">It is not yet ended</hi>. For the <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> pol. disturbances in the House of Reps.—you must see Papers.—I <hi rend="italic">have</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, thank <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> I was <hi rend="italic">not there</hi>. How little we know of the <hi rend="italic">future</hi>! Fannins younger sister Alice was married on Sunday (17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.) to a yg. surveyor from Xt.Ch.,—so much <hi rend="italic">off</hi> his hands. 3 days before his bror. Eustace went <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>, in F’s. house!! &amp; F. in tying him &amp;c. sprained his right thumb. E. was soon sent to asylum. P. Dolbel is at Wgn., w. his Petition, <hi rend="italic">re Carter’s mistake </hi>in letting the Mohaka Run. I drew it up for him—or, rather, <hi rend="italic">them</hi>,—himself, Balfour, not Fannin. Bee, are in it.—Well, I can say no more, &amp; have striven to do that. I am bettering; &amp; with kind regards, &amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>I am yours truly                     W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>(I see “you have been to <hi rend="italic">Walsall</hi>”: perhaps I had better tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, <hi rend="italic">privately</hi>, that I have <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> ceased writing to that place)</p>
         <p>22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. I close &amp; send you <hi rend="italic">10 packets </hi>of newspapers put up in pain &amp; with difficulty—I am a little <hi rend="italic">better</hi>!!</p>
