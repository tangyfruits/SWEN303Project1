         <p rend="end">Ho. of Representatives,<lb/>Wellington,<lb/>August 2/65</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>For some time past I have been expecting by every Mail to hear from you—as mentioned in your last (received) note,—or to receive “the <hi rend="italic">proofs</hi>” of the Essay.—Rather thoughtlessly perhaps on my part, as I have good reason to know you <hi rend="italic">are very busy.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I heard, yesterday, from Mr. Paterson, that you might be this way in a fortnight: when I shall be glad to see you.—</p>
         <p>I had hoped, that <hi rend="italic">the Maori Essay</hi> would have been printed by before this, and a <hi rend="italic">few </hi>copies (at least) in the hands of a <hi rend="underline italic">few</hi> of our Members—&amp; the <hi rend="italic">Ministry</hi>, &amp; the <hi rend="italic">Governor</hi>. Such <hi rend="italic">might have been</hi> of some little service, but ?—if not to stop their utopian theories respecting the race, at least to help me towards my being employed on the M. Lexicon.—Mantell, with (or, rather, <hi rend="italic">to</hi>) whom I have written very <hi rend="italic">much </hi>on the subject of the said Lexn.—&amp; who in his <hi rend="italic">last</hi> (6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ult.) agreed with me, &amp; promised “fully to confer &amp; settle when I should arrive in Wellgn.”—had resigned (!) before I came so I am again <hi rend="italic">at sea</hi> as to that &amp; getting disheartened.—</p>
         <p>*            *               *               *</p>
         <p>Our political horizon is rather “squally”; Bar. falling rapidly. Our (precious) “<hi rend="italic">reply</hi>” was battled over yesterday till 1 o’clock this mg.</p>
         <p>Remember me kindly to Mr. Mason who is <hi rend="italic">expected </hi>here: and if you are <hi rend="italic">not </hi>coming soon, &amp; could give him 1 doz. of the M. Essay <hi rend="underline italic">if finished</hi> for me, you would further oblige yours in haste</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>August 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Since </hi>writing this I have been asked by some of the leading members of the Govt.—as to the M. Essay—— W.C.</p>
