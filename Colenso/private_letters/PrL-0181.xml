         <p rend="end">Auckland<lb/>December 16/64</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Before this  can reach you—you will know of our School-House being closed. As I said in my last I have remd. behind to glean information for my 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. essay—at which I have been busy these last 3 days.—I leave by  next Steamer per<hi rend="italic">W. </hi>Coast—likely, the “Rangatira”, on 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>.—to reach (D.V.) Napier on Xmas. day.—</p>
         <p>I was with Sir George this mg. going over his garden &amp;c. and I am glad to find he intends visiting you, to open your Royal Exhibn.—</p>
         <p>I cannot learn from Mr Gillies—or any of your Bror. Commissrs. here—what is the <hi rend="italic">precise subject</hi> of the essay which Dr. Shortland was to write; and this throws me back a little; I know I have a <hi rend="italic">List</hi> of the essays at <hi rend="italic">Napier</hi> (though I have wholly failed to find one here) and I may learn therefrom which it was assigned to Dr.S.—I write however, now, to ask you in 2 lines (knowing how precious your time is,) to tell me what it was. As I hear that Mr Taylor has done some essay of that kind, (with which I hope you may be pleased, but I have grave doubts,)—I shall try hard to send you this essay by Feby. Mail: ever yrs. truly,</p>
         <p>                     Wm. Colenso.</p>
