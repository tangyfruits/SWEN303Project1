         <p rend="end">Mission Station, Waitangi near Cape<lb/>Kidnapper, Hawke’s Bay, June 18/46.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>1. Time has, indeed, rapidly flown since I last wrote you! Very often have I purposed to write, but, want of time and quietness, and of opportunity of sending from this desolate region, have combined to prevent me. I enclose a <hi rend="italic">portion</hi> of my Journal, which will serve, in some degree, to shew how it has been with me since I came here. I hope to send the remainder of my Journal (up to the present) as soon as I can find time to copy it. I cannot write to you quite so confidentially as I should wish; because, I must either send my Letters by Wellington (where I almost believe a Letter from me to you would be, at least, opened), or through the Missionaries residing on the Coast, who generally send their Letters (<hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>) to the Bishop’s College, or to Archd. <hi rend="italic">H</hi>. Williams.—Your kind note of May 31/45, I, at last (after several months of interval), received, and then, I may say, by <hi rend="italic">chance</hi>!</p>
         <p>2. I have heard, that your Comee. had negative to receiving of young men <hi rend="italic">here</hi> upon the foundation of the Society. This step, if you can persevere in it, and, at the same time, fill up the ranks, as they become vacant, <hi rend="italic">from England</hi>, with men of your own selecting, will be, I believe, one of the very best the Comee. could have adopted for the Religious welfare of the Natives. In a little while, however, you will have to guard (upon the same grounds) against Native candidates for the Ministry; because, what you at home would, in the very <hi rend="italic">first </hi>place require, would not, I fear, be so needed here.</p>
         <p>3. I have, also, heard of your Comee’s. determination <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>to adhere to their original Resolution respecting Salaries;—a Rule, which, (while it shews in the strongest light the kind paternal feeling of the Comee. towards their Servants, and encourages us anew to trust the Comee. in the fullest manner,) may yet, I think, be advantageously modified, so as not only to meet the majority of Cases, but to please (as far as may be) most parties. Now there are two classes of persons who may (I think) be fairly exempted from that Rule: the <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, those who have acquired a good amount of <hi rend="italic">present</hi>-available property in New Zealand, whether in Money, Cattle, Crops, or Land; the <hi rend="italic">other</hi>, those who have been, or may be, ordained or received in N.Z. since the arrival of the Bishop. By adopting the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, you would do much to stop the mouths of an angry public now every where opposed to us (and not, it may be, altogether without a reason) and, what is more, do justice to those few among your Servants who, while they have ever conscientiously kept themselves from “buying and selling and getting gain,” see, that some who have done so (and who, perhaps, do the least work) get almost double-wages. While, by adopting the <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, you will please the Bishop (who, in this matter, is, I think, right) &amp; save a few hundreds a year—and do no injustice to those persons who may fall under it—from their not being sent out by you, nor received upon any such understanding. Besides, (I speak with especial reference to those who have been received <hi rend="italic">here</hi>,) why should such persons have a larger Salary than those of the Propagation Society, who are in similar situations? and, it may be, ordained at the same time? Such tends (among other things) to cause and perpetuate a feeling of jealousy between them. In fact, my dear Sir, those who have been received here, ought, in strict justice, to have a much less salary than any other, from the fact <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>that it was <hi rend="italic">the</hi> settlement (at all times desirable, and doubly so in a strange land) that <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> followed the marrying of a Missionary’s daughter which was the main thing sought after, (as some have, witness enough, confessed). The Bishop mentioned to me, in a particular manner (and I have no doubt he has done so to your Comee.) the case of Mr. C.P. Davies,—a person who, humanly speaking, will never do much Missionary duty—who would never have been passed by Dr Whiting—and who was, spite of all the influence raised in his favor—kept back for 12 months by the Bishop, solely on account of his physical inability. Now Mr. D. has (at present) the same salary as myself, with less expenditure, less exposure, and very many more priviledges, and (according to present arrangements) should his family increase his salary would also! Among the persons who may be considered to fall pre-eminently under the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> class, are, Archd. H. Williams and Mr. C. Baker. Of the Archd. <hi rend="italic">I need </hi>say nothing to shew, (for common fame has already said too much,) that for many years he must have been a steady gainer to a large amount; and even in the late troubles, I think this equally clear, that whoever has been a loser <hi rend="italic">he </hi>has <hi rend="italic">not</hi>.—Of Mr. Baker, I would just note, that he has very valuable Land in Kororareka, which did not originally cost him £<hi rend="italic">10</hi>., and of which (while he lived in the Bay) he sold, to my knowledge, for the amount of upwards of £<hi rend="italic">1100</hi>; and now, that Kororareka is about to be rebuilt and repeopled, the value of his land there, (not to mention his valuable farms at Waikare and Kaipara) will be almost incalculable. Yet, while I am barely advocating the <hi rend="italic">equity</hi> of the principle which I have here laid down, two things should not altogether be lost sight of—the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>the saving to the funds of the Society; the <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, the saving of many of their servants from that insatiable lust of wealth, which, in a most peculiar and dreadful yet stealthy manner, grows with its growth,—enervates the whole man,—and eats out the very vitals of Religion.</p>
         <p>4. In a little while (as soon as I can find time to condense and make out the accounts) I shall have to appeal to your Comee. against the decisions of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> local Comee., respecting their allowance for this Station and District (of which I have not only already given them notice, but, also, of my intention to do so <hi rend="italic">through </hi>their hands). You, perhaps, will scarcely credit me, when I say, that the <hi rend="underline italic">only</hi> sum which this Comee. has been pleased to allow for my forming a new Station in this wild place (and that without any collateral aids from the C.M.S. Store as formerly, and which they enjoyed,) is £70!! Since which, they have refused to allow for Medicines; for Pencils &amp;c. for Schools and Teachers; for Travelling Expenses; and the heavy Discount which I (alone) have to pay at Wellington, upon their Bills drawn upon you. A reason which they assigned for not paying for Medicines and Travelling Expenses is, “there being no available fund”; when, on enquiry, I found, they had (following out your Resolution to the letter) paid themselves up all their arrears of past Salary, and thus settling <hi rend="italic">Private</hi> before <hi rend="italic">Public</hi> matters! But, anon. Had I that support I <hi rend="italic">need</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> </hi>I could now do much among these Natives in the way of Schools, &amp;c: all my own little overplus means (I may tell you) I freely use.</p>
         <p>5. I have mentioned Schools: I have introduced a simple plan among my Natives, (which I, also, worked upon at Paihia in 1836, 7, 8,) namely, to make out a School Book for every <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>village, in which is inserted the names of all the professing Xn. Natives, these are marked daily by the Teacher according to the attendance or non-attendance of the people, and, hitherto, they have succeeded admirably,—no one being desirous of having a bad mark put against his name. Two days ago, I closed for the time my Teacher’s School (another new thing of mine). I collected together nearly all the Native Teachers and Monitors of the District, 20 in number, (some having travelled about 200 miles to come hither,) and held School with them 8 hours daily during a fortnight. By this means I have advanced a step towards unity of Teaching and Doctrine. It would astonish you, my dear Sir, (it astonishes some of the old Missionaries when I have mentioned it to them, but the worst is, they wont believe it,) were I to relate the many and different erroneous opinions which the Natives hold. There is scarcely a heresy of ancient days which is not both held and taught by some one or other of the Baptized Natives. Yet, I am thankful to know, unconscious of its being wrong, and willing to cast it away on being taught the Truth. But, what is unconsciously received and inculcated by them now, will, by-and-bye, be pertinaciously defended, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> the evil which is now by some scarcely admitted to exist, will show itself rampant. Every year I trust (D.V.) to have a similar School;—but, here, too, I need support. It is a heavy expense for me to feed 30 or 40 Natives for some time, and then to give them each somewhat on departing—which I think they fairly deserve. The Comee. <hi rend="italic">here</hi> will, I know, oppose it: because, some of them may not see the utility of it; others may (say, they) have no time to do the same; others again may not have the requisite ability, from ignorance of the past times of the Church, or ignorance of the Native language; while others may object to it from want of inclination—no great need to teach <hi rend="italic">Natives</hi> such high things—or, (such perversion I have <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>heard)— “God knoweth them that are his, and will take care of his own”! <hi rend="italic">Iam satis</hi>!—</p>
         <p>6. And now that I have touched upon the subject of Schools, allow me, my dear Sir, to request you to procure me the following donation:—2 or 3 ream of writing paper; 1 ream of ruled paper, 5 lines to the inch, for teacher’s books; ½ ream imperial Brown; 5 quires of blotting; 3 or 4 gross of <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> lead pencils; 1000 quills; a little Indn. Rubber in small pieces; ½ gross of strong pen-knives; a Sett of Maps on a large Scale, comprising, The World (Mercator’s Projn.), Europe, Asia, Africa, America &amp; Polynesia, &amp; Palestine; a Sett of ditto ditto, <hi rend="italic">outlined without names </hi>to be filled up here; 1000 Slates; Slate Pencils; writing Ink, &amp;c, &amp;c. If you can possibly procure me these articles you will indeed confer a favour upon us all. Now if I am not allowed &amp; encouraged to <hi rend="italic">feed </hi>the Native mind, and to <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> it on a little in its thirst after novelty, (although I believe in no case will it ever make any great advance,) I shall do not a little towards keeping the Turbulent Native Tribes about me in peace. But this must not be fettered down by rigid rules, &amp; Inspection, &amp; overseeing, for the Native mind will not at present bear it. The way to lead <hi rend="italic">this rising generation</hi> on, is, to take them somewhat in their own erratic way; <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> Schools must be left for those who come after, who will have <hi rend="italic">finer</hi> materials to work upon. For, notwithstanding all the beautiful theories which are afloat, I, feel bold to say,—we must be content to use the Coarse Seive; that is, if we really wish to benefit the mass of the people. Hence, in my opinion, the Bishop’s Schools for Natives, wherever established, will ultimately fail; because they are not suited to the wants and habits of the people; they attend for a time it is true—indeed, considering all things, they hold out wonderfully <hi rend="bold">[7]</hi>—but, <hi rend="italic">I see</hi>, plainly enough, that it is to him an infliction.—Hence the reaction. They return to their Native liberty with much the same feelings as a bird has which escapes from a cage, or a white mouse from the revolving-box of an Italian toy. I have often asked the question, could our Schools of the present day have succeeded in the times of Boadicea, or Egbert? I have (from my arriving in N. Zealand) always encouraged Letter-writing among the Natives—often sitting up late to answer their numerous Letters—some of my brethren, I know, have <hi rend="italic">smiled</hi> at the thing, but, I have reason to believe, that a Letter is likely to do more good—<hi rend="italic">to cause more thought</hi>—than a ½ doz. Sermons;—such being read <hi rend="italic">to </hi>all, and <hi rend="italic">by</hi> all who can read, over and over again. I have now by me more that a 1000 Letters from N.Zr’s., some of which (from my older Correspondents) exhibit the working of the Native mind.—Shortly after I came here I received a Letter from the Teacher of Wairarapa, containing a long list of different texts which he wished to know the meaning of; pressed, as I then was for time, I answered his Letter, which, though I condensed as much as I could, took about 12 pages; to my great astonishment I found, on visiting those parts, that several Copies of my answer had been made by the Natives.</p>
         <p>7. And if, my dear Sir, you could also send me (I can not afford to purchase just now), a good Copy of the Septuagint; ditto of Josephus (<hi rend="italic">Eng</hi>.); and a Greek Concordance to the N. Test., <hi rend="italic">Glasgow</hi> Ed.,—you would still add to the obligation.—</p>
         <p>8. The Press, &amp;c., has just come safely to hand; but, judge of my disappointment when I found that Watts (as once before) had sent me b’s and v’s for h’s and n’s!—so that, for utility, the Press might just as well be at Cape Horn, as here at Cape Kidnapper! I am now obliged to write out many prayers, &amp;c., for the Natives—which is <hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>very onerous. It has been said,— “Why write out prayers at all? why bind to a dead form? why cramp the spirit? (!) They know how to pray.” This latter, I, however, in general <hi rend="italic">deny</hi>. Oh! I have heard of horrid things said unwittingly by them in prayer, aye, by their Teachers too. Many, I doubt not, of the Natives of this District have received Baptism with just as much thought about it, as Cattle have which are driven up to be branded! Start not, my dear Sir,—time will shew:— “Tell it, however, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in Gath, lest the uncircumcised triumph.” Here, I may remark,—The Natives, for many years, have been in the habit of holding Prayer-Meetings on 2 evenings in the week—<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Wednesdays &amp; Saturdays. For some time past (2 or 3 years) there has been a negative attempt (so to speak) on the part of several to put them down: <hi rend="italic">why</hi>, you must guess. Some time ago, I was not a little amused (<hi rend="italic">rather grieved</hi>), to hear one of our Archdns. say,— “One reason I have for being against them, is, everyone prays, and the prayers which are offered are such poor things,”—and this, after 10 years (at least) experience!!—(how soon an excuse is found). I, however, venture to uphold them, but, in this way:—I select from among the Baptized Natives 4 or 6 persons only for that office, who stand for 6 months, when I select again; and, moreover, compose Prayers for them to offer.</p>
         <p>9. During the period of my residence here, I have, in visiting the Natives, been thrice to Wellington—by way of the sinuous &amp; rocky coast, a most desolate and heart-dispiriting route of 240 miles!—and have mourned again and again over the sad spirit exhibited by many of the Settlers (especially the N.Z. Company’s folk) towards the Natives. A truly Nero-like spirit, which, if fostered, must inevitably end in either the destruction of the Native, or the disappearing of the N.Z. Race. My Journal, by-and-bye, will shew a <hi rend="underline italic">little</hi> of what I have been called to endure from my own Countrymen. When last <hi rend="bold">[9] </hi>on, in March in the very midst of their troubles—I found not only the whole locality placed under “Martial Law,” but, nearly one-half of this District! Extending, by Proclamation, to “Castle Point”—over a Country where I had been peaceably employed during the preceding fortnight in Teaching, Baptizing and Marrying, without ever dreaming of such a thing!—and where the Natives (even on to Parangarahu, a village only 2 miles from the S.E. head of P. Nicholson,) were quietly attending to the ingathering of their Wheat and other Crops;—80 bush. of wheat I found threshed out of Parangahau alone, and, even <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, all hands quietly at work. On arriving at Wellington I found, that 2 Natives had been apprehended on the serious charges of burglary, &amp;c., and placed in close custody on board of the War Steamer. I heard of their intention to destroy themselves, through fear, and I sent them word not to do so. In a few days they were examined, (or, rather, the whites who came forward against them,) when <hi rend="underline italic">six</hi> white men swore in the most positive manner to the identity of their persons—of course, they were Committed for trial; and, the Supreme Court only closing the week before, these 2 Natives would necessarily have to wait nearly six months, immured in a gaol during the whole winter, before they could be tried. Two days after, on returning to Pitoone, (a village at the mouth of the Heretaunga R., and about 6 miles from the Town,) I found the whole Ngatiawa Tribe loud in their expressions against (what they called) the injustice of the <hi rend="italic">Pakeha</hi>. I enquired of the Xn. Teachers—there are 2 good ones here, &amp; some very nice Natives—I found, that the barest <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi> that can possibly be conceived could be most easily proved upon the united and clear statement of no less than 15, or more, unexceptionable Native Witnesses. The reasons why they did not come forward to clear their friends, were,—1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. Fear, Martial Law; no body of Natives being allowed to enter the Town—2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Not being called upon by the (so-called) Protector—3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. “The alibi” (as the old Chief said) “being so very <hi rend="italic">clear</hi>, as <hi rend="bold">[10] </hi>not to need 2 words before Natives, much less before Whites, who boast of their superior discernment of Justice.” My time, however, was expired I considered; I wrote and sent the whole case to Rev. O. Hadfield and Mr. St. Hill (the P. Magistrate who had committed them,)—venturing to recommend their speedy trial, inasmuch as they were apprehended during the time of Martial Law,—and now Mr. Hadfield shall relate the sequel—in a Letter I received from him only 6 days ago:— “On receiving your Letter from Pitoone, I spoke to the Governor about the 2 Natives, and he, after making some enquiries, issued a special Commission for their trial, and appointed a Counsel to defend them. William was acquitted, but Kumete” (unbaptized) “was found guilty, and sentenced to 10 years transportation. I was fully convinced that he was innocent; and consequently having acquired some new facts, I wrote to the Govern. upon the subject: he came to me and said, that if anything could be brought before him in an official way, which was not adduced at the trial, he would take cognizance of it. Mr. St. Hill worked hard in pulling together some very strong evidence, and then both he and I each wrote a strong official Letter to the Governor. The facts, &amp;c., were laid vefore the Judge, and, upon his recommendation, Kumete was discharged.”—</p>
         <p>10. There are several Settlers located here and there in the extensive valley of Wairarapa (Palliser Bay), these have mostly taken leases of land from the Natives, at a trifling yearly rent, varying from £8. to 12£. Now this plan, when fairly managed, is one of the very best that can be devised. For, it is equitable—by it the Native has something to look forward to—and, as a necessary consequence, protects his Tenant. But here, as in every place where it can be done, the simple Native has been over reached, for these Settlers have taken pieces of good level land varying from 4 to (I believe) 10 miles, or more, in extent, and that, upon leases extending from 30 to 60 years! at the paltry annual <hi rend="bold">[11] </hi>sum of £10—which leases (of course!) include “<hi rend="italic">all below</hi>” the surface—and which Ten Pounds has (perhaps) to be divided among from 10 to 40 persons. One Settler told me, that during some weeks of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> year of his residence in the valley, he had made 150lbs. of butter a week, for all which (&amp; more too) there was always a ready Sale at a good price at Wellington.—Beef, Mutton, and Cheese, moreover, find a ready sale at a good price at W.,—8d, 10d, per lb. for the 2 former, and 1/- to 1/2d for the latter. <hi rend="italic">Now </hi>the Natives, in some places, are beginning to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> that they have been again duped; hence they become discontented, and eventuially refuse to stand to their agreements. Upon which they are not only abused, but their Religion, and (above all) the Missionary, who is sure to come in for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> share. Again, the respectable Settlers at Wairarapa not only told me, that they were living in peace with the Natives, and never wished the plan of leasing Land from them to be interfered with, but, also, that they dreaded its getting into the hands of the N.Z. L. Company, who (by their Agents) had already tried again &amp; again, to purchase the whole valley from the Natives, over their respective leases. How easy it would be, for the Governt. to allow and encourage such Leases; and, by laying a tax upon them, curtail their size, raise a revenue, and protect the Native! I was very sorry, indeed, to see, while at Wellington, a proclamation issued, waiving the Crown’s right of pre-emption over all Lands which might be purchased by the N.Z. Land Company, and in “their favour alone, without any regard to any other class or party of persons whatever”! The Newspaper which is published at Wellington, (by a Mr. Stokes, who was, I believe, a Surveyor under the Compy.,) should never be depended upon for any thing more especially any thing in connexion with the Natives &amp; Governt.—I merely mention this, that you may not, at any time, be led astray through any misrepresentations.——<hi rend="bold">[12]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>11. A sterling strong-minded Missionary, not over-sensitive, is much wanted for Wairarapa and Wellington. Those Natives who reside there are very much exposed, and I, at this end, with 2° of <hi rend="italic">lat</hi>. between us, can do but little for them. The sooner you could place one there the better—even in a political point of view—for now they have no <hi rend="italic">Matua</hi> (Father, Director, one to whom they can look for advice,) and, in too many cases, every man does what is right in his own eyes. I think your Comee. ought not to allow of a Missionary being placed at any old Station where there is another Missionary, <hi rend="italic">merely because that person is an Archdn. </hi>To me, such appears to be utterly at variance with the very foundation of a <hi rend="italic">Mission to the Heathen</hi>. If the Bp. chooses to place one of his young men under an Archdn., so much the better, in such a case the young man will, doubtless, be a gainer;—but, I think, your Missionaries should be dispensed abroad according to the present <hi rend="italic">wants of the Natives.</hi> I just touch upon this, because I have heard, that in Case of your sending out any Missionary (which, it is expected, you will shortly do,) one is to be placed at Turanga with Archdn. W.W. Wairarapa and Wellington I would more especially recommend to your particular consideration.</p>
         <p>12. The Natives, in several places, are in a very unsettled state; which is no more than might be expected. More particularly (just now) the Ngatirangaratahi, Ngatiraukawa, and Ngatimaniapoto Tribes, from Porirua, Otaki, and other places up the Western Coast, and near to Wellington. They have murdered 2 whites in the Heretaunga valley, and surprised the Military &amp; killed 8, without a single Native being wounded! This has made them presumptuous; and now, the whites, rising in arms against them, and fearing their strength, have got these Ngatiawa (a nice Christian <hi rend="bold">[13] </hi>Tribe) to join them; which will, I fear, ultimately prove to have been a bad step, and one which may involve the whole S. in war.—For Rauparaha would, I believe, remain quiet, had the Ngatiawa (his old enemies) not risen and become co-operators with the <hi rend="italic">Pakeha</hi>. The Troops are again sent for; and what the event will be, no one knows. But, in order that you may have a better understanding of the matter, I should tell you, that when in March last, the Natives were ordered off the grounds on which they were dwelling in the valley of Heretaunga by the Governor, they would not leave until the Military were ordered to advance; the Settlers <hi rend="italic">then</hi> rashly interfered—(I enter not into the <hi rend="italic">prior </hi>matter, of the Settlers having been long kept out of their purchased allotments <hi rend="italic">by</hi>, and of the great annoyances they had been continually receiving <hi rend="italic">from</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> </hi>the Natives, which may be, in the main, correct,)—and, seeing that the Natives (about 60 in number) had left their villages, tore up some of their crops, (then ripe,) speared and seized their pigs, and burnt up their houses, canoes, &amp; Chapel. This is the great sore.—Had the Military done it, the Case would have been different. Yet, not a word of this is to be found in the Newspapers of the day!—I had my information not merely from several Xn. Natives who lived close by, but from a highly respectable Settler residing in the valley, who also told me how sorry he was that they had so precipitately acted. Hence arose the plundering of the out-settlers on the Sunday following—hence the murders which have since taken place—and, hence, this more than prospect of intensive War. Further; on the Governor’s message being conveyed to the Natives residing in the valley, to leave quietly, a small party under Taringakuri readily obeyed and came directly to Wellington; yet, Tarangakuri’s Canoes and Houses shared the same fate.—On which the Chief said, “I <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> the word of a Governor was sacred, but <hi rend="italic">now </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">I see</hi> that he too is nothing in the eyes of his own people”! And, when the Governr. went round in the War Steamer to Porirua, (taking the Military with <hi rend="bold">[14] </hi>him,) in order to see the Chiefs, (Rauparaha and Rangihaeata), and to establish a peace, some of the whites of Wellington (I should hope of <hi rend="italic">only </hi>the <hi rend="italic">canaille</hi>,) told the Natives, with many significant gestures and signs, “Ah! soon will Rauparaha &amp; Rangihaeata be hung up by the neck for the massacre (!) at Wairau!”—what was the consequence? why, long before the steamer got to an anchor, Native expresses on horseback had arrived at Porirua from Wellington, bringing the news (the atrocious falsities) which they had heard.—Of course the Governor’s visit was worse that useless; all his endeavours to see the Chiefs were only mocked at. The foregoing statement—as far as concerns the information given to the Natives—I had from Dr. Fitzgerald (a warm-hearted friend to the Natives though a Romanist) <hi rend="italic">while</hi> the Governor was absent at Porirua, who had been told it again &amp; again by the Natives; and the result proved its correctness.—</p>
         <p>13. I understand that the present Protectorate staff are about to be abolished, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> only Protector to be retained. Mr Clarke has resigned the office, deeming the Salary too small. The Sub-protectors are, I believe, of little worth. Nor will any person <hi rend="italic">paid by the Government</hi> ever do for that office. A Protector should be appointed by some Philanthropic Society in England; he should be a man of strong mind and body, <hi rend="italic">devoted to the Native’s Cause, utterly careless of making a fortune for himself</hi>, and, if possible, a <hi rend="italic">sincere </hi>Xn. I place <hi rend="italic">this last</hi>, believing the other requirements in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> situation to be most needed.</p>
         <p>14. I can but think, that this yearly meeting of the Syndicate at Auckland—there to remain during the whole winter—ought not to take place in these unsettled times. True, a revision of the Scriptures and Prayer Book is needed, but the <hi rend="bold">[15] </hi>Natives are not now in that state to be left long without their guides. I believe that Archd. Williams will take <hi rend="italic">the whole of his family </hi>with him when he goes—which will be I suppose in a few days.</p>
         <p>15. The Bishop was here in January, and remained 8 days, examining Natives for Confirmation. At this Station his Lordship confirmed 130, and, in the District, 244. He only confirmed 44 at Te Kopi, where there are nearly 150 Baptized <hi rend="italic">Adults</hi>! the most of whom were Baptized by Mr. Cole without (it is said) any examination on his part!!—Several of them have apostasized. Last month, the Archdeacon came here from his Station, and administered the Lord’s Supper to 130 Commts. But those Baptized Natives who are scattered here and there in the various villages throughout this immense Parish, can only partake of the Communion once a year <hi rend="italic">at most</hi>, (i.e. when the Archdeacon, according to the Bishop’s wish, goes his annual round,) and then (in consequence of his time being so valuable as not to allow of his making any stay) without preparation; and, in some places, on week-days, which the Natives very much dislike.—Now all this tends, <hi rend="italic">among this people</hi>, to lower in their eyes the resident Missionary, which is just the very opposite of what should be done. Again, with regard to the Baptism of Adults,—a Canon has been set forth, committing this to the especial charge of the Archdeacon, which Canon is, moreover, not to be interpreted according to (what I call) its literal meaning, but according to a something which is only known to those who are in possession of it. When the Bp. was here, we freely conversed together; I seized the opportunity and cleared my own conscience; pointing out many things which I had seen at Waimate and elsewhere, and had heard talked of among the Natives. He took <hi rend="bold">[16] </hi>all I said, very well, thanking me for it. On Whitsunday last, I Baptized 26 adults here, with whom I had taken much extra labour; which alone has given the old Baptized Natives of this neighbourhood better views of their ordinance than they ever had before. Since I came into this District I have Baptized 106 adults and 95 children; with every one of the former I had much searching examination, and felt satisfied that they had, at least, a good head knowledge of the way of Salvation; I have also married 35 Couple. On my coming here I found there were 5 half finished chapels throughout the District; there are now eleven finished, &amp; 7 in course of erecting. In almost every village I have a daily adult-school, which is well attended. And, I have, at present, about 200 candidates for Baptism. I have plenty of Enemies, (<hi rend="italic">vide</hi>, Journal,) and have been ill, but I am again pretty strong, and hope to work a little longer for the glory of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> in pointing poor sinners to Christ. The Natives of the Manawatu District wish very much to belong to this parish; they are at present said to be under Mr. Govett—though they say, and seem to belong to “Noman’sland.”—I have been obliged, at last, to lay the matter before the Bishop. They have much to say in favor of such being permitted, and, I think, rightly too; they have seen the Archdn. upon the subject, and I think the Bp. will consent to it. This will add a little more to my work. There are a few (about 10 or so) Papists in Wairarapa, to whom, shortly after my arrival, I addressed a Letter. They shewed it to their Priest (who happened to be there just after my Letter had reached them), who said I was mad and took possession of it. Subsequently, when the Bp. was at Wellington, the Priest sent it to him, with his own observations upon it. The Bp., when here, told me, he found no fault with my Letter, but that he did not approve of the printed Scriptures (which he <hi rend="bold">[17] </hi>had enclosed) being headed “mot e pikopo,”—(i.e. for the Papist,) I enclose a copy. It passed off, however, very well, and I have since (spite of the Priest’s efforts) gained one of his proselytes,—and hope, yet, to gain them all.</p>
         <p>16. I doubt not but you will find several little blunders in my Journal—for I have not had time to read it over since copying. Should such be the case, be lenient towards them. If, my dear Sir, you can find time to write me, do so <hi rend="italic">by post</hi>, to the care of Rev. R. Cole, Wellington, (who is a warm friend, and always on the <hi rend="italic">qui vive</hi>,)—but do not use any seal by which you may be known: as, I believe, I am on every side a marked person.</p>
         <p>17. I have heard a report of Mr. Busby’s safe and prosperous return to the Bay of Islands; which, I hope, is correct.—We rarely get any News here until it is very old. This place is quite out of the way; low, damp, cold, and unhealthy, surrounded with morasses, and having Snow upon the mountains and hills during several months of the year. The Bishop said, he thought it was the most disagreeably situated Miss. Station of all in N. Zealand! In fact, there is nothing whatever to recommend it. No water—no wood—no good harbor—no shelter from stormy winds, not having a hill or tree or bush <hi rend="italic">near </hi>us—no female domestics to be had from among the Natives—and, worse than all, no good well-disposed Natives. All my stores, cases from England, &amp;c., have always come to hand more or less wet and rotten; and my loss (on Flour, Clothes, and Books,) has been great. Mrs. Colenso has given birth to another Child, whom I have named, Ridley Latimer, for, living as I do in these truckling times, in which, some <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> change their opinion, or lay it aside on the shelf,—and others, <hi rend="bold">[18] </hi>who hold the truth, are afraid to speak out,—I have concluded, not only to shew my Colours (as I have always done), but to let it be seen that they are <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> to the mast.—</p>
         <p>We are all pretty well—but not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> well. There is too much to be done, and too many “stirs” continually about us, for any one but a stone to enjoy good health. Our hope, however, is in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>, who daily enables us for all things; thus we prove the blessed Continuance of the promise— “As thy day thy strength.” If I were now to choose an armorial bearing, I think it should be, a burning yet unconsumed bush.—</p>
         <p>Remember us, my dear Sir, in your prayers;—charitably construe whatever I may have <hi rend="italic">unintentionally</hi> written amiss in this long &amp; rambling Letter;—and believe me, with sincere affection,</p>
         <p>your most obedient Servant,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p>June 22, 46.</p>
         <p>By a Letter just received—I have heard of the death of Te Heuheu (the great Chief of Taupo) with 50 men with him, on Whitsunday—while we, here were engd. in Service, &amp; in Baptizing,—occasioned by the sudden sinking of the hills of Taupo—? earthquake, or occasioned thereby. I write in haste.                        W.C.</p>
         <p>P.S. There is yet a little matter I had all but forgotten:—I have seen the Record Newspaper, in the C.M.S. Record, and Ann. Report—a long but <hi rend="italic">colored</hi> statement (written by Mr C.P. Davies) concerning an affray which took place at the Waimate. I was residing at the Waimate at the time, and well recollect how Mr. D. got “roasted” at table by the Missionaries &amp; students present for his manner of relating the story, on the very day in which the affair happened. Since the Papers and Publications have come to this Land, which continue the same, there has been no small amount of ridicule made upon it. I do not, I dare not, say, Mr. D. wrote any thing that was false;—but all newcomers are very apt—first, to misconceive, then to misunderstand, and then, with the aid of a warm imagination, to embellish most enormously! (<hi rend="italic">Parturient montes</hi>!) I have known this to be done more than once, and I have also known the Socy. to suffer by it.</p>
         <p>P.S. 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>.—June 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>.—Since writing the foregoing I have received a Letter from the Native Teacher at Pitoone, in which he says,— “Very great perhaps will be the evil of the people of this neighbourhood: this fighting is evil, but the people follow after it. With the Govr. is the direction for us. O friend! Listen,—In fine weather the Tamakihi (<hi rend="italic">Cicada</hi>) sings, in dull weather the Tarakihi is silent.”—As much as to say, this evil day of war will upset all our prayers, Schools, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>A Dieu, my dear Sir,</p>
         <p>W.C.</p>
         <p>An extract:— “James naturally concluded, that men (among the clergy) who expected preferment from his favour would be willing to merit it by promoting his designs.”</p>
