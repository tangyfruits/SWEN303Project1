         <p rend="end">Napier, 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. July, 1887.</p>
         <p>E. Bibby, Esq<lb/>Waipawa.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I feel very much obliged to you for your kind note of 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. instant, and also for all the trouble you have so readily taken in that matter of Rates. Had Mr. Tuely, in his note, explained (however briefly) what they were for, &amp; the time, &amp;c.,—or had he replied to my note in which I had made enquiry, I should not have troubled you: I thank you, dear Sir, most heartily.—–</p>
         <p>I am now writing to Mr. Johnson (<hi rend="italic">re </hi>rent, ½ year due on 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. inst.) and have mentioned the Rates—“6/3.” saying,—If for 188<hi rend="italic">6</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">unpaid</hi> by me, then I will pay them.—–</p>
         <p>Mr. Johnson spoke to me here in town in the <hi rend="italic">early </hi>summer (soon after my visit to Waipawa) I think in Octr., or Novr.—not later: and an agreement was <hi rend="italic">then made</hi>; but, somehow, the lease was not drawn, or executed, for some time, and so the date of Jan. 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>./87, &amp;c., was filled in:—but it will be all right—I suppose.—</p>
         <p>I really <hi rend="italic">regret </hi>my being <hi rend="italic">no longer </hi>a voter among you! not that I ever exercised that right,—still, such <hi rend="italic">might </hi>come, or be, useful:—who knows?</p>
         <p>With kind regards,</p>
         <p>Believe me, Dear Sir, </p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
