         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Feby. 20, 1872</p>
         <p>Dear Sir George Grey</p>
         <p>I am very much obliged to you for your kind note about the missing Mss. of your published Book of Maori Poetry. I have communicated its contents to Mr. Locke, and we have written to Wellington, hoping to recover them. And now I have to trouble you about another lot of Maori Mss.</p>
         <p>A few years ago, perhaps ’66, or ’67, (it was when you were here in Napier,—’68,) Mr. Locke came to see me in a hurry to get from me a lot of Maori Mss. of his collecting, which he had kindly lent to me, (but which I had only just glanced at,) these he then wanted to hand over to Mr. McLean for you to look at, and (as both he and I then understood,) to return to him (and to me) when you should have done with them.—I have more than once spoken to Mr. Locke about them, but he has never heard any thing of them since. I now make this application to you, with his knowledge and sanction. He also says, that when he gave the Mss. to Mr. McLean for you, the understanding was, that if you wished to publish them so much the better, as the only object Mr. Locke had in view, was to have them preserved. And I, for my part, only wished to read them closely for new words and new idioms, and (possibly) new usage of words already known. If you have them still by you, could you not send them to me for my perusal? Also, any other Maori Mss. you may happen to have, whether prose or poetry,—you may depend on my taking the utmost care of them, and only using them for the purpose of enriching my Lexicon, which I am still working at;—although entirely cast off—as to any pay—by the Government from March ’70! Could I have once supposed in ’64, (when you, Sir George, as Governor, expressed such a deep interest in the work,) that the Government would not heartily co-operate, I would never have undertaken it.</p>
         <p>If you have also a <hi rend="italic">spare</hi> copy of your Book in Maori, entitled, “Nga mahinga a nga tupuna Maori, &amp;c.”, (published in ’54, by Willis, Charing Cross,) and you could give it to me, you would confer a very great favor:—as I have tried in England &amp; elsewhere but in vain to get a copy.</p>
         <p>I have recently received another lot of old Hawaiian Books, which have gratified me much. Our language (that is the ancient Polynesian) must have been originally a grand yet simple one; like many other things, beautiful and majestic in its simplicity and purity <hi rend="italic">i.e. </hi>without any foreign admixture; as it is, the various streams of descent, or Dialects, are (or were,) magnificent in their ruins. What would I not give thoroughly to know them <hi rend="italic">all</hi>! So as to have them at my fingers’ ends.—</p>
         <p>I trust you, with all your many advantages, are continuing to do all you can to conserve what little remains to be gathered here in N.Z. I feel assured that a future generation will marvel at our <hi rend="italic">past </hi>apathy in this matter.</p>
         <p>I see, by late Papers, that an ancient Ynca Drama, translated from the Quichua, or Aztec, language, of the time of the Peruvian Incas, has just been published: also a Grammar and Dictionary of that language by the same Scholar.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well, I am,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir G. Grey,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
