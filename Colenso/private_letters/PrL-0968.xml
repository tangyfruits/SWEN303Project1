         <p>Dear Hans Mortensen</p>
         <p>I duly received your kind letter of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. instant, also the berries you had so kindly got for me, from the woods, some days before; and I should have written to you sooner, only I have been desirous of going down to town first, and looking out some books for your 3 dear children, now that I know their names. I packed my parcel for you and them yesterday, and hope you may receive it all right, and that I shall please the 3 little dears. A book of pictures is such a nice thing for a child in a wet day.</p>
         <p>I was pleased to get from you, your children’s names, and to know that you and your good wife had given them the <hi rend="italic">well-remembered </hi>names of your own dear Father, and of your two Grandmothers; and I was further pleased to know that you were all well, after that wet and stormy weather. The winter here has been a fine one, and is now two-thirds over, so spring will soon be here, &amp; there, too, with you: and the children, dear creatures, will go merrily away to school—and the shrubs and trees around you will again be in flower: well, I hope, please <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, to visit the Bush again in the early spring.</p>
         <p>
