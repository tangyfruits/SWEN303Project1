         <p rend="end">Napier, January 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1897.</p>
         <p>Dear William,</p>
         <p>Already are we come to the end of the first month of the New Year! which began shortly after we last parted at Dannevirke. And as I have been thinking pretty much of you (and other friends and acquaintances in the Bush district,) I have determined to write you a few lines—to let you know you are <hi rend="italic">not </hi>forgotten.</p>
         <p>Shall I tell you what has mainly caused me to have you in remembrance? I will do so.—</p>
         <p>1. The Evening Star, <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi>, which we together looked at: shining at times with great brilliancy, and every night altering her position in her revolution round the sun; couple with the thought,— “I wonder if William is noticing her movements?” Ere very long she will be <hi rend="italic">gone </hi>from our evening sky.</p>
         <p>2. Your <hi rend="italic">late </hi>Races: I suppose you had holiday on that occasion and was there at Tahoraiti: I have not heard any thing of them. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, that same day, the town was shut up for the annual Caledonian sports, the weather too being very fine. I did not go to see them though near me, but I heard their music passing-by.—</p>
         <p>3. The Eclipse of the Sun,—which is to come off on Tuesday morning next, February 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>., it will begin early about <hi rend="italic">sunrise</hi>, and if the sky is clear of clouds will prove an interesting sight. If you are not habitually an early riser, I would recommend you to do so <hi rend="italic">for once </hi>to see it; Father, or one of your loving sisters, could rouse you, if needs be by having a string tied to your toe, or foot, when you go to bed!!—but I hope you may not require <hi rend="italic">that. </hi>As you cannot look at the sun without some coloured glass—a bit of common window-glass well smoked over a candle or lamp, will answer very well:—but <hi rend="italic">prepare it the day before.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I hope you are well in health, and getting on steadily in your ancient and useful employ by Father’s side. At <hi rend="italic">present </hi>I cannot say when I may revisit the Bush and your rising town, but I look forward to my doing so in the early autumn. I am keeping well, and (as usual) very busy—for <hi rend="italic">I love work</hi>.</p>
         <p>Kind regards to your Parents and you—and <hi rend="italic">all </hi>at Home.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Dear William,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. A severe gale of wind and rain began last night, and uprooted some of my <hi rend="italic">oldest </hi>Acacia trees, close to house, and the gale is still blowing <hi rend="italic">hard </hi>with rain—10 a.m.</p>
