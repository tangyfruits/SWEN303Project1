         <p rend="end">NAPIER<lb/>NOVEMBER 16/86</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour <lb/>Glenross</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Last night I was once mere gladdened with the sight of your handwriting—in your letter (or <hi rend="italic">note</hi> this time) of the 14th.</p>
         <p>Yesterday I was thinking of writing to you, having <hi rend="italic">made</hi> a spare hour, but I put it off till nearer the day of your mail leaving us.</p>
         <p>I think I wrote to you last, before I went away to the bush on 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Oct. While <hi rend="italic">there</hi> I received your little box of spns of Hepatica, but could make nothing of them. I have tried again today (having brought them from Norsewood a fortnight ago in <hi rend="italic">water</hi> with others from the woods, and so kept them fresh but with same result. I think it is some little Hepatica in an <hi rend="italic">immature</hi> state. Possibly hereafter you may find larger &amp; more mature and perfect spns. I must tell you I felt disappointed up in the bush in receiving your box, and <hi rend="italic">No</hi> letter.</p>
         <p>I had a very sad time of it there. 3 full weeks &amp; almost daily rain. I had only 3 days in the woods. On the 15th weather changed to a Sy “buster,” cold with rain, thermo 43º in parlour w fire. I was seized with <hi rend="italic">Lumbago</hi>—a severe attack, and so a prisoner 8–10 days, and a <hi rend="italic">sad time</hi>. On my return to Napier (pretty well, having spent 2 nights at Waipawa by the way back) and coming up this hill in great heat, and loaded with small luggage,—feeling faint and thirsty I drew a cork of an <hi rend="italic">old bad</hi> pint bottle of Guinness Stout, (no other being handy) and drank about ½ a tumbler. In less than 5 minutes (aye, or 3) I was <hi rend="italic">nowhere</hi>, torn to pieces in stomach, &amp;c, &amp;c, as if I had drunk poison. I could not stand. I was helped up to bed, &amp; I soon sent for Dr H (a rare thing for me to do). By strong <hi rend="italic">remedies</hi>, &amp;c, I got round the next day, so as to be free of <hi rend="italic">pains</hi>, but was very so, so, (weak and listless) living on slops for some days. I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to go to town on <hi rend="italic">business</hi> on Thursday last, and now well, &amp; hope to go thither again on Thursday next.</p>
         <p>You say “You are <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>.” Good. You (and I) are always so. The drying winds are doing mischief (reminding me of your attack) as they always do here on this hill. I fancy you were <hi rend="italic">too early</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Gastrodia</hi>—say mid or end of January. Per­haps <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi> got at their roots, which are edible.</p>
         <p>Mr Hill was at Tarawera last week,and brought me thence some of your big-leaved Moss in good fruit, but inly 3–4 fruitstalks.</p>
         <p>With kindest regards, and hearty wishes for a good jolly Harvest (of wool) at Glenross—</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly          W.Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. I got however a nice lot of <hi rend="italic">novelties</hi> in the way.</p>
