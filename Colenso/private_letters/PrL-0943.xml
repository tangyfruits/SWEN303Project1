         <p rend="end">Napier, Augt. 21/95.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>Yours of 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. is to hand, also those 3 vols. Trans., and, today, a copy “N.Z. Times”, contg. Tregear’s rhapsody, (i.e. review, &amp;c, of same:—a much <hi rend="italic">larger </hi>one was pubd. by Ed. “Herald”, <hi rend="italic">suppt. </hi>17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.) I <hi rend="italic">don’t </hi>wonder at <hi rend="underline italic">T</hi>. writing it: <hi rend="italic">heoi ano</hi>. Vastly too much of <hi rend="italic">that kind </hi>of loose slop now-a-days; to which I set down a good portion of “<hi rend="italic">Larrikinism</hi>”.—I am writing rather early to you, as I have to repay your <hi rend="italic">kind </hi>outlay—this I purpose to get tomorrow when I go down town. It sounds rather curiously—my sending to you <hi rend="italic">re </hi>those 3 vols. at <hi rend="italic">that particular date</hi>: and, in ruminating over your words, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>sale of the other vols.,—I thought that you might have <hi rend="italic">saved</hi> (say) 10/. The parcel came to hand all right, except being rubbed <hi rend="italic">through</hi>, and cover of outside vol. much torn: I purpose sending them to a <hi rend="italic">Free </hi>Library at Home. I am pleased that you <hi rend="italic">saw </hi>that effusion in “D.T.” signed “<hi rend="italic">Deist</hi>”: of course I did not like it, (because, If by a <hi rend="underline italic">stranger</hi>, then I, too, should in a great measure hold <hi rend="italic">w. him</hi>; but, If by a <hi rend="italic">townsman </hi>then, utterly wrong! as he should have remembered that auction of my T.S. last year, for <hi rend="italic">that very purpose</hi>: such was <hi rend="italic">not </hi>from money at hand, nor from Income &amp;c.,—hence I felt it:) I wrote to K. about it, &amp; he read a part of my note to Mac., who wrote a <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> explanation to me as he had <hi rend="underline italic">wholly forgotten</hi> all about that <hi rend="italic">Auction</hi>. M. says, he was averse to the inserting it—but, as it was “written by a poor insignificant working man of the town he pubd’ it, supposing, had he refused, the writer would have set it down to his position.” I hope you see the “D.T.”—Mac. terrible of late on Cohen! I suppose you have had your share of earthq.; that on Saty. evg. last, caused me to make tracks for porch &amp; entry! and this of this mg. (i.45 a.m.) was more severe, &amp; <hi rend="italic">unpleasant</hi>! Thank God no injury. I suppose you <hi rend="italic">knew </hi>Jefferies, Sen. of Taradale, <hi rend="italic">J., with Robjohns</hi>, both <hi rend="italic">gone across </hi>since my last: <hi rend="italic">another call for me</hi>! <hi rend="italic">may I </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">properly</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> heed it</hi>. Sir G. Grey, too, rapidly declining. I am about to make my <hi rend="italic">fresh </hi>Will (long deferred for various reasons), I could wish <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> were here </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">residing</hi>: selfish, of course.</p>
         <p>I have recently written a letter to Dinwiddie (Hon. Secy.) <hi rend="italic">re </hi>my two rejected Papers—a pretty sharp one:—having <hi rend="italic">long waited </hi>for <hi rend="italic">Hill</hi> to be in N., &amp; able to attend Council, H. having been very erratic &amp; rambling of late to Country Schools.—I scarcely conceive what the upshot <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be: one thing is, <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>, pretty certain, viz. that while Travers, Maskell, &amp; Tregear, are the “Governors”, <hi rend="italic">W.C. </hi>stands a poor chance. And then, too, (as Mr. Fenton <hi rend="italic">said </hi>at the Auckld. Meeting) such trash pubd. filling the big vol! (3, for instance, of Taylor Wh’s. lucubrations—which caused Dinwiddie to stare!)</p>
         <p>I note yr. remk. re Buller’s “unpopularity”—<hi rend="italic">I don’t marvel at it</hi>, knowing so much of the <hi rend="italic">old </hi>past! B. has <hi rend="italic">not </hi>ansd. my letter: vexed, I dare say, w. me, &amp; <hi rend="italic">perhaps </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">rightly</hi>. </p>
         <p>I have not been to town much of late—save on Sunday last to Cathedral: I have never yet visited Fannin in his new rooms <hi rend="italic">upstairs</hi> over “Hd.” office, and so, in going to town, I have <hi rend="italic">no one </hi>to call on, or chat with: I feel the want<hi rend="italic"> </hi>of <hi rend="italic">this</hi>: Tiffen told me last week that Mr. J. Anderson had recently “had <hi rend="italic">2 nasty spills</hi>”—falls in his h. I saw J.A., 2 wks. ago, outside, basking, he told me he was <hi rend="italic">very weak</hi> and he seemed so. I hope your Father is keeping well: he is a man I <hi rend="italic">never see</hi>! a note to hand from Bp. Williams, informs me of Synod Meeting on 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Sept., so I shall not be going inland until that is <hi rend="italic">over</hi>—if <hi rend="italic">then</hi>? Robertshawe, who has been very unwell of late, wrote me <hi rend="italic">two pressing </hi>notes last wk., to be <hi rend="italic">there </hi>for last Sunday, and for 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>—their “Social” for Bp. W.—but I preferred remaining <hi rend="italic">here</hi>: there being no necessity for my visit, and always expensive.</p>
         <p>I expect shortly to commence my slaughtering!—many scores of old <hi rend="italic">useless </hi>notes &amp; letters: can you tell me what, or which—if any—of our N.Z. postage stamps are of value? See, if you can, “Herald” of <hi rend="italic">this mg</hi>.—your Cousin R. stood <hi rend="italic">long </hi>to his gun in Ed. Bd. yesty.! also, an “<hi rend="italic">advt</hi>.” (letter) by a firm here, which “D.T.” this evening roundly says, is <hi rend="italic">false</hi>. Also a letter from Dr. Didey. Last Saty. “Herald” refused to pub. Howlett’s letter, naming him—“unsuitable”! I can fancy H. !! more letters from him to me—reqg. <hi rend="italic">long </hi>answers. A curious pt. card from Mrs. Buchanan, Hampden, infg. me, her daughter has lately written a book on early Canterbury Settlers, &amp; she, Mrs. B., will send me a copy on recg. 5/.!!! she writes to <hi rend="italic">me </hi>(of course!) for <hi rend="italic">old acquaintance</hi>. I hope the Comee. now sitting, will be able to derive something <hi rend="italic">good </hi>for Bk. N.Z. a terrible millstone that!!!</p>
         <p>I have only just looked into your “Polynesian Jl.”,—no spare <hi rend="italic">clear-headed </hi>time for it. Have this day finished copying my paper on those <hi rend="italic">3 new Ferns</hi>; it was a v<hi rend="italic">ery heavy job</hi>! at one time I had about 25 vols. (some fol., some 4to) <hi rend="italic">all on Ferns</hi>, here in this living room (brought from the cold back Library) to refer to, &amp; then my right thumb!!!—It is now rapidly getting round, but I have had <hi rend="italic">a time of it</hi>! with regard to <hi rend="italic">scores </hi>of <hi rend="underline italic">little</hi> things.—</p>
         <p>According to my <hi rend="italic">old </hi>calculation &amp;c, we, <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, have entered on “<hi rend="underline italic">spring</hi>”, and cert. <hi rend="italic">our Winter</hi> has been a remarkable one—<hi rend="italic">fine weather</hi>. I hope that w. spring &amp; summer your trade will revive,—also, I should say, all others. Gilberd, Taradale Nursery, Bankrupt! <hi rend="italic">All </hi>stock, <hi rend="italic">every </hi>thing, to be sold off at Auction—a great sacrifice! I see, in Papers, Sir James Hector’s son, has distinguished himself at Edinburgh—I suppose he is <hi rend="italic">no.2.</hi> I had heard of <hi rend="italic">one </hi>being w. Sir J. there in Museum. <hi rend="italic">All you </hi>have so kindly told me of McDougall has served to <hi rend="italic">surprise </hi>me—at same time explains much <hi rend="italic">re </hi>his articles. I was informed, a short time ago, that the <hi rend="italic">sub</hi>-editor of “Herald” is a <hi rend="italic">Romanist</hi>, and is known to have <hi rend="italic">no love </hi>for W.C., I <hi rend="italic">don’t know </hi>him. Bp. Stuart’s sister told me, last wk., the Bp. was well, &amp;c, in Persia. Some <hi rend="italic">nasty </hi>rumours <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Tom Sidey’s fire at Makotuku: it <hi rend="italic">sounds </hi>strange, “£750. worth of <hi rend="italic">unused </hi>furniture stored away in loft over stable”, burnt down, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Insurance heavy</hi>.</p>
         <p>Well, my dear friend, I have given you this evening. Hope this may find you &amp; yours <hi rend="italic">all well</hi>. I am pretty (or, <hi rend="italic">very</hi>) well. A little too much Rheumatism of late, in left arm, elbow, scarcely lift it, <hi rend="italic">at times</hi>, but daily working, appetite good, sleep tolerable, and very much to be thankful for.</p>
         <p>With kindest regards,</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. In town this mg. sorry to hear of <hi rend="italic">severe </hi>illness of Mr. Crerar Senr. no hope I believe. A Dieu.</p>
