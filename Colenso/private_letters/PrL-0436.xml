         <p>Mr J. Drummond</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>First—a Happy New Year to you,—and may this one be the best you have ever known.</p>
         <p>Second—Your most unexpected but welcome letter of 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Decr. reached me this morning—and., while I thank you for it,—I most confess I felt ashamed on seeing it,—for I have had yours of <hi rend="italic">Nov 30 </hi>here before me, on my writing table, a full month, (in company however with others, from N &amp; S.) which I am not forgetting but always going to answer. Of late I have had rather too much to do in the writing way,—but I am bringing the work down, by degrees.</p>
         <p>I have also had a few papers set aside for you,—for, to tell you the truth, I had thoughts it would be little use to send you any until the holidays &amp; their sports were over. With this I post 4 Eng Papers,—in some of them you will find good reading, particularly in the “Times”, (though old). This has been lent to Dr Spencer, Mr Grubb, and others, or you would have had it earlier.</p>
         <p>But now to your <hi rend="italic">last</hi> letter. Shall I say, that I was pleased—vexed, on opening it? I was a wee bit vexed at <hi rend="italic">first sight</hi> on seeing your chq for £6, because there was no need for your sending it so early, especially as in your last you had told me what L had re­ported from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, which you had met with a P.N. for £10, which is also due next month; and I had also said some time ago, if I recollect right­ly, that next year (viz. 81) would be time enough for you to think about me in that matter. Indeed I was thinking of returning it, but on reading your note, and noting its cheerful tenor, and of your being “<hi rend="italic">fortunate</hi>” at your Ongaonga Races,—I thought I had better not do so,—so I accept it with thanks—doubly so, I may say, being the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> money for the year, &amp; quarter ending Dec 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and so I hope it may prove to be an omen for good in the money way.</p>
         <p>I thought on you the other day (Wednesday last) when I passed going &amp; coming through Taradale—I went to see Tareha’s people and the other Maori Chiefs there assembled, as I did not care to go among the lot &amp; crush on the following day. It was dreadfully <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> on the Wednesday; I returned about 1 to MacDonalds, (having hired McCormicks trap) and I had <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> to stay there &amp; rest awhile, &amp; look about your old town, but it was so hot and dry and dusty, &amp; McDonalds house hot, too, within, w. doors closed, that I merely took a glass of beer &amp; came away home.</p>
         <p>Of course you know all the <hi rend="italic">Daily</hi> News. You will have seen, that I have been writing in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> (nearest) paper. I hope you saw the Lunar Eclipse; I did, the whole of it, being up and out till daylight. How is <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">namesake</hi>? two letters and not a word;—With kind regards believe me yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso</p>
