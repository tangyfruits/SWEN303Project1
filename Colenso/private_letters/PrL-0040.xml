         <p>Ki a te Mea,</p>
         <p>Kei Wangarei e noho ana.</p>
         <p rend="end">Waimate, July 15,/1843.</p>
         <p>My dear friend,</p>
         <p>I have scarcely time to write a line, and I know not if when written it may reach you, but I will notwithstanding make the experiment; a Native going to Owae affords me a kind of opportunity.</p>
         <p>Yesterday the Bishop appointed me to visit Wangarei and the Coast in the middle and latter end of August, so I hope to see you on Saturday night the 26 of August; I shall go by way of the Coast and Ngunguru, thence to Tamatarau, and finish at Tauatawiti, returning by Wairua. I have but a few days allowed me, and must therefore make but a flying visit.</p>
         <p>I wrote you a hurried line or two the other day: I dare say you have again visited the Bay since we left it as Milne has been in. The Columbine is not yet arrived, nor Mr. Busby; that is when I last heard.</p>
         <p>I have no news to send you, here, in the midst of the Ngahere’s, I hear and see nought save trees and kaka’s:—Kei te moana anake nga pipi.</p>
         <p>I hope you got well home, and that now yourself and family are quite well: remember us <hi rend="italic">most kindly</hi> to <hi rend="italic">all</hi>.</p>
         <p>We are living in Mr. Preece’s old house; and though it has but 2 rooms, yet we have enough, and are pretty comfortable.</p>
         <p>I sometimes think on you and other old friends: we are getting more and more separated from each other, but I hope, through God’s abounding mercy, we shall all meet together at last “to go no more out for ever”: that, my dear friend, will be a happy meeting,—we shall ever have done with sorrow, care, and the 1000 troubles and ills of life, and shall “be for ever with the Lord”.</p>
         <p>Remember me kindly to Mr. Kier, who, I hope, is comfortable, and believe me</p>
         <p>               Very truly yours</p>
         <p>                               W. Colenso.</p>
