         <p rend="end">Novr. 1/95</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>This mg. I was <hi rend="italic">suddenly </hi>attacked while sitting at breakfast with the <hi rend="italic">severest </hi>disorder of diarrhoea I think I ever remember!—I was going to Hill’s this aftn. &amp; evg. and had looked forward to it with pleasure—but, alas! had to give up all thoughts of it. All morning I have been <hi rend="italic">unfitted</hi> for anything, fortunately no pain: and this aftn. after several fruitless attempts to <hi rend="italic">do something</hi>—I read what remained over yesty. of Buller’s matter (so thoughtfully furnished by you) and then, again took up your long &amp; capital letter, and this really interested me considerably (you had done it—your Society’s meeting—so graphically! so naturally!) so that I determined to write a little <hi rend="italic">more </hi>to <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi> this evening, to follow mine of yesterday. I am right glad you came out in that way—<hi rend="italic">re </hi>Solander, Parkinson, &amp;c. (you will be sure to find out Kirk—as time rolls on—<hi rend="italic">always </hi>a mean plagiarist—<hi rend="italic">&amp; worse. </hi>Re <hi rend="italic">Dactylanthus</hi>: this plant has been mentioned several times (in past vols. “Trans.”) be me, as in my “3 Literary Papers”, p.12;—see, “Trans.” vol.  p,  , and I think there was also a paper by Hamilton respecting it. Kirk can<hi rend="italic">add nothing</hi> to it, not known before, it is still <hi rend="italic">rare</hi>, and a true parasite. You mention “drawings of it”,—by whom? <hi rend="italic">copies</hi>, it may be!—Just look into Taylor’s “<hi rend="italic">N.Z. and its inhabitants</hi>”, 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi> ed. 1870, vol.II pp. 696–700, there you will have <hi rend="italic">Hooker’s full </hi>description, with a fine plate &amp; analysis, (copied from a larger &amp; <hi rend="italic">finer</hi> one in the Linnean Trans. royal 4to.,) and perhaps you may find the <hi rend="italic">origin</hi> of Kirk’s drawings! Buller (I find) remarks— “This plant was first observed, &amp; <hi rend="italic">carefully </hi>described by Taylor”—<hi rend="italic">NO</hi>: by Hooker. T. made a <hi rend="italic">mess </hi>of it (as usual w. him!) and <hi rend="italic">B. </hi>too often does the same—from inattention (<hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi>), <hi rend="italic">I have had to remind B. of it.</hi>—</p>
         <p>I read w. delight your account of the Hudson <hi rend="italic">farce</hi>: I hope, that both you &amp; Maskell, &amp; others, may ever be ready to prune such nonsense. Perhaps you are not aware that Hudson, <hi rend="italic">too</hi>, deals in cribbed wares? not a few of his (?) Insects were known, &amp; published, &amp; <hi rend="italic">figures </hi>of them given, 50 years ago!—<hi rend="italic">I have them </hi>here, in Zoology of Erebus &amp; Terror, (and not a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> of them I also furnished). How would sapient Hudson manage at the <hi rend="italic">extreme N.</hi>—Lapland, Greenland, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>that Great Barrier Island Bubble! I opposed it, from the beginning, in replying to the Letters, Circulars, &amp;c, sent to me, &amp; so far, vexed both B. and the projector—or Managers. I looked on it, as part &amp; parcel of Buller’s “<hi rend="italic">Huia</hi>” story to Ld. Onslow. It will never succeed.—</p>
         <p>And so <hi rend="italic">you </hi>have entered or completed 46!! Heigh ho! well do I remember <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as a <hi rend="italic">boy</hi>, in ’61, at Stark’s auction: what have <hi rend="italic">we </hi>gone thro’ since? </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">With you</hi>—I lament your <hi rend="italic">not </hi>being occupied with literary wk. Could not <hi rend="italic">that </hi>be brought about? and so relinquish the practical? For my part I have always been against your leaving N., and Craig &amp; others (your friends) have <hi rend="italic">expressed </hi>the same—partly, I believe, through these <hi rend="italic">new </hi>printers doing so well in Emerson Street. At same time, I must allow, that it is partly <hi rend="underline italic">selfish</hi> on my part: alas! I would that <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi> were <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>
         <p>(Continuation: part II. Novr. 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.)<lb/>I have been 2–3 times ashamed &amp; vexed, at seeing part I. still here on my writing-table, and now I will conclude, and post tomorrow.</p>
         <p>Hill (I <hi rend="italic">regret to say</hi>) left town on 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. for Bush &amp; Coast (Waimio, &amp;c.) without seeing me: I fancy he is <hi rend="italic">vexed </hi>(or Mrs H.)—perhaps through <hi rend="italic">not </hi>knowing what was the matter with me. Since my last to you, I have managed to ansr. Hamilton’s <hi rend="underline italic">long</hi> epistle! He not only writes <hi rend="italic">extra </hi>long letters on <hi rend="italic">large </hi>paper, but his “graphy” is so very small that I cannot make it out by night; I have now Dr. Hocken’s to reply to (including his <hi rend="underline italic">long</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> lecture</hi>—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> translation from the <hi rend="underline italic">Dutch</hi>! of Tasman’s log,) <hi rend="italic">and </hi>his p. in vol. XXVII. Howlett, too, I have managed to answer, but not to please him, I think; I enclose one of his <hi rend="italic">last </hi>pub. (sent to me) please return it—by-&amp;-by. Did I tell you, that I have lately recd. vol. XXVII? Last week, Gore sent me my copy of vol. XXVII—the next day came <hi rend="italic">another </hi>copy (this one addressed <hi rend="italic">by him</hi>) with a long note of explanation: I have since written to him—that “I have <hi rend="italic">now </hi>2 copies—am I to keep both?” Some one at Wgn. sent me a copy of “Evg. Post” contg. the long art. on the Buller <hi rend="italic">fracas</hi>. Did I tell you, of a letter from R.Sy.—asking, “If I will be one of a Committee <hi rend="italic">re </hi>a suitable Memorial to Huxley?” I have assented—<hi rend="italic">adding</hi>, “What can <hi rend="italic">I do</hi>—at <hi rend="italic">this distance</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">this age</hi>”—The Dean went yesty. to Gisborne, having long promised his old chum Webb to do so: St. Hill (I believe) will officiate in his absence. Carlile, who was very ill, I see, is back looking wonderfully better—which I am glad to see. “Own Correspdt” (Waipawa) states—that “Mackenzie is coming to look at &amp; <hi rend="italic">purchase, Mt Vernon </hi>for the Govt.—to cut up into small farms”. I have had one Visitor—since my last, Revd. W. Welsh (St. Augustine’s): I do not want too many: I am working, quietly, on some of the Ruahine plants—Hill’s, Olsen’s, Andrews’, &amp; other collectors: some nice things among them—but, alas! Hill’s, by far the superior lot, are in a wretched rotten state. I was on them when Tregear called, &amp; I showed T. some of them. In my long letter to Buller, last week, I called his attention to my descr. &amp;c. of a new Lizard, that <hi rend="italic">changed its colour</hi> &amp;c, &amp;c, (“Trans.” XVII, p.149.) [after all, I fear, I <hi rend="italic">omitted </hi>to do so!!!] But I took him (<hi rend="italic">again</hi>) to task, for adopting the Maori <hi rend="italic">myth </hi>of Hawaiki (in his paper)—telling him, <hi rend="underline italic">he</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> ought </hi>to have <hi rend="italic">abandoned </hi>that long ago. I sent him some fine <hi rend="italic">Cordiceps </hi>50 (&amp; more!) years old. Did you know Rev. Mr. Stewart (Presbytn.) who was for some years at Woodville, and removed to Greymouth?—Well, I knew him very well (early made his acq. when a student, &amp; went purposely to Wdv., to be <hi rend="italic">at his </hi>ordinn.) After his removal, we corresponded, I, too, sending him papers, but <hi rend="italic">he </hi>fell off (last L. from him, Decr./93, &amp; then crying peccavi!<note xml:id="ftn3-759" place="foot" n="759"> I have sinned.</note>)—very often have I enqd. about him—no one <hi rend="italic">here</hi> seemed to know: <hi rend="italic">yesty</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">long letter</hi>, folio fcp., with photo—self, wife, &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">six</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>bairnies! (a very good pict. reminding me of <hi rend="italic">your family </hi>one—&amp; of others, I have): <hi rend="italic">Again</hi>—apologies, &amp;c—He seems to be doing <hi rend="italic">well</hi> in Ch. matters. One curious item; when he came to Wdv., he had 2 children, <hi rend="italic">twins</hi>, bith girls, &amp; both so much alike, that, in all my callings, &amp;c. I cod. never disting. any diffce. (at that early time <hi rend="italic">under </hi>2 years). He has written a nice Xn. loving letter—which I must answer. Don’t forget names (in full) of all yours tho’ youngest, I think, <hi rend="italic">not </hi>in <hi rend="italic">family </hi>picture. </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">This L.</hi> requires no special answers.</p>
         <p>Good bye. Kindest regards to you &amp; <hi rend="italic">all.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Yours sincerely,           W. Colenso.</p>
