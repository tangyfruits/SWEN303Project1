         <p rend="end">Napier, October 12/81</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Thanks for your kind note of 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., which came to hand yesterday—while I was taking a bit of a <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>! and engaged in making the enclosed sketch of 2 Teeth of some unknown Mammal for you.</p>
         <p>I received these 2 teeth last week; they were found “in yellowish clay,” in sinking an artesian well at Meeanee, at a depth of 117 feet: they had sunk to 112 ft. and no water; at 117 they again pulled-out the plug, and up rushed water, &amp;c., &amp; among it were these 2 teeth. They are quite perfect, and in excellent preservation only a little stained; the fangs are hollow—I took out some of our blue papa mud (loose) from one of them. I was much pleased w. them, hoping they may prove to be of some slight service, and if they were my own I would send them to you at once; but, at <hi rend="italic">present</hi>, I have only the loan of them. Those fellows, <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, think all their little finds are of <hi rend="italic">enormous</hi> value! (One, last year, wanted, “at least! £2.” for a shark’s tooth (<hi rend="italic">Carcharias</hi>) it was a fine specimen.) What struck me as being peculiar in these, is the manner in which the enamel is laid on,—the bone running up to such a very long and acute angle (as in <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> figs. 1 &amp; 2.). If you wish to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> them, <hi rend="italic">let me know early</hi>, as I will try to get permission to send them.—</p>
         <p>Our long deferred Ordinary Meeting came off on Monday night last,—I send you, enclosed, a clipping from yesterday’s paper, which is pretty correct. It was certainly an interesting one, particularly the <hi rend="italic">discussion</hi>! Such as I had scarcely before witnessed here: only fancy, our 9, 10, ladies keeping their seats (and apparently <hi rend="italic">greatly interested</hi>) from 7.30 till 10.20. Dr. Spencer was, unfortunately, absent, having been called away to a serious accident 25 miles off in the Country, &amp; was travelling nearly all night. I was much pleased in hearing from the Bishop (President), who had lately returned from the N., that the “Mao. Scholars” were also against Stack. Stack has strange <hi rend="italic">crude</hi> notions. I should send the Paper now with this, but I have the <hi rend="italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">nd</hi> 
            <hi rend="italic">. Appendix</hi> to copy. (I took it in rough draft only, having been unwell of late,) but I will send it on Saturday next by Mail Str.,—if not too much broken-in upon,—this being gala <hi rend="italic">time</hi> here! (I cannot say “gala <hi rend="italic">day</hi>”—for the Napierians and H. Bay folks are in for 4 successive days of it!!—a <hi rend="italic">Carnival.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I am pleased in hearing of your <hi rend="italic">good Botanical Section </hi>for vol. xiv., and doubly so at the promised figs. for Buchanan’s new alpine discoveries.—I, also, shall have a short Botanical paper, on a few <hi rend="italic">new</hi> plants. I would that I could have enlisted (<hi rend="italic">through you</hi>) Buchanan to make me a few drawings,—or, some other equally talented Botanical draughtsman. I received direct from Berggren a copy of his work on some of our Alpines: of course, you got one: I lament its being in <hi rend="italic">Swedish</hi>.—</p>
         <p>From what you say, you are likely to be overwhelmed with Papers this season, and I almost doubt your finding room for this—to be sent in a day or two. Could you not <hi rend="italic">enlarge</hi> your vol.? <hi rend="italic">I will subscribe £10. </hi>(privately), and perhaps get more from our Society.</p>
         <p>I enclose an offl. note to Mr. Gore, written last week,—<hi rend="italic">re</hi> the election of a member to vote.</p>
         <p>I am, my dear Sir,</p>
         <p>very truly yours,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
