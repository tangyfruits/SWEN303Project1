         <p rend="end">Napier July 13/66</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have recently received a letter from a Botanical Correspondent at Auckland, in which he says,—</p>
         <p>“Can you recommend me to a likely purchaser of my Collection of <hi rend="italic">British</hi> plants? It comprises specimens of about 1400 forms of Phænogams, Filices, &amp;c. and about 340 Mosses. The Flowg. Plants &amp; Ferns unmounted, arranged between sheets of demy sized (18 x 11) paper: the Mosses in part neatly mounted on small sheets &amp; part in envelopes, all correctly named, localized. &amp;c. and could be mounted to order. It is really a good Collection, &amp; I am thoroughly sorry, to be obliged to offer it for sale.”—</p>
         <p>There is no one <hi rend="italic">here</hi> to whom I could even mention the subject! And I have thought—you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be able to give a better answer, &amp; so I have written to you. Please mention the matter to Dr. Knight in particular:—although Dr. Knight may have the British Mosses.—</p>
         <p>We had rain on the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. for the first time—for many a long day—(I had nearly said, from <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I left you at Wgn!) and again yesterday—nice good rain, the trees &amp; plants of all kinds were jubilant &amp; thankful.</p>
         <p>I fear that the <hi rend="italic">Caladiun </hi>roots are much too big, and they are beginning to grow—shoot—But I will examine them again tomorrow;—and if fit, will forward some.</p>
         <p>We had a slight shock of an earthq. yesterday mg., near 8 o’clock; only a gentle rouser—but with preceding <hi rend="italic">rumble.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>We know nothing of your stirring times—as yet:—only we have just received a Copy of the Governor’s speech.—</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well</p>
         <p>I am         My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I know nothing <hi rend="italic">personally </hi>of the person who is “obliged” to sell his Herbarium—but I have ever entertained a very high opinion of him—for probity, &amp;c.—from the general tenor of the numerous letters I have received from him. W.C.</p>
