         <p rend="end">Napier, Sunday<lb/>August 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. 1880.</p>
         <p>My dear Enys</p>
         <p>Many thanks for your kind note of August 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. with enclosures of small ferns,—and also your book, packet of plates, &amp;c., of our N.Z. Butterflies and Moths.</p>
         <p>I wrote to you, much about the same time, and also sent you a big (!) packet, containing, however, only a few small specimens of ferns—and, I suppose our notes and ferns crossed each other in transit.</p>
         <p>I felt glad that I sent off mine to you, before yours put in an appearance.—</p>
         <p>I could not write by Steamer going S. yesterday, therefore I write today, to go by overland mail to Wellington in the morning. I have been going through your little lot of ferns sent in your letter, and am greatly pleased with them, particularly with the <hi rend="italic">little wee one</hi>, of which <hi rend="italic">I want more &amp; better specimens</hi> (if you have them to spare), and will thank you to send me some,—<hi rend="italic">in all its sizes and forms</hi>, both fruitful &amp; barren, and tell me <hi rend="italic">where</hi> you got it, on <hi rend="italic">what </hi>growing, &amp;c, &amp;c,—I hope it may prove to be a <hi rend="italic">new </hi>species, and if so, I shall with pleasure name it after <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. But there are so many species and varieties of <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllum </hi>in these seas, that it behoves one to be careful. I think I have one of the completest Fern <hi rend="italic">Libraries</hi> in N.Z.! still, there is nothing like copious specimens.</p>
         <p>Were you aware of there being 4 species of ferns in your small mixed lot? I ask this, as they were all mixed together. Three of them grow here, and have been long known to me, and to Dr. Sir J. Hooker: the biggest (single young specimen) is <hi rend="italic">H. multifidium </hi>(in one of its many varieties): the next in size (and several specimens) is what Dr. Hooker (and Baker and others) call <hi rend="italic">H. unilaterale</hi>,—but which I have always disputed; I found it on Ruahine in 1846;—the next is a small variety of what <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">H. Tunbridgense</hi>; but <hi rend="italic">I should like to see more of it</hi>, and to have more of them all, for close comparison and dissection,—if you have any to spare.</p>
         <p>I note that while you (in your useful notes) quote Mr Sturm’s memo to me, respecting <hi rend="italic">Danais </hi>(sp.), which I had forwarded to Dr. Hector,—you overlook what I had previously written on the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> Butterfly, having <hi rend="italic">reared it here</hi>. My paper, too, follows <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> what you have republished, from vol. X. Trans. N.Z.I.—</p>
         <p>But being very busy (as usual! for our Institute) I must defer what more I have to say on our Butterflies until my next.</p>
         <p>                             Hoping you are quite well, I am,</p>
         <p>                                                             Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                                                                     W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I suppose you have your copy of vol. XII.—I have again some more of my writing!</p>
