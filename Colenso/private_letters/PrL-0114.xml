         <p rend="end">Church Mission Station</p>
         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Feby. 2, 1852.</p>
         <p>My dear Mr. Archdeacon,</p>
         <p>I only returned to my Stn. on the evening of the 31st. ulto., from accompanying the Bishop of New Zealand on his journey to Te Wairoa.</p>
         <p>In the course of our conversation his Lordship informed me, that you had felt much, some remarks of mine (as published by the C.M.S. in their Report for 1848–49, ) which seemed to bear upon the Natives of your District.—</p>
         <p>I cannot tell you how grieved I am, that I should have been the unhappy means of causing you pain.</p>
         <p>I now hasten to do all that I can towards removing from your mind all such ideas as, that I then intended to reflect, or, that I then at all reflected on the Natives resident in your Missionary District; or, that, in writing as I then did, I stepped at all beyond my proper sphere of assigned duties.</p>
         <p>For which purpose I enclose two papers; one, (no. i) being the copy of an official Note with which the Archdeacon of this District honoured me; and one, (no. ii) an extract from my Journal; which has long since been sent to the CMS., and which (with other similar entries made during that journey,) gave rise to the remarks in question.</p>
         <p>Of course, my dear Mr. Archdeacon, you will understand me to assume, that (in case the strong language used by me in my Report, is fully borne out by equally powerful facts narrated in my Journal,) the only cause of uneasiness lies in my having (seemingly) reported upon Natives not belonging to my charge.</p>
         <p>This assumption of mine is, I suppose, placed beyond all doubt, from the bare fact of even stronger language than mine having been used by the Rev. R. Taylor, when speaking of some Natives of those very Tribes, and of the same localities as those mentioned by me. And which statement of Mr. Taylor appears the more suitable for me here to notice, not only from its having also been published by the CMS. in their Report for that year, but on the very opposite page to that on which my (censorable?) remarks are given!</p>
         <p>If I conjecture aright, the Rev. S. Williams had not, at the period mentioned in the extract from my Journal, then arrived to reside at Otaki; and you yourself were both confined to your bed and very weak, so as to preclude your even knowing the real state of some of (I believe) the most careless of those Native Tribes.—</p>
         <p>It may be that I have generally taken too gloomy a view of the Moral and Religious state of the Natives. I know, that, in so doing I differ widely from many of my brethren. Be this however as it may, two things, I hope, will be fully allowed me;—first, That I have always in my Journals endeavoured to give a faithful uncoloured statement of facts; and, second, That I am not altogether ignorant of the Native Character.—</p>
         <p>I have the honor to be,</p>
         <p> my dear Mr. Archdeacon,</p>
         <p>Your very obedient Servant,</p>
         <p> William Colenso. (True copy.)</p>
         <p rend="center">Enclosure, No. i. (copy.)<lb/>______</p>
         <p>Archdeaconry of Waiapu with provisional charge of Archdeaconry of Kapiti.</p>
         <p>Mr. Colenso’s Circuit, twice in the year, in the spring and autumn quarters.</p>
         <p>Including Wairarapa and the valley of the Hutt.—</p>
         <p>               (signed) G.A. N Zealand.</p>
         <p>               True copy, W. Williams.</p>

         <p rend="center">Enclosure, No. ii.</p>
         <p>Extracted from Journal,—Octr. 30th., and 31st. to “corrupt good manners.” And, also, Novr. 4th. to “we know them not now.”</p>
         <p>Adding, (in the margin,)— “Vide, if required, my Letter to the Lt. Govr., dated March 15/48, pars. 10, 12, for more full information on this distressing subject. I mention this, here, because the truth of these facts was then strictly enquired into. W.C.</p>
