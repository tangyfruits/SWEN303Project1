         <p rend="end">Napier, March 13, 1865</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>By this Mail I send you—in a Book-packet—the remaining portion of the Essay on the Maori Races:—<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>.</p>
         <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> to that Essay (therein referred to);</p>
         <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Appendix, No. I</hi>.,—a Comp. Table of Polyn. Dialects, &amp;c. also,</p>
         <p>3. A small addition (of half a short sentence; and a footnote) to be added to that Essay; and,</p>
         <p>4. Half a sheet of Corrections of a few Printer’s Errors in your Official Catalogue.</p>
         <p>I can assure you I am right glad to have done with it—for the time at least. I have striven hard throughout to do justice to both sides, (within the narrow limits allowed me—of time &amp; space,) and also, to give useful interesting information in the <hi rend="italic">notes</hi>. I think they will prove to be of a popular nature. I suppose your printers will have <hi rend="italic">music type </hi>(as ours have here!)—if they have not, you will of course alter that note to suit.</p>
         <p>I had a Copy of your Official Catalogue lent me (by an acquaintance just returned from Otago,) for a few hours; and perceiving a few <hi rend="italic">errata</hi> respecting my exhibits I have enclosed (in the Book packet) a sheet of corrections. I had not time to go fully into the Catalogue, but I also noticed several errors (typographical) in the scientific spelling of some of your Bot. exhibits—which I suppose you will see to.—</p>
         <p>I value Forster’s works much:—and have always thought very highly of the man (or men, <hi rend="italic">pater</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">et</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">fil.</hi>)—I am sure you would like to dip into them. As you have my “Cook’s Voy.” I availed myself of my <hi rend="italic">privilege</hi>, and borrowed from the General Assembly Library, 2 vols. Of the same work—hence my quotations.</p>
         <p>My next immediate job, is to work up my <hi rend="italic">Crypts</hi>. For Dr. Hooker: which I hope and shall try hard to have ready for April Mail hence. Did you receive the nuts of <hi rend="italic">Aleurites </hi>(Candle-nut), and were they of any service?</p>
         <p>It has occurred to me to ask you (since you may have some Polynesian visitors—I mean <hi rend="italic">Europeans </hi>residing in the Islands,)—Could you get me any of the <hi rend="italic">local </hi>publications in their respective dialects:—or, put me in a way to get them? Does any of your merchants trade, &amp;c—with any of these Islands?</p>
         <p>Again wishing you every success—and that I were nearer,</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
