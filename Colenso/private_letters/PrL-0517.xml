         <p rend="end">Napier, Friday night<lb/>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Lest you should be <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi> surprised in receiving a letter written <hi rend="italic">by me</hi> from Napier <hi rend="italic">this week</hi>, (after what I had told you a week ago in my last.) I will just add, that on Sunday morning (15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) I was suddenly seized with Lumbago—&amp; obliged to go to bed!—I managed to get downstairs yesterday, and in the afternoon Dr. Spencer called w. your telegram, &amp; we set to work, (no time to lose,) &amp; this day <hi rend="italic">they</hi> did the required work: <hi rend="italic">I could not move out</hi>, but all the required papers were sent to me, and so I have written to you.——</p>
         <p>This unexpected, <hi rend="italic">unwished</hi> for, attack, has thrown me back, &amp; will hinder my forest visiting for a <hi rend="italic">few days</hi> (not longer, I hope,)—far better however to be attacked <hi rend="italic">here</hi> than there.</p>
         <p>I am much better today</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. Your telegram quite rejoiced me; I would we had known of <hi rend="italic">that mode</hi> being admissable before. W.C.</p>
