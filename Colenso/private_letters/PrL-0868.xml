         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>You <hi rend="italic">may </hi>be a wee bit surprised at the above heading, and it is a kind of unexpected chance affair.—I left Napier on Saty. 27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. for W-p-rau—D. Service there on 28<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. (&amp; <hi rend="underline italic">my last</hi>!)—on that day (27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>) the weather—that had been <hi rend="italic">so long </hi>wet!—<hi rend="italic">seemed </hi>to change “for good”—&amp; the Sunday was a truly glorious day—such a novelty <hi rend="italic">with us</hi>. So on Monday mg. it was fine—I wired to this place to know if my 2 rooms were disengaged, &amp;, such being the case, I came on: rain, however, again! last night, &amp; every thing wet &amp; muddy this mg., with <hi rend="italic">strong </hi>Sy. wind, keeps me indoors—but I have no wtg. materials. Unforty. too, my hand is outrageously shaky this mg., which, of late, is too often the case early in the day! but <hi rend="italic">you </hi>will I know be able to decypher my scrawl.—The Parsonage at W-p-u having been renovated, Tuke comes hither with family &amp; household goods this day, &amp; the Bp. will be there next Sunday to “induct” him—&amp; leave him to his work.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Trestrail had been to N. &amp; Clive staying, a fort., but I saw her in her house yesty. wk. (22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>) &amp; spent an hour w. her, she was well—we spoke of <hi rend="italic">you </hi>&amp; she desires to be kindly rememd. I went thither again yesty. mg. but she was <hi rend="italic">out</hi>: I placed one of her pots of plants at her door step! &amp; told Mrs. Winlove of it, &amp; to <hi rend="italic">tell her</hi>. We had a good Congn. on Sy. <hi rend="italic">mg. </hi>Mrs. Russell &amp; Mrs. Gaisford among them—often there when weather permitted, I saw yr. Cousin Rechab yesty. on platform at Ry. Station &amp; also <hi rend="italic">in </hi>carriage (I think one of his daughters was a passgr.) &amp; had a few words w. him—&amp; the wk. before w. your Uncle John—both seemed very well. I hope Mr. Grant &amp; Mrs. Tuke may <hi rend="italic">pull well </hi>together: Mr.G. was away on the Coast the Sy. before (21) in terrible weather, &amp; Mrs. Dodd of Kaikoura there in his (<hi rend="underline italic">your</hi>) place: D. is spoken <hi rend="italic">well </hi>of, but I don’t know him.</p>
         <p>I suppose you will have heard of Death of “Sandy” Grant? &amp; of R. Price <hi rend="italic">giving up </hi>Editorship of “D.T.”—going at last! into sheepfarming!!—</p>
         <p>I have done but little of late save weekly attending to Ch. work—Taradale &amp; W-p-u: this however is now ended—it has much interfered w. other wk.—taking me 3 (or even 4) days every week.</p>
         <p>[pages 4, 5 missing]</p>
         <p>We (you &amp; I) <hi rend="italic">don’t </hi>see, &amp; think, alike in many things—nor is such to be expected—yet I would that <hi rend="italic">you </hi>were a little more <hi rend="italic">reasonable </hi>in this great Tempce. matter:—&amp; when I write <hi rend="italic">reasonable</hi>, I mean more <hi rend="italic">natural</hi>—more <hi rend="italic">truly Xn.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I expect I may return to N. this <hi rend="italic">week</hi>: all letters, &amp;c, are <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, &amp; I have no Books, &amp;c, with me. I <hi rend="italic">wish </hi>to visit the woods, rt. &amp; left, while here—I suppose my <hi rend="italic">last visit </hi>for this season—winter now setting in. Hill came out last wk. w. lecture at W-p-u., but attendce. <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>—or next to that; and I see by paper, yesty, he was to Lecture <hi rend="italic">last n. </hi>at Makotuku: I left wd. for him there—in passing, that I was <hi rend="italic">here</hi>: in his travelling from Wainui to Dvk., in “awful” weather he was thrown <hi rend="italic">into mud</hi>! &amp; got a sprained wrist. Did you know Ferguson’s Father? (F. in Fannin’s office) He died 3–4 wks. back, suddenly in chair; on autopsy his spine was found to be drawn in almost to touch breast bone! &amp; so it was <hi rend="italic">not asthma </hi>from which he had so long suffered: F. (son) wrote me a <hi rend="italic">long </hi>account of his last days—<hi rend="italic">his end was </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">peace</hi>.</p>
         <p>Of <hi rend="italic">late</hi>—I have had, for the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>time, strong (growing!) desire to return to England—to my old Cornish Home! I have <hi rend="italic">large </hi>family <hi rend="italic">there</hi> from whom I get warm letters by every mail, &amp; <hi rend="italic">not a single soul in N.Z</hi>.—&amp; <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—one of my <hi rend="italic">few </hi>close &amp; intimate friends—<hi rend="italic">far </hi>away! Were this month now, <hi rend="italic">Jany.</hi>—it is possible I might put things into <hi rend="italic">some kind </hi>of order? &amp; flit, although I have every reason for believing I should <hi rend="italic">not long </hi>survive my arrival.</p>
         <p>I may tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—that I don’t think I shall undertake any more Ch. Duty—for this winter.—–</p>
         <p>I see in Herald of this mg. that the Woman’s League (Franchise &amp; what not besides!!) of Napier have finished their Petition 14½ yds. long, not reckoning heading &amp; 1442 signatures—the members do not desire any electl. privileges that are not extended to men, but simply electl. equality w. men, nothing more &amp; nothing less!! “Mrs Emily Hill President”, Ugh! for the rule of the Houhynhyms!!—or Amazons!!!</p>
         <p>I have had to wade thro’ rain <hi rend="italic">mire </hi>nearly ¼ m. to P.O. to obtain P.N. &amp; stamps, tho’ said P.O. <hi rend="italic">close </hi>to me!!—</p>
         <p>I hope this may find you, &amp; yours, all well, &amp; with much affection I am, Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>                             W. Colenso.</p>
