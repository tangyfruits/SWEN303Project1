         <p rend="end">Ch. Miss. Station, </p>
         <p rend="end">Waitangi,</p>
         <p rend="end">August 1, 1851.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>In a prodigious hurry I scribble you a few sentences:—</p>
         <p>—To <hi rend="italic">thank you</hi> for your excessively kind note, and all its accompaniments, which I found at Ngaawapurua, on the Saturday after you had left.</p>
         <p>—To express my great regret that you should have deprived yourself of what you certainly needed far beyond myself—and</p>
         <p>—To tell you, that I have little or nothing to say—being <hi rend="italic">still</hi> on the tip-toe of expectation of getting some Letters, &amp;c, per “<hi rend="italic">Rose</hi>”, now due.</p>
         <p>I reached the Station (by forced marches) by the end of May. I made haste to meet Mr. Grace, who arrived here the next day, and who remained a week, or more.—</p>
         <p>My “mate” detained me 12 days at one place—and, through travelling long before I ought I made it worse, insomuch that I thought it would end badly, and cost me a journey (or, voyage) to your town.—It has only <hi rend="italic">just</hi> healed—for which I am thankful.—</p>
         <p>About 10 days ago, Karaitiana, and a Mrs. Valentine Smith, suddenly appeared here. They came just in time: the weather, which, had been for 6 weeks remarkably fine, suddenly changing to wet which still continues.—</p>
         <p>During the last 9 days we have been <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> flooded—the first time severely so—garden, kitchen and back-rooms, deeply under water. Natives dogs, cats, &amp;c. &amp;c. in wakamahau and sitting room. Fortunately the river opened itself a new mouth, &amp; we received a benefit—water leaving, mud remaining. And <hi rend="italic">since</hi>, owing to the very heavy rain, we have been again, and are still, half submerged.—</p>
         <p>The Natives are rather clamorous about our immediate removal.—</p>
         <p>I feel myself in a strait.—</p>
         <p>All pretty quiet around: Hapuku at Te Waipukurau, erecting a house for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.</p>
         <p>Several deaths at Tangoio—among others the pakeha “Reino”—rather suddenly.</p>
         <p>Mr. Val. Smith has taken a part of Karaitiana’s house in the neighbouring <hi rend="italic">pa</hi>.</p>
         <p>You, who know our situation, &amp;c., can tell <hi rend="italic">all</hi> who may be strolling Ahuriri-wards—that any supply in the way of <hi rend="underline italic">kai</hi>, which the Station may afford, they shall ever be <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gladly</hi> welcome to: but <hi rend="italic">Lodgings</hi> and <hi rend="underline italic">Time</hi> I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for any one.</p>
         <p>It is well not to be disappointed.—</p>
         <p>Two days back I returned from Tangoio; and tomorrow I leave for a fortnight. When I rest another fortnight (i.e. cease travelling; rest is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> here)—September is wholly occupied, accordg. to arrangement:—ditto, October.—</p>
         <p>Yesterday we had <hi rend="italic">2 severe</hi> shocks of Earthq.—the first one, at ½ past 2 p.m., which made us all run out into the rain; I think this was the longest in duration that we have yet experienced. The second, happened at 20 m. past 9 p.m., and, both coming in one day, made us fear the worst.—</p>
         <p>2 vessels <hi rend="italic">in</hi> together from P.N.— “Phœbe” and “Twins” —several horses have arrived since you left.</p>
         <p>I think I shall be quite ready to buy a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> acres of land from the Govt.—immediately after you have settled with the Chiefs.—</p>
         <p>Mrs. Colenso is not, I am sorry to say, very well; owing to a severe cold. The Children are much as usual. The Kai-tuhituhi of this rheumatic, and going-out to get more so.—</p>
         <p>And so the wheel revolves.— </p>
         <p>Believe me, My dear Mr. McLean,</p>
         <p>Very sincerely yours, </p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I have lately heard (from Whites) of the Small Pox having arrived in N.Z., &amp; now committing fearful ravages at E. Cape. Pray get me some <hi rend="italic">vaccine virus</hi>, that I may do all I can for the infants and others here who are not vaccinated. I have at different times vaccinated a large number, but there are still hundreds who have not been done. If you can, pray get it from two sources; &amp; send immediate. It is a national good, &amp; one which I am willing to perform <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi>.                W.C.</p>
