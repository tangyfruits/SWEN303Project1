         <p>Norsewood, Octr. 31/84</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I duly recd. your kind note of 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. together w. copy of “N.Z.Times” sent w. it, and for it I thank you. Curiously enough I wrote to you about the same date, &amp; that, too, mainly on the same subject (N.Z. Lexicon) &amp; my man in going to P.O. to post it w. my other letters, (a job he daily does at 7.30 p.m.) brought me back yours! I was busy at the time writing to England &amp; preparing to leave for the “Bush”, so I put off answering, as well as the thoroughly reading the Art. in “Times” till I came here, knowing I should he sure to have my share of wet &amp; stormy days to confine me within doors; and such is the case today,—fine between showers, but S.W. wind desperately high—<hi rend="italic">a-la-Wellington</hi>!!</p>
         <p>And now to the “Times” and its Article. I could say—aye, &amp; write—a good deal about it, and (as I believe) completely refute it; but I have <hi rend="italic">long ago</hi> concluded it is not worth my while to do so. For (1.) <hi rend="italic">to me</hi> it is an article “made to order”, and written by some one who knows a <hi rend="italic">little </hi>of the Maori tongue,—or, who, being ignorant of it, has had <hi rend="italic">some </hi>information of that kind supplied him <hi rend="italic">for a special purpose</hi>: (2) the writer wholly ignores the long Parly. Paper (G.11) of 1875:<note xml:id="ftn3-268" place="foot" n="268"> Compilation of Maori Lexicon by Mr. Colenso (letters relative to). <hi rend="italic">Appendices to the Journals, House of Representatives</hi>, 1875, G11.</note>—or, knowing it, he wilfully sets it aside! as being unsuitable for his purpose: that Official Paper alone upsets much of what he has said: (3.) the “specimen pages” were copied in 1875 for D. McL. (then N.M.)<note xml:id="ftn3-269" place="foot" n="269"> Donald McLean (then Native Minister).</note> and placed by him on table of the House in that year, as the said Parly. Paper shows; but it was only at Xmas/82 (and then owing to the <hi rend="italic">repeated</hi> action previously made both private &amp; public by Capt. Russell, Mr. Ormond &amp; others, that I (at last) got Mr. Bryce to print them: (4.) Some 2–3 years ago I was attacked in an Auckld. Paper, &amp; also in Wn. “Times”, concerning the Mao. Lexicon; that in the “Times” was replied to by some (unknown) one there; while I wrote to Edr. of Auckland Paper, who declined to publish my letter, (though an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> subsr. from the beginning!) saying—“it was too long, &amp; that the subject was of no public interest”: subsequently I heard from one of the highest &amp; leading men in Auckd., who said—“that I ought to have known better than to find fault w. an Editor for his article <hi rend="italic">in his own paper</hi>”!!—–</p>
         <p>I have no doubt that my sending copies of that Parly. Paper to Locke &amp; to other members, &amp; also to the Governor, (at the time the question respecting the Mao. Lexn. was put to Ballance by Samuel,) to <hi rend="italic">show them the true position of things</hi>, has been a means of bringing out this article. I think, too, I could “spot” the writer—or informant;—who, also, says,—that “I neither knew Maori nor English”,—and, in all probability, <hi rend="italic">some will believe him</hi>! Capt. R., when here lately, told me a little about it, (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. the questioning &amp; answer in the House,) how they, the Members had been in error, &amp; how he had endeavoured to set them right, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I must have sent you, in ’75, or ’76, a copy of that Py. Paper; if you have it not handy, or would like another, I can send you one or two, w. pleasure: <hi rend="italic">be sure to let me know</hi>: <hi rend="italic">You </hi>should have it.</p>
         <p>I wish you had written me a longer letter (<hi rend="italic">not </hi>abt. Lexn.)—I wish to know something of yourself: what doing? how getting on? &amp;c, &amp;c. Moreover you had <hi rend="italic">promised</hi> to do so,—as, I think, I must have reminded you in my last. I am pretty (or, very) well; hope you &amp; yours are so. Have you been paying much attention to politics &amp; the “House” during Session? I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. Do you ever go to any of the Branch Institute’s Meetings? are you <hi rend="italic">still </hi>a member—<hi rend="italic">here</hi>, or there? Several here have resigned, &amp; many more will shortly—end of year.</p>
         <p>I have not been here since May (17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) &amp; shall remain here some time yet; hoping to return to this place again about Xmas. or Jany. 1: I greatly like this <hi rend="italic">extra quiet</hi>. I fear you may not get this early, as I am a long way from the village P.O.—With kind regards,</p>
         <p>Believe me, yours truly,     W. Colenso.</p>
