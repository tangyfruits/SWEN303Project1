         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Being in town today I made some enquiry about the “Posters”. From what little I could learn, I find, that Mr. Morrison the Watchmaker ordered them (through, I presume, your “Agent”, Hooper) and that he considers himself responsible, and that he should have paid for them long ago if you had sent to him the acct. He will pay you for them.—</p>
         <p>Perhaps you will permit me to remark that I think the charge of ₤1.—much too high. Could you <hi rend="italic">not</hi> lessen it to him? You may recollect that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> sent my advertisements to all 3 Daily Papers (at that time) when <hi rend="italic">one</hi> would have answered, as well. I merely make the remark now, as I have from time to time, heard it remarked the very high prices <hi rend="italic">here</hi> for advertising etc. unless one haggles beforehand. </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">And</hi> there is a great difference between Posters and Posters i.e. as to their being desired, lucrative, or advantageous.</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. I think I may go inland tomorrow—but I will send the Bal. some <hi rend="italic">early day</hi> by your son. </p>
         <p>I have heard it remarked (and I was gratified in hearing it) of the proper way <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had noticed the execution of Kereopa.</p>
