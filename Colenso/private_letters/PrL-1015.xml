         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>October 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1897.</p>
         <p>Dear William</p>
         <p>I duly received your kind letter of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst., I thank you for remembering me, seeing, too, you and your Father are so busy, I am glad to hear of you—<hi rend="italic">all</hi>—being so well in health, and hope you have, at last, <hi rend="italic">finer </hi>spring weather: here, the weather has on the whole been good of late, but very changeable: nights and early mornings often cloudy, but on two mornings of last week I had a good sight of <hi rend="italic">our </hi>star (or, better, planet) Venus, at IV.15;—this always serves to remind me of you, and of Dannevirke. I did hope to pay your town a short visit during this month, (and so I wrote recently to Pawson the Secretary Fire Brigade,) but have, at last, put off my doing so until <hi rend="italic">after </hi>the middle of next month, because our Bishop is expected to return from England on the first November, and the annual meeting of the Synod is called for the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,—and this I suppose will occupy a week. And also, by that time, I hope to have regained more strength in my legs for walking,—they are still weak for out-of-doors exercise: I have been only 3 times to town since I returned to Napier on 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. July, but I must go thither this week on business, of course, to and from, in trap from door. I am pretty well in general health, arm and hand not yet come round to old usual practice, (perhaps never may,) I have, however, much to be thankful for. You tell me of a “Young Men’s Temperance Union, started by the women of Dannevirke”,—I trust it will prove to be in accordance with its name, and not (<hi rend="italic">as too many of them are</hi>) Intemperate and Lying: it is <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, that really keeps down <hi rend="italic">true Temperance </hi>among us: Keep, dear William, to Scripture and to Reason (truth), and your new club should do well.</p>
         <p>I have heard, from all quarters, of the “Going ahead” of Dannevirke—particularly in building, and in water laid on,—and hope she will continue to do so: only keeping a good “look-out,” to have <hi rend="italic">strong roots downward </hi>as well as fine fresh leaves and flowers upward. I note what you say about the people <hi rend="italic">not </hi>keeping Friday 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Septr. (the great holiday at Norsewood.) I received Invitations to be there, &amp; should have liked to be with them, but was <hi rend="italic">not strong enough to go. </hi>Here am I, in the midst of my “Bush”! with trees and shrubs flowering &amp; rejoicing (in their natural way) all around me: and seeing them doing so well, I, too, endeavour to join them, and am cheerful with them. Good bye, Dear Wm. Kindly remember me to your Parents and all the family.</p>
         <p>I am, Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
