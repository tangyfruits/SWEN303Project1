         <p rend="end">Napier, March 30, 1865.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>It seems as if our letters were destined to cross! Since my last to you I have received your two kind notes of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. &amp; 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst., for which I have to thank you. From your last I find you have been so near me as Wellington, and by this time I suppose you are safely returned again to Dunedin, and will have received my last to you of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst., with the “<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>”, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>There are just one or two matters in your two letters which require answering.— 1. with reference to Shortland’s essay: you say,— “the Commissrs. may wish to have <hi rend="italic">both</hi> published, to which I suppose you can have no objection”.—To this I reply, <hi rend="italic">Certainly not</hi>; do as you please in the matter.— 2. with reference to my accepting remuneration, (and which you approve of,) I should perhaps tell you, that I agreed to do so, just because time to me is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> valuable than money, and (in this case) I have been actually obliged (as it were) to pay—or allow—for time. In January 1864, I arranged with the Genl. Govt. to write certain Anglo-Maori School Books, &amp;c, for a certain sum, to be finished by Jany. 1866.—Before, however, I left Auckland in Decr. last, I got Mr. Weld to extend the <hi rend="italic">time </hi>6 months longer (but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the pay,) and this I was obliged to do, because I had already then given you so much time, &amp; <hi rend="italic">had further agreed to write Essay No. 2.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>—3. I have little doubt but that had I had more time allowed to write Essay No.2, I could have further strengthened my positions therein taken. Already several things have occurred to me which are new. I have also, since I sent the sd. essay, read “Lyell’s Antiquity of Man,” and my good Cousin’s (<hi rend="italic">Natal</hi>) part <hi rend="italic">iv. </hi>on the Pentateuch: and am not a little pleased with much I found in both works—especially with the copious quotations in the latter from “Nott’s Types of Mankind”, (for which work I have just written to England,) and from Prof. “Owen’s Addresses”—which I had not before seen or heard of. A few of my select acquaintances here, who know of my having written Essay No. 2, and of the very <hi rend="italic">short time </hi>allowed me for doing so, are of opinion I should add a short Postscript to that effect, which I think, with your permission (especially if you print Shortland’s) I shall do. If there should be a demand for mine hereafter in a separate form, perhaps the Commee. would no objection to my adding to it, &amp; further improving it for a second (and separate) edition?</p>
         <p>4. About the <hi rend="italic">Bell</hi>: You tell me that your “Chief Surveyor recognizes the inscription as <hi rend="italic">Tamul</hi>, and that he wishes to obtain a Copy to send to Logan at Singapore”:—<hi rend="italic">by all means let him do so</hi>. (If a photograph however should be taken, please let me have one for Dr. Hooker.—The Commissrs. are also <hi rend="italic">quite welcome</hi> to take a photog. of it, or of its Inscription, for their Catalogue—if they approve of it,—or, indeed, of any thing else of mine in the Exhibition.)—I doubt however the Inscription proving to be <hi rend="italic">Tamul</hi>. I have the Tamul Characters, Malayalim, and Cingalese,—and have often compared them all, but have failed in identifying them. At the same time 2 or 3 of the chars. on the Bell do come very near to 2 or 3 of the Tamul chars.—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> to the short <hi rend="italic">w</hi>—the initial <hi rend="italic">va</hi>,—and the final <hi rend="italic">na</hi>. I earnestly hope the Inscription may contain its <hi rend="italic">date</hi>. On referring again to your letter, I find you say,—Your C. Surveyor “<hi rend="italic">can decypher it</hi>”:—what then does he make of it? You did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> (in any former letter to hand) tell me of its being Tamul, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>5. Be assured, <hi rend="italic">I greatly regret not being really </hi>able to visit your Exhibition. I should very much like to see it, and indeed to spend some time in studying many portions of it. Seeing you have had but a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> season,—could you not keep it together (mainly) <hi rend="italic">for another summer</hi>? even if you had to shut it up for the winter.—This thought has often occurred to me of late.</p>
         <p>I shall be very happy to receive a “proof” of the Essay. I hope your Printer will have a clever and careful <hi rend="italic">Reader</hi>: I am sure I have written all (especially any foreign language) very plain, so as to provide against typographical errors which I hate. I hear from our Mr. Wilkinson that he had the pleasure of seeing you at Wellington.        Believe me, my dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours very faithfully,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
