         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>October 15/68.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have to thank you for yours of 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ult. (received here on 3oth.)—and should have done so ere this, but for violent cold &amp; irregularity (or paucity) of known Mail conveyance to Wellington.</p>
         <p>As to the said “<hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>”—</p>
         <p>If thought worthy of a place in the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. vol. of your “Institute Transactions”—as you propose—I can have no objection. Only it is more of a sketch—outline—or pamphlet kind, than usually obtains in papers for such a volume. I trust you will be sure to <hi rend="italic">add</hi> the short <hi rend="italic">P.S. </hi>I wrote (of some 8–10 lines) to it, as, if more time had been allowed me, (or, if it were <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to be done,) I should, on not a few heads, have written more fully and <hi rend="italic">decidedly</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Also, I should very much prefer the <hi rend="italic">omission </hi>of “Esq” and “M.G.A.” (after my name) on title page.</p>
         <p>And don’t forget me with a few (say 50) Copies <hi rend="italic">extra</hi>—<hi rend="underline italic">which I will pay for</hi>—or shall <hi rend="italic">I </hi>write to the Govt. Printer about it?</p>
         <p>You say— “If the Governor sanctions it you may purpose bringing out <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the essays in the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. vol.”—Do you include those <hi rend="italic">already printed</hi>? If so, my dear Sir, please let me know; as there are some 8–10 little errors in my ptd. Botl. one, which I have marked, &amp; would send them to you.—also, in this case, to leave out “Esq” &amp;c.—Besides it would <hi rend="italic">look </hi>much better (if not really read clearer) if the several Botl. <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> were put in lines.—(I will <hi rend="italic">clearly</hi> point this out, when I hear from you, that it is your intention to print the whole of the said Essays.)</p>
         <p>I know nothing of what has been doing with you (in the Houses) since Ormond’s return: I sincerely hope <hi rend="italic">your</hi> “<hi rend="italic">Vote</hi>” is secure. Surely little enough is done for <hi rend="italic">science</hi> by our practical utilitarians. I know not how it may go with the <hi rend="italic">Dicty</hi>. vote (whatever that may be). I had committed it to Ormond (who <hi rend="italic">has</hi> returned) and to McLean (and he too is returning—for what I know now on his way)! Had I not done so I think I should have troubled Mantell or Domett. Did you see any of the official Letters I have been <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to write about it? Ormond told me they (or some of them) were laid on the Table.—</p>
         <p>You ask me, if I could send some Papers for your Institute? I don’t know what I might not be tempted to do if I were <hi rend="italic">free</hi>, but as it is, alas! I am bound hard &amp; fast in my <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> job:—which however I daily <hi rend="italic">augment</hi>, &amp; yet daily <hi rend="italic">lessen</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I have no doubt but that I shall be greatly pleased with your papers—when published: I <hi rend="italic">envy</hi> Wellington on account of its Institute, Museum, Geolog. Corps, and Library. May she <hi rend="italic">know </hi>her good day—Believe me</p>
         <p>Very sincerely yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
