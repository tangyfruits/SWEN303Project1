         <p rend="end">Tavistock Hotel,<lb/>Waipukurau.<lb/>Sunday, March 24/78.</p>
         <p>A. Luff Esq., </p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">You </hi>will <hi rend="italic">not </hi>wonder at my being <hi rend="italic">here, </hi>neither will <hi rend="italic">you</hi> require being told the lat. &amp; long. of <hi rend="italic">this </hi>place. You may however wonder at some portion of this letter.</p>
         <p>Your long &amp; kind letter of the 30th. Jany. I recd. before I left town, &amp; knowing that I could not return in time, I brought it with me. First (as you rightly say) to <hi rend="italic">business </hi>though unprofitable to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>! I have to thank you for all you have done re Linn. Socys. pubs., but I must allow all to stand over until next mail (for many reasons). I have also had a letter from Dixon &amp; Co., of which more anon,—I cannot reply by this mail. I wrote to Wesley, (Essex Street, Strand) by last mail, remitting him £20 (£15 bal. &amp; £5 to credit). I had then hoped to write more fully by this, but I cannot. I will thank you to let him know from me, that if he has <hi rend="italic">not </hi>sent the books I ordered (Perowne on the Psalms) <hi rend="italic">not to do so</hi> until he again hears from me, as <hi rend="italic">all</hi> books may shortly be sent off together, &amp; so save expenses. If, however, he has sent me that work (as I had requested) all right.</p>
         <p>Now I have a bit of news re myself: in my last I told you of my <hi rend="italic">increased</hi> salary—now I have <hi rend="italic">none</hi>! having resigned my office. I have been treated ill by my old acquaintance &amp; professed “friends”, (Rhodes, Ormond &amp; Lee,)—as the Board, (acting at a sub-meeting &amp; in the absence of Chambers a Newton) &amp; as it was the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. time within a few weeks &amp; directly against my official letter to them of Feby., and opposed to all principle—I saw I had no alternative, acting honourably. O. &amp; others have since tried hard w. me to withdraw my Resign. but I can’t do it, the B, too making no concession. Of course I shall <hi rend="italic">feel </hi>the loss of £300 per annum &amp; also the faces of the many dear children, &amp; shall (for a time) be more lonely than ever. Were I in N. I cd. tell you a deal, which I cannot here; possibly I may write to you more anent this by the next Mail. I would it had happened <hi rend="italic">last</hi> year, then, I, too, might have <hi rend="italic">migrated</hi>!</p>
         <p>I put up a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> papers for you before I left town, &amp; I now add 2 more from this place. In one of the Auckd. papers I send you will find my letter defending Bp. W. &amp; <hi rend="italic">his </hi>
            <hi rend="underline">Dicty</hi>.<note xml:id="ftn2-317" place="foot" n="317">
               <hi rend="italic">New Zealand Herald</hi> 7 March 1878.</note> I should tell you that our two Town papers (under the infl. of the Board) are trying quietly to keep down or out the pretty general feeling respecting me. I recd. a very <hi rend="italic">nice</hi> letter from Reardon before I left Town, begging me to reconsider or withdraw my Resign. and now I see (in D.T. of last evg.) that <hi rend="italic">he </hi>has resigned <hi rend="italic">his </hi>office:—can he be thinking of <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>? (A little bird (in authority) told me that Carlile had long sought it! asked for it!!) I had nearly 20 applications for the sitn. of servants: I have chosen a man &amp; his wife named <hi rend="italic">Arnold</hi>, been here about 5 years; man was w. Witty (who highly recommends him) wife was w. Johnston, Baker, who highly recommends her: for last 12-15 months both have lived w. Lascelles, whom they leave to come to W.C.</p>
         <p>Gollan, Wellwood, W. Marshall—all gone! &amp; it is whispered J. Chambers is going too. I have not been attending to my own business of late, being far too busy; soon I suppose I shall have more time for mine &amp; <hi rend="italic">thine</hi>. After this month something will have to be done w. Sladen, A. Mackay, P.D., &amp; <hi rend="italic">others</hi>. (L. &amp; I. are waiting).</p>
         <p>I told Fannin (I knew he wd. tell Ormond) that I had held 2 fair offices under Govt., Treasr. &amp; Inspector; &amp; lost <hi rend="italic">Both</hi> at a moment’s warning (or without any,)—through my pol. friends (!!) &amp; neighbours—McL. &amp; J.D.O.,—and salary too, same. Of course, I shall never take any office again. I would that I had £200 a year <hi rend="italic">more</hi> then I can (at present) raise. F. is now living in Thomas’ house, I told him a few days ago that I felt sure if he did not <hi rend="italic">reform</hi> he wd. lose his billets; poor fellow, he felt it &amp; cried bitterly. You (although used to “Returns”) would be astonished at what I have had to execute for both Ed. Board, &amp; Govt. Edn. Department. Had the clause in Edn. Act stood as the (late) Govt. drafted it, viz., Inspectors under Govt. &amp; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Boards—I had never resigned.</p>
         <p>Did you know Charley Mackey who was Purvis Russell’s gardener? he lately died, after a short illness. I have sent you Newman’s plans—Town &amp; Country lands! I fear a few will be taken in. Note <hi rend="italic">his </hi>names of Streets.</p>
         <p>Grubb was well when I left; he always <hi rend="italic">promises </hi>but <hi rend="italic">never</hi> comes to see me! I miss <hi rend="italic">your friendly</hi> visits much. I almost fancy the <hi rend="italic">big </hi>wedding that was to have come off here is knocked on the head. Drover has a large house building for himself. Branch Bank of N.Z. is to be opened here; &amp; a good road is made connecting terrace w. the lower street—just central;— Messrs. Herbert, &amp; Smith giving each one half. I cannot write you any more, I have done this uneasily (in my bedroom on a chest o’ drawers). I have enjoyed very good health during this month—though overworked. Last week I walked several miles a day, to-&amp;-fro in <hi rend="italic">40</hi>m. Bush: tomorrow I am off again.</p>
         <p>So good-bye; hope you are all quite well. And with kindest regards,</p>
         <p>Believe me ever</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
