         <p>Mr J. Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Two letters from you since my last, stir me up to write in re­ply. Although I do <hi rend="italic">not feel</hi> adequate to the task of replying, as <hi rend="italic">I ought to do</hi>, yet as your mail leaves us in the morning, I have no alternative, and—I do not like putting it off—and I may tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> right off, at once, that I have been working a little too hard of <hi rend="italic">late</hi> (Sundays and Mondays, day &amp; night)—in preparing for our <hi rend="italic">last</hi> nights meeting (the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, too, for this session),—I did not leave the Athenæum building till past XI last night,—&amp; it was nearly 2 this mng. when I went to bed; up at VII, &amp; have been in town all this mg on various affairs,—and I have not yet found time to open my English letters, from sons, brothers, Sisters, &amp; others, (which arrived yesterday), but hope to do so this evening.—Last night I was very busy, no helper;—I will send you with this a “D.T.” of this eve­ning, from which you will find that I made use of <hi rend="italic">your</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">insect</hi> specimens.</p>
         <p>But I must return to your letters;—<hi rend="italic">Thanks</hi> for your kind and sympathetic remarks re Self &amp; Ed. H.B. Herald; others (both town &amp; Country) have told me much the same, and as some of them were <hi rend="italic">old</hi> &amp; valued friends, Your making spontaneously a very similar remark pleased me much.</p>
         <p>I returned from “70 Mile Bush” on last evening of October, having had enough of it; (6 days rain &amp; hail) &amp; <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> Sy winds there out of 7; and a small apartment, &amp; a very smoky chimney!!). I got 3 severe <hi rend="italic">drenchings</hi>, and brought back with me a dreadful cold, from which I am only just now­ recovering; I staid 3-4 days at Gows, on my way back, and thought I might then &amp; there, have heard from you.—</p>
         <p>The Book you mention by Mr Roberts of Birmingham, I have not seen, but I have little doubt I have seen plenty of other <hi rend="italic">similar</hi> ones, and have several such here in my library. Of course, as I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> seen it, I cannot give you any opinion upon it; if you should have time to spare, &amp;c, &amp; would write me out a few questions (briefly) concerning anything very striking (to you) that he says, I might be able to reply;—­</p>
         <p>I think, that, speaking truthfully, I should be obliged to agree with you, in your closing remark, viz. “If Roberts is right, most of the Minis­ters are <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>” of this (latter part) I have long had no doubt at all; they are, individually Ministers of parties—sects—“Churches” if you will,—and it is the Creed, or peculiar teachings, of their own party that they wish &amp; seek to establish &amp; advance. Let the question be asked seriously,—With which of them would Jesus of Nazareth associate, were he now to appear? I say (generally) with <hi rend="italic">none</hi>. Nor would they—one­ &amp; all—receive him, if he should come again as he once appeared in Judea, a poor young carpenter; an opposer of` long established habits &amp; beliefs &amp; customs. The same Pharisaic spirit is still at work, (maybe stronger &amp; more bitter than ever;)—and the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> evil tree can only bear the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> kind of evil fruit,</p>
         <p>For holding, and (privately) teaching this, I have suffered a good deal,—and <hi rend="italic">am</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">now</hi> enduring, &amp; shall to the end. I have often thought, (especially of late years) how much I, an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> man, of some experience &amp; knowledge, &amp; study in those matters,—how I should like to speak a few (or many) words in public—(preach, if you will) on those great &amp; impor­tant matters you have referred to. Those thoughts are over strong on me, when in the forest, &amp;c, inland; <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is the place to worship God; to com­mune with Him, through His Works;—but I must stop this,—which you, by your faithful &amp; thoughtful remark, have drawn out from me, as it were, I have a great mind to destroy <hi rend="italic">this page</hi>—but I won’t; you shall have it, only, my young friend, let me say one more thing <hi rend="italic">to you</hi> (as I think we understand each other, being both seekers after <hi rend="smallcaps italic">truth</hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> ) do you put to me any question you please, concerning anything that may be working in your mind, whether “temporal or spiritual” (as they say) and I will do my best to reply.­—</p>
         <p>As you may well suppose, I found a rare <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> of letters here awai­ting me, from England and elsewhere, on my return from the “Bush”, and one of the best among them, was from Rev R Fraser, late of Waipu­kurau (I mention this, as you must know him well,—he is a good man, (though of course, a Presbeterian Minister,—still a Scholar—which is more than many of that ilk)—he was also a dear friend of mine; one of those <hi rend="italic">few</hi> men one meets with now-a-days,—who, you can see at a glance <hi rend="italic">likes</hi> to meet with you, &amp; talk <hi rend="italic">freely</hi> with you.</p>
         <p>And now for your <hi rend="italic">second</hi> letter, Nov “13” (which I fancy, should have been “12”, and indeed I received it on Saturday night,) that &amp; box of insects came to hand alright. I showed 2 of your new insects last night—the grey fellows with a long trunk;—(I had some last year <hi rend="italic">Rhyncodes</hi> they are called) one, bigger still; a fine fellow, from Weber, this and another I described in a paper which went late to Wel­lington, and was therefore not in time for Vol XIII,—I do not know if their rules will allow of its being published in this years volume. I also showed 2 of your former insects, one with a long black snout, a species of <hi rend="italic">Brentus</hi> I think, unfortunately its horns were both bro­ken, in part, &amp; among insects a very great deal depends on their horns—their no of joints, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I am thinking of again going to the “Bush” next week; there to spend a few days; and I also have a great desire to spend a little time with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—perhaps in the Autumn—when <hi rend="italic">we</hi> might <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> a while.</p>
         <p>I was pleased to hear of your <hi rend="italic">all</hi> being well. I suppose namesake is growing away a fine fellow, both Mothers and Fathers delight; a light <hi rend="italic">in the house</hi>, in darkish days or hours;—with much love to your son, kind regards, Believe me, my Dear Sir, yours truly,</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso.</p>
