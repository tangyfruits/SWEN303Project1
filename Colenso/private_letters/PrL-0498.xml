         <p rend="end">Napier Wednesday night<lb/>Apl 19/82</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Last night I received yours of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, with little box, &amp; thank you for all. Your mail leaves tomorrow, &amp; I hope to leave on Friday, so write now, &amp; as I purpose being absent a full fortnight, or more, I think you will not hear from me for <hi rend="italic">some time</hi>; for, when I return, our <hi rend="italic">First</hi> May Meeting will absorb all my time,—if indeed, it comes off. Write, as much as you please in the meanwhile, but do not <hi rend="italic">send</hi> any <hi rend="italic">living</hi> spns, &amp;c, until you know of my return.</p>
         <p>Now to your letter. The little plant you enclose is one of our smaller <hi rend="italic">Epilobiums</hi>, Of this genus there are several known spns in N.Z. The smaller ones run into one another terribly!. The peculiar little dots on the under­side of the leaves is a small parasitical <hi rend="italic">fungus</hi> of the Nidulariacei Tribe. There are several spns (or vars) in N.Z, all of them curious objects,a beau­tiful one is found on the <hi rend="italic">flowering</hi> stems of the large <hi rend="italic">Clematis</hi>.</p>
         <p>Your little snail, in its big box, has interested me much. Thirty–forty years ago I made a good collection of our N.Z. snails; there are more than 20, perhaps 40, known &amp; described sorts, but they are all mostly scarce, or not commonly found. This one I have had walking about here this morning, &amp; I have been admiring it, although the morning was much too gloomy with rain to examine anything <hi rend="italic">clearly</hi>; at present I <hi rend="italic">do not know</hi> if this is a new kind, or not; It may be a <hi rend="italic">young</hi> one, &amp; I think it is, but I have no doubt of there being <hi rend="italic">more</hi> where this was found. Let your little son (dear little fellow) look them up, with his sharp <hi rend="italic">een</hi>; &amp; handle them <hi rend="italic">gently</hi> &amp; keep in damp Moss. More anon.</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi>. I do not think you will find this sort of <hi rend="italic">Moss</hi> growing among the “Black Scrub”, (unless there are old water-holes, or very damp spots there,)—I fancy I know the fine white branching <hi rend="italic">Lichen</hi>, you have in your eye, which grows among the Bk Scrub.</p>
         <p>I was in town this afternoon, first time since Saturday, &amp; was sorry to hear of the death of McCormick, Steam Cos agent at the Port. I have been as busy as a bee, or rather, a hen with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> chick, making more noise than work;—in writing largely to England, &amp;c. At present I purpose going to Matamau, near Danevirk.</p>
         <p>I had no idea you had such a big bonnie ha’ up there; well may Mr Kinross &amp; others incline toward the pure mountain air of Glenross. Well, goodbye. Work away and <hi rend="italic">admire</hi> the works of God in Creation.</p>
         <p>With kind regards</p>
         <p>Yours very truly </p>
         <p>             W.Colenso</p>
      </body>
