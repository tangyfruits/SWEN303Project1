         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand,<lb/>June 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. 1875.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Where are you <hi rend="italic">now</hi>? &amp; <hi rend="italic">how</hi>? are questions I would greatly like to have answered, &amp; that satisfactorily. It is now 116 days (according to my reckoning) since you left our shores, &amp; we have not yet heard any thing of your ship! Grubb &amp; myself have been rather anxious of late:—I wrote to him yesterday, saying, that I would wait till the 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., when, if we heard nothing, I should telegraph to Shipping Office at Dunedin:—I fear, however, they have not yet got any news. Several of our ships <hi rend="italic">from</hi> England have been making long passages lately: “John Norman” to this port is now 143 days out! but the “Merope,” which you saw at Lyttleton, (Willie’s ship,) had a good passage home. Willie, too, should be now <hi rend="italic">nearing</hi> England—this being their 88 day,—but yours much longer.</p>
         <p>The lately received <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> news of the “Schiller”—following so closely on that of the “Cospatrick”—has made us more than usually anxious about you—but we must continue to hope &amp; to trust in <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>.—</p>
         <p>My last to you was on 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. May—which, with Papers then sent, I hope you may duly receive. In that I told you of the Election,—that has come off and I was <hi rend="italic">beaten</hi>: shamefully so, I may say, when the <hi rend="italic">number</hi> of the Town who voted for me is considered: 10 for Lee (he could not get one more!—this is known,)—&amp; 15 for C., of this 15, I got 5, of whom 4 were from <hi rend="italic">Country</hi>, viz. Chambers, W.Couper, Dolbel, Grinvell from Wellington (who landed in a gale in the new Life boat!) &amp; poor old Wiggins, who was brought on Crutches from Hospital: so that only 10, of the Town proper, moved out of their seats to vote for me! I was <hi rend="italic">assured</hi> by a Govt. <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> that 35 had promised, or pledged, &amp; that I was quite safe: his 35, did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> include my promises,—or Robjohns (of whom <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was doubtful) but who <hi rend="italic">did</hi> vote for me. <hi rend="italic">Afterwards </hi>there was a little commotion about it: “Who could have thought it!” &amp;c &amp;c and a few have apologised to me for not voting—saying , they had been assured I should get in flying, &amp;c, &amp;c. Some of the old, good, settlers (as Chambers, W. Couper, Robjohns, &amp; others) are vexed, &amp; wondering at it. Of course, Lee is (or was) exultant! I have said Good-bye! for ever now, to all Elections here. It is <hi rend="italic">rumoured</hi>, that the Methodist <hi rend="italic">bodies</hi> turned against me at the last moment, owing to my not fully fraternising with them, &amp; to my opposing <hi rend="italic">Denominational </hi>Schools. I have written <hi rend="italic">largely to </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi>: but it is all over now!—</p>
         <p>Others, however, of us, <hi rend="italic">old </hi>hands, got a worse beating: Lambert was ousted by Rechab Harding!! who got in on G. Templar Rechabite &amp; Methodist votes. Tiffen was beaten by R. Stuart, &amp; was very wrathful about it; Newton was (unexpectedly) beaten by J.A. Smith (Tiffen, I believe, did this in revenge—as, no doubt, Newton, Lyndon, Tuxford, &amp; others, sold T.)—&amp; Newton, too, was <hi rend="italic">very </hi>vexed.—I voted for him, &amp; expected he would be returned. But, notably, Buchanan was out-&amp;-out sold, beaten dreadfully by <hi rend="italic">Bennett</hi>,—Road-overseer!! “Oh! what a fall was there, my Country men!” When the 6 Maori votes—(who all voted for Buchan) &amp; his own &amp; his son’s v. are deducted, he could only have had a <hi rend="italic">very few</hi> at Clive—notwithstanding his bragging, some (J.A. Smith, Knowles, Sutton, &amp; others) went out from <hi rend="italic">here</hi> to vote for him, Buchanan. Herrick is in for Bridges seat: Dolbel, again for Mohaka; Towgood, Petane: Burton, Wairoa, Laurence (W.R. Harding) for Te Aute; I expect Lambert is <hi rend="italic">sulky</hi>. Tiffen &amp; wife are off directly for America. The new Council will have <hi rend="italic">10 new</hi>, &amp; 10 old hands: we shall see how they will get on together. I think it a very good thing that Buchanan is <hi rend="italic">out</hi>: and it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> prove to be a <hi rend="italic">really good </hi>thing that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am out—as now I have one less tye in this place; &amp; have been thinking <hi rend="italic">largely</hi>, since, about returning to England; even to proposing to O. to resign Inspr. of Schools—which he won’t hear of, but which will, I think, surely come to pass.—</p>
         <p>Weather continued fine until <hi rend="italic">last</hi> week in May—when winter set in. This has been a gloomy day—cold wet: <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> atmosphere: a huge amount of snow on Ruahine—all fell in a few days last week! The great sickness still continues—<hi rend="italic">lots</hi> of folks sick (mostly children &amp; young) w. Low Fever; no abatement yet; my own man down—3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. week, &amp; but very slowly bettering. I told his poor wife to confine her attention to him (it being so Infectious, too,)—so there has been but little of Home comfort in this <hi rend="italic">lonely </hi>house.</p>
         <p>Sheehan (for Natives) has put J.D. Canning’s big Porangahau Run into the market; C. has got one, a principal owner, to repudiate it: more work for the Lawyers. Sheehan (for Karaitiana) has thrown up Awanga land: K. Hill is again applying. H.R.R. has put the Hampden Land into the market. Knight is prosecuting Miller, Stock Agent, who got out an Execution against all K’s. landed property. Some ₤6000. <hi rend="italic">is to be</hi> spent in getting 2 artesian wells, &amp; a huge tank up near Sealy’s—this by Munl. Council!—Lee, for Price (D.T.) has threatened D.M. &amp; Co. w. prosecution for Libel: H. published the letter!—</p>
         <p>I am tolerably well,—&amp; pretty free from Rheumatism, but I must be careful,—not ½ my schools have been visited, yet, owing to the general sickness!—Many buildings are at a stand for timber. Where Marten kept an Eating house, a <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> Drapery establishment is to be, lighted from roof, &amp; extra large windows. New Bank, where Sim lived, next to Abrahams, a neat Building.—I have gone occasionally to Criterion to lunch (for dinner)—&amp; Johnson, Baker, has sent me some cold boiled meat &amp; Bread,—but such, <hi rend="italic">in the winter</hi>, is not very nice, day after day. I am glad that Willie is away. Caldwell, Baker at Havelock, is dead from it,—also Kelly, a gardener, at Taradale, &amp; <hi rend="italic">several</hi> others—young folks. No Doctor has gone for a <hi rend="italic">long time</hi> out of town—not to Clive, nor Havelock, nor to Meeanee—they are worn out, or nearly so! I dread this fever—&amp; with reason—30 years ago, this season, I was attacked at Waitangi, &amp; nearly died—I was very bad, &amp; no human aid, delirious, &amp; all that,—I well <hi rend="italic">remember </hi>the fearful hideous sights I saw in my delirious state, and oh! I was a long &amp; <hi rend="italic">weary</hi> time in getting roused. Often have I held by the old fence there, &amp; <hi rend="italic">cried</hi>, &amp; wished for death!—Many Natives had it then, &amp; many died from it.—Newton’s eldest son is slowly getting better. Moggridge’s family are all down,—&amp; others on the opposite hill. I dread the arrival of any Immigrants, as I fear many of them will be doomed! I never knew such a sad time here in Napier.—</p>
         <p>Tuke, &amp; K. McLean, seem to have a deal to do as <hi rend="italic">auctioneers</hi>; but all have <hi rend="italic">work</hi>. T.O. Williams is about to cut up his Suburban Sns. end of Shakespeare Rd. Prendergast is here, in <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Ct. Ho., holding Court,—Trestrail v. Giffard to day, but see the Papers I send. I fear my letter &amp; papers to you in our <hi rend="italic">March</hi> Mail were lost in “Schiller”. Sir Donald had the gout, &amp; retreated to Hastings,—he is now better, &amp; goes <hi rend="italic">today</hi> per “Luna” to Wgn.—It is said, <hi rend="italic">he </hi>must <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> in the House! unless Stafford can be got to join. Sheehan is <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, having resigned his Off. as Provl. Secy. at Auckland; Heretaunga cases are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, I hear, coming off this Court.</p>
         <p>And now I must once more say Good bye! I hope you are safe &amp; well <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of you in England before this—      Believe me ever,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p rend="end">Friday, June 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.<lb/>4 p.m.</p>
         <p>P.S. I must now close, no news yet of your Ship, a steamer arrived at Bluff bringing London telegrams to 26 May. In the second trial, this day, Giffard v. Trestrail, for trespass, &amp;c—Giffard won, Damages (I believe) ₤350. (T. gained the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> trial yesterday—I have posted the Paper to you)—pity they did not settle it out of Court—<hi rend="underline italic">Law exp. heavy</hi>.</p>
         <p>This day is a delightfully fine one. Luna has remained to take the Mail in mg.</p>
         <p>Hope you &amp; yours are well &amp; safe, &amp; that we may soon hear of your being so. Fare well.</p>
         <p>             w.<hi rend="italic">Best</hi> wishes</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                             W. Colenso.</p>
