         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Hawke’s Bay, N. Zealand<lb/>September 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1850.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I once knew an old lady in Cornwall, who used continually to be saying, “My dear Child, it cant be helped, you are born under a malignant planet!” Now it is not to profess to you <hi rend="italic">my </hi>belief in astrology that I preface my letter with the foregoing sentence, but merely to give you my own opinion of our unlucky correspondence, or rather, of that share of it which falls to myself. I have now before me <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of your kind letters, dated, respectively, 5 Sepr./48, and 26 Augt./49, which, with Copies of the Tasmanian Journal, and a Letter from Mr. Gell (dated April 13/47!), reached me together on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Jany. last. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> was a time of unusual bustle—I should rather say, <hi rend="italic">trial</hi>—(a sad state of things which lasted some time, during which my life &amp; property were in continual danger, being hourly threatened by a large body of the Natives living about me, who, finally, siezed my person and carrying me off, bruised me much,—the sole cause, my putting down a Native Teacher who was unfit for his office!) during this time of trial, I was obliged to write to the Lt.-Govr., to inform him of my situation. And though I despatched a special messenger with my Letter, early in February an answer thereto only reached us here 4 days back—on the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. ult.! Mrs Colenso’s <hi rend="italic">sister</hi> was married at Auckland in March last, and, although the news was quickly despatched, we have only <hi rend="italic">now </hi>received it! From my good Correspondent the Parson of Wellington, I have only heard once during this year—i.e. on the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. ult.—And all this I write that you may the better comprehend my isolated &amp; out-of-the-world situation. For, alas! now-a-days, in these unique times, when every one not only grasps Time by the forelock, but actually leaves him a long way astern—thanks to the march of intellect—the Steam—the railways—the Montgolfiers<note xml:id="ftn1-133" place="foot" n="133"> The Montgolfier brothers first flew a hot air balloon in 1783.</note>—and the electric-lightning-winged posts—I fear you will be half tempted to think, that I am trespassing upon your credulity, did I not thus bring forward a few such plain facts, and thrust them into your witness-box. And then again (for I have not yet done,) I have not been to Wellington since I last wrote you there; and, of our 4 little trading-vessels—one foundered with all hands, and a second went to pieces at Cape Turnagain, in the winter of /49, while the third, too surely following in the wake of her sisters, also foundered, with all her crew, in the beginning of this present winter; by which, too, I lost (as I now find) all my Letters and Papers, &amp;c., which had been quietly accumulating for me at Wellington! And, though I might give you some more, of the chapter of accidents and disagreeables, I will even now stop—or, I shall fill my sheet with anything but pleasant information. Now, is it at all unreasonable for me to think upon the exclamation of the old Cornish Lady? Seeing, too, that little wee things often lead one’s mind to a most heterogenous association of bulky ideas. I just now carefully looked out at my window, and, on beholding the snow still lying on the mountains, I thought on Humboldt on Chimborazo; while the keen “Southerly” which has been blowing all day, with its usual accompaniments of blackness and darkness &amp; cold, immediately took me to Ross’ huge Antarctic Barrier of Ice, and the fearful collision of his two ships—a mental scene, at which my mind instinctively shudders.—</p>
         <p>But I must rein in my wandering imagination, and endeavour to begin to write something that may, (through your kindness) pass for a Letter. But first I must thank you (which I see I have not yet done), for your two kind Letters and their Companions. And now, what shall I tell you in our way? Why, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, that I have been doing what I can during this past winter, in putting up plants—Marine &amp; Terrine—for our friends, the 3 H’s.—i.e. the Hookers and Harvey. Of <hi rend="italic">Phænogamous plants</hi> I have but a few—about 200 lots; of <hi rend="italic">Crypts</hi>. (mostly Lichens), about 600, and of <hi rend="italic">Algæ</hi>, about 500 Lots—making, in all, about 1300 separate lots—of which, if <hi rend="italic">half</hi> prove to be of Service, I shall be amply repaid. To Dr. Harvey, I have only sent specimens of <hi rend="italic">Algæ</hi>, which, however, will cause the gross total to amount to nearly 2000 separate lots—all marked, &amp; commented upon! A job which I have only just brought to a conclusion, which has consumed all my spare time, and which I hope not to have to do again. I think, I must have told you, that I had received from the Doctor a copy of his splendid “<hi rend="italic">Neries</hi>” (the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. part), in /47, and, in Jany./48, I promised him to do what I could for him. I hope his patience has not been quite exhausted in waiting so very long for the fulfilment of my promise, and even now (or, rather, when he gets the specimens, which are about to be shipped), he will find so many bad, half rotten &amp; imperfect, that his opinion of me will not be improved, thereby. But I have done what I could; and, shall, I believe, henceforward be almost necessitated to give up the <hi rend="italic">work</hi>—for such I now find it to be.—Quite enough, <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, fully to employ any one person. And, when I speak of giving it up—it is upon the principle of Dr. Johnson (as reported by Boswell), who would not taste wine, because, forsooth, if he commenced he would be sure to go right through;—and, so, I think, I must be content to relinquish my favorite pursuit, because, I have <hi rend="italic">not </hi>time to do it <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, and I cannot, for the life of me, be satisfied to do it badly. I have not, I confess, greatly cared to send off my boxes till now, as Dr. Joseph has been away visiting all nations:—one day we have him in Egypt—that land which has well been denominated “<hi rend="italic">the Mother of Sciences and the race of Gods</hi>”—seriously contemplating the Pyramids, and there musing intently over the mighty dead;—and the next, rattling across the Arabian deserts like a true man-o’-war’s man! Again, we have him steaming down the Red Sea—the cliffs of which, with Sinai towering above them, must necessarily have recalled him to grave soliloquy—and, anon, on Elephant-riding in the Himalayan Jungles!! I sincerely hope he will reach his paternal roof in safety, and, being doubly moored (this time), get laid up in ordinary and in full pay for some few years at least. It is now about 12 years since I first had the honor of sending Sir William specimens of the N.Z. flora, and ever since I have been adding thereto; and I really do wish to know somewhat more of the Botany of this Country than the less than the tithe of a tithe of the same which has since then been published, and most of which I knew before. In so speaking, however, I do not include what the French have done; for, unfortunately (again! see how my “malignant planet” works!!) their publications I have never seen, although Dr. Jos. says he forwarded them to me. <hi rend="italic">Raoul’s </hi>I should much liked to have got, but as I have long ago clean forgot all the little French I once knew, I care not <hi rend="italic">to order</hi> any work in that tongue.</p>
         <p>I hope that “<hi rend="italic">Sp. Filicum</hi>” has not died a natural death. I have long ago received the iv. part which completes the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. vol. The “<hi rend="italic">Icones</hi>” has, doubtless, ceased to be; and the “<hi rend="italic">London Journal of Botany</hi>” is, I suppose, merged into the “<hi rend="italic">Kew Garden Miscellany</hi>”. My English friends have been very kind—and I have had lots of Books sent me—among which, “Strickland on the <hi rend="italic">Dodo</hi>”— “Ralfs on the <hi rend="italic">Desmideæ</hi>”—“Hooker’s <hi rend="italic">Rhododendrons</hi>”, and splendid “Centuryof <hi rend="italic">Orchidaceous Plants</hi>”, have greatly interested me. From Reeves I have heard nothing, ditto returned. I have also had a letter from another new correspondent of Botl. fame—<hi rend="italic">Ralfs</hi>; accompanied, too, with a whole lot of specimens of the English Flora in very excellent state. Would that I could immediately reply thereto as I ought, but this I cannot <hi rend="italic">now </hi>do. For, although I know that there are several Collectors—Scotch, French, and German—here, all busily engaged, I will still hope, that Hooker will, ere long, resuscitate all those long-buried New Zealanders—and <hi rend="underline italic">then</hi> I shall gladly remember you, &amp; Ralfs, and one or two others, to the utmost stretch of my means. I have recently written to my agents, to send me, <hi rend="italic">Acharius Lichenographia Universalis</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Hooker’s B. Flora</hi>, &amp; some other similar works. I have been much pleased with an <hi rend="italic">Enumeration of N. American Lichens</hi>, by Tuckerman, which has reached me. Have you ever seen any of the Scientific Publications of the American Exploring Expedition, which, under Com. Wilkes, was in these seas about 12 years ago? I have seen the <hi rend="italic">Ethnographical </hi>part—a ponderous 4to. vol., and have, in fact, ordered it, and I should greatly like to get hold of their <hi rend="italic">Botany</hi> if it has been published. In my present lot to Sir William there is not very much of novelty among the <hi rend="italic">phænogamous</hi> plants; the principal ones comprise—another handsome <hi rend="italic">Pittosporum</hi>, 2 fine <hi rend="italic">Gaultheriæ</hi>, another <hi rend="italic">Dracophyllum</hi>, a little <hi rend="italic">Liliaceous</hi> plant—a perfect gem!—a few more <hi rend="italic">Orchideæ</hi>, a couple of <hi rend="italic">Veronicæ</hi>, perhaps another <hi rend="italic">Podocarpus</hi>, ditto <hi rend="italic">Fagus</hi>, ditto <hi rend="italic">Suttonia</hi>, ditto <hi rend="italic">Coriaria</hi>, ditto <hi rend="italic">Elæocarpus</hi>, and a curious climbing umbelliferous plant, possibly an <hi rend="italic">Angelica</hi>:—and, also, of the larger <hi rend="italic">Crypts</hi>.—a Fern or two, but of nothing will I now speak positively. In <hi rend="italic">Lichens</hi>, and the smaller <hi rend="italic">Algæ</hi>, I trust much will be found both new &amp; interesting.</p>
         <p>I have, also, procured a couple of the ancient and all but quite extinct N. Zealand <hi rend="italic">rat</hi>; which, until just now (and notwithstanding all my endeavours, backed, too, by large rewards,) I never saw. It is, without doubt, a true <hi rend="italic">mus</hi>—smaller than our English black rat (<hi rend="italic">mus rattus</hi>), and not unlike it. This little animal once inhabited the plains &amp; <hi rend="italic">Fagus </hi>forests of N. Zealand, in countless thousands, and was both the common food &amp; great delicacy of the Natives—and already it is all but quite classed among the things which were. I have, also, a <hi rend="italic">Bat</hi>—which I believe to belong to the genus <hi rend="italic">Vespertilio</hi>, at all events widely (<hi rend="italic">generically</hi>) distinct from the species mentioned by Gray, in Dieffenbach’s N.Z., vol. ii. p.296. This little creature I kept “alive” a whole month, and was not a little amused with its habits. And, among other novelties, I have discovered another &amp; very distinct species of <hi rend="italic">Vegetable Caterpillar</hi>, of which, however, I have only hitherto detected 2 specimens. It differs widely in general appearance from <hi rend="italic">Sphæria Robertsii</hi>, and is <lb/>somewhat thus.</p>
         <p>Some fine specimens of <hi rend="italic">Aseroe</hi>, and of that other nearly allied genus,<hi rend="italic"> Ileodictya</hi>, of which I have a new &amp; very large species, which I call, <hi rend="italic">I. laticostæ</hi>, and which, when fully evolved, forms a living mat of nearly 18 inches in girth!—</p>
         <p>You enquire after an <hi rend="italic">Apteryx</hi>.—How delighted should I be to succeed in getting you one. Three years ago, Owen expressed a similar wish, &amp; I have repeatedly tried but failed. Yet here they still are in the mountain forest, though, doubtless, fast hastening towards extinction.</p>
         <p>I saw a live one in its wild state two years ago in the dense woods of the interior; I saw it clearly, and watched its movements for some time without being at all perceived by the creature. It moved quickly along,—much like a hen when running after a fly. On seeing me it quickly dived into the untrodden recesses of the forest. Two live ones were lately taken by the “Acheron” steamer to Sydney, where they died; these were obtained at the Bay of Islands—where, also, I once got three at one time; the largest &amp; finest of which I dare say you have seen as I gave it to Lady Franklin; the second I gave to Mr. Taylor; and the third (a small one, and which I believe to be a distinct sp.) to one of the Government Officers, on the arrival of the Govr. Since then I have not been able to obtain another, although I have offered a great price for one. The fact is—the younger Natives do not know <hi rend="italic">how </hi>to take them, and the elder ones having but few wants and these fully supplied, do not care to do so. Further, they can only be captured by night, and the dog must be well trained to be of service; consequently, my hopes of getting any specimens are but faint.</p>
         <p>With regard to the Moa (<hi rend="italic">Dinornis</hi>), after which you also enquire, I candidly confess I have not cared to do much, because so very much has recently been done by others, who are not only far better qualified for such research, and have more time for it, but who also reside, or visit, the very “diggings” of the Moa.—Witness, Mantell’s account, to which you refer. I should much like to see his paper; and, also, my paper <hi rend="italic">as republished</hi> by Owen in the “<hi rend="italic">Annals of Nat. History</hi>”, in August/44, (mentioned by Owen himself, in his splendid 4to. memoir on the <hi rend="italic">Dinornis</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Palapteryx</hi>). I saw an extract from Mantell’s paper, (or rather, I think, this was by the <hi rend="italic">junior </hi>Mantell,) published in one of our Wellington Papers, in which I was gratified in finding him express strongly his belief concerning the truth of my deductions as to the age in which the <hi rend="italic">Dinornis </hi>lived. That such a bird <hi rend="italic">now</hi> exists! or had existed during the occupancy of these Islands by the present race of Aborigines, is, to me, most fallacious. I have, during my residence here, obtained a few bones of these birds—some, too, of very large size, larger, I almost think, than any which have been described by Owen,—but I have never yet found time to examine &amp; compare them. But really, now that the Natives have such a preposterous idea concerning the transcendent value of every-thing after which a European enquires—which is sure to be connected in their minds with gold—that it is a very difficult matter to get them to procure any specimen, however trivial or common.—</p>
         <p>You have, indeed, some lovely <hi rend="italic">Algæ</hi> on your shores, and I dare still to hope, that ere long we shall be reciprocating delight over our exchange of specimens. Yet ours are not perhaps very beautiful—they may be curious—and cannot fail of proving interesting.—<figure>

         </p>
         <p>I think I saw in some Paper, brief mention made of a <hi rend="italic">new </hi>Scientific Society having sprung up among you. What is it? Is it a <hi rend="italic">Phœnix</hi>; arising from the ashes of its sire, of which it will not be ashamed, and which it is gloriously to surpass? or, is it a kind of <hi rend="italic">anti</hi>-association? Seeing that our Colonies may almost be termed, the very prolific hot-bed of opposition.—</p>
         <p>From an English Paper I gather that Mr. Gell is <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, and exerting himself in his Vocation. I suppose he will, in due time, return to you again. What he must think of my not answering his long and friendly Letter of /47 (only now however received), I cannot divine:—I hope he is endowed richly with that never-failing blessing—<hi rend="italic">Charity</hi>. If you correspond, and should you write again to him, just mention, the 3 whole years which his Letter took to crawl from Tasmania to Cape Kidnapper; how it wholly escaped kidnapping by the way is a mystery.—</p>
         <p>You speak of being “₤100. out of pocket in publishing the Tasmanian Journal.”—How is this? Why not call upon the Members to bear their respective shares therein? Poor though I am, yet cheerfully shall pay my proportion be it what it may. Let me know, when you next write this way, and I will transmit it.—</p>
         <p>Well, now, I must indeed conclude. I trust the <hi rend="italic">length</hi> of this Letter will bear ample testimony to my <hi rend="italic">good will </hi>towards you—my time being my greatest valuable. And hoping to hear from you, at your convenience, and fully intending, one day, to make you ample amends for all.—</p>
         <p>       Believe me always,</p>
         <p>               Most sincerely yours                    William Colenso.</p>
