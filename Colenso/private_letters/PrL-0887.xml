         <p rend="end">Napier Saturday nt.,<lb/>18/xi/93.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>Thanks for your kind &amp; welcome letter of 12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. w. parcel.—although on reading <hi rend="italic">it</hi>—I got an ugly twinge, when I found, you had <hi rend="italic">not </hi>got through your <hi rend="italic">heavy </hi>labour! but this passed on recollecting, that it was owing to <hi rend="italic">your own</hi> statement—in your former letter—as to the <hi rend="italic">hour of your freedom. </hi>And now, I note what <hi rend="italic">you say</hi>, as to suppy. wk.,—<hi rend="italic">over by this tiome</hi>—or, at all events, by Tuesday mg. next, when this may reach you.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Thanks </hi>for your <hi rend="italic">kind &amp; able</hi> sheet of corrns. in Q. On receiving yrs. I was <hi rend="italic">too busy</hi>! (<hi rend="italic">bound</hi>—as it were!) on a long letter (draughted) for England in <hi rend="italic">reply </hi>to one of <hi rend="italic">April</hi> last!! too often put off. (Shall I tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—I have many more (2 bundles) in same list) and it was not until I had finished—<hi rend="italic">the day after</hi>—that I would look into yours: but, having got “clear decks”, I took it up w. Q. “<hi rend="italic">with a will</hi>”—determined, <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>, to have done w. it: and <hi rend="italic">now</hi>—<hi rend="underline italic">All is over</hi>!!</p>
         <p>I went to work on Ms. with your suggestions, and <hi rend="italic">deleted </hi>with red ink <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> you had noted</hi>: then, to make <hi rend="italic">fair copy </hi>of all those cut-in-&amp;-out sheets, and, lastly, to <hi rend="italic">add </hi>a little more at end. And now, <hi rend="italic">All is done</hi>! &amp; Ms. <hi rend="italic">ready </hi>to go back to Wgn., &amp; <hi rend="italic">on </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">this account</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> I am now writing to you</hi>.—–</p>
         <p>1. To whom, had I better send it? To Dr. H., <hi rend="italic">or </hi>to Gore? (I should <hi rend="italic">greatly prefer </hi>sending it to <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi> for reading (if read?) but, perhaps, better not—as I fancy that both you &amp; Tregear can <hi rend="italic">manage better</hi>—on hearing it—to have your say)</p>
         <p>2. In looking into the <hi rend="italic">Rules </hi>of Wgn. P. Sy., I find—a paper to be read is to have its <hi rend="italic">title </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">time </hi>in reading, given in to Secy., who is to report same to Council, who will decide—<hi rend="italic">i.e. </hi>give “approval”: Is this generally acted on with you?</p>
         <p>3. I should like (1.) for its <hi rend="italic">title</hi>, &amp;c to come <hi rend="italic">before C. </hi>when Tregear is <hi rend="italic">there</hi>: and (2.) for it to be <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, also, ditto:—but I know nothing of <hi rend="italic">his </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">offl</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. movements</hi>.</p>
         <p>4. And as your season is, I suppose, drawing to a close—I should like, <hi rend="italic">also</hi>, for no time to be lost, so that M, T, &amp; Co. should not be able to say—too late, put off till <hi rend="italic">next</hi> season, &amp;c.—–</p>
         <p>[<hi rend="italic">Private</hi>. I believe, from what I recollect of old times, that when Maskell was living at Xt.Ch., he was <hi rend="italic">not </hi>at all on good terms w. V. Haast: and, I also, fear, there were early strong differences, ’tween Von H. &amp; Hector, on geological matters.]</p>
         <p>My own <hi rend="italic">present </hi>motion is, (seeing <hi rend="italic">you </hi>are <hi rend="italic">out,</hi>) to send a note <hi rend="italic">to </hi>Gore as above, &amp; the Ms. <hi rend="italic">to </hi>Dr. H.—as I did with “Status Quo” = Owen?—but <hi rend="italic">I wait to hear from you</hi>.—</p>
         <p>The Ms. is rather less than it was before in bulk—but then the pages have nearly ⅓rd. <hi rend="italic">left in margin</hi>. I have folld. yr. ex., &amp; worked hard. I have left <hi rend="italic">no </hi>pp. w. deleted lines, and also made 2 pp. of the <hi rend="italic">crowded </hi>1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. p.—&amp; have taken out all the par. re the <hi rend="italic">2 translns. </hi>You will smile (?—or stare!) when you read, or hear, my <hi rend="italic">new additions</hi> (2 pps.) re <hi rend="italic">Phœnix</hi>, &amp;c.—But enough.—</p>
         <p>Your news of yr. dear son have both pleased &amp; depressed me—I hope you now have <hi rend="italic">better </hi>symptoms: here <hi rend="italic">lonely </hi>I often think on <hi rend="italic">you all</hi>.</p>
         <p>I was to have been <hi rend="italic">in Bush </hi>this wk. having last wk. fully arranged w. <hi rend="italic">them</hi>—but on Sunday 12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I was seriously unwell </hi>(stomach)—commd. on Saty., obliged to go to bed, fast, slops! med., &amp;c—better on My. evg, but <hi rend="italic">unfit to travel on Tuesday </hi>as I <hi rend="italic">had arranged</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, “writs out for 28<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.” which, to vote, would cause me to return, so I put off till 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. wk. in Decr. (?5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>), when I hope to go. I suppose you know common news—Hobbs, Hastings, marrd. to Miss Edwards, Barry’s daur., “Mrs <hi rend="italic">Gush</hi>”, dead: ditto Mrs Vautier senr., her son’s w. died a fortnight ago.</p>
         <p>The long Ms. from Kew to me, (beautifully written,) is headed— “Hepaticæ, named by F. Stephani, Leipzig”. Suter (Xt.Ch.), who transld. for me, says, the German P.O. is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> particular in making enquiry, whereas they <hi rend="italic">are </hi>so in Switz.:—also, very likely there are several “F. Stephani”; and, had I written “<hi rend="italic">Botaniker</hi>” instead of <hi rend="italic">cryptogamist</hi>, the packet might have reached him. Indeed, S. says, he doubts if they knew the meaning of <hi rend="italic">Cryptogamist</hi>! But Stephani,—as a Cryptogc. expert, has a world-wide &amp; old reputation. I note the word <hi rend="italic">Cryptt</hi>.—has a big 5-line pica ? appended—done w. a <hi rend="italic">blue </hi>pencil. This little incident serves to vex me exceedingly!—which was not allayed until I heard from Suter; as I had supposed, from the omission of “Prof”, of “Dr.”, or “von”, or some <hi rend="italic">tail piece</hi>, F.St. was <hi rend="italic">infra dig</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="underline italic">so</hi> refused it!! The 2 Govts. had plenty to do for their 1d. stamp! </p>
         <p>And now that I have gone through all the preliminaries &amp; superfluities (or wrappers and dunnage of my cargo)—I will enter on the solid &amp; real.—–</p>
         <p>True: you have <hi rend="italic">not </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">quite</hi> surprised me w. your sad relation of dissolution of partnership—but nevertheless I dislike it,—aye very much indeed!—heightened too from the <hi rend="italic">fact </hi>that I do not know what advice, or even good suggestion, to offer—not knowing <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> the <hi rend="italic">many </hi>circumstances, I trust you have some good honest clear-headed business man there at hand, who could tender you <hi rend="italic">good advice</hi>—so much apparently, depends on it. Be very careful, look on <hi rend="italic">all </hi>sides, &amp; long, ere you <hi rend="italic">again decide</hi>. I fear, at present, to say much on this head, from ignorance of your sitn. I grieve over it, &amp; would it were <hi rend="italic">not </hi>so.</p>
         <p>Papers say,—“Dean Hovell has been invited to preach (2 sermons) at St. Peter’s, Wgn, on 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., and that he has accepted it—leaving N. on 19<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>!—Some (perhaps) <hi rend="italic">may </hi>think—with an eye to the Bishopric!—our Bp. is gone N., on his usual long Maori tour for <hi rend="italic">3 months</hi>! who will serve the Cathedral in Hovell’s <hi rend="italic">absence</hi>,—or who Waipawa, when Eccles leaves, is unknown. The Waipawa &amp; Kaikoura joint Commee., could <hi rend="italic">not </hi>(of course!) agree; I never supposed they would—5 on each side!! Young Clark (poor dear fellow!) they say— “Is as well as cod. be expected.”</p>
         <p>Last Sunday I gave notice in Ch.—I should preach my <hi rend="italic">last </hi>on 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. &amp; after that I shall (D.V.) spend 2–3 days there to see the Gorge tunnel, Manurata Bridge (to Pahiatua), &amp;c.—and possibly leave here for N. <hi rend="italic">about </hi>25<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—much of course depends on the weather. I shall make every exertion to get into the Bush (<hi rend="italic">once more</hi>!) ere I go.</p>
         <p>Hope you may hear from Bassett to yr. satisfaction: he has certainly not treated me well. Had I gone to N. to Sy’s. meeting on <hi rend="italic">14</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>., I had intended to read a paper or two from Dr. Marshall’s book—particularly of the <hi rend="italic">extra kind </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">careful </hi>treatment <hi rend="italic">Mrs </hi>Guard &amp; her 2 children received from those <hi rend="italic">wild </hi>Maoris, during the 5 months they were prisoners there: it has always seemed, to me, a great &amp; good &amp; delicate <hi rend="italic">trait </hi>in the Maori character: I am sure it would interest the <hi rend="italic">fem. </hi>part of my audience. Miss Large was <hi rend="italic">here </hi>to Robertshawes Concert last Friday, (with others from Woodville, &amp;c,) she retg. to N. on Monday. the pain that began <hi rend="italic">that </hi>aftn. spoiled it. Here I close: I think there were not a few things in my last letter<hi rend="underline italic">s</hi> you have “skipped”. And with kindest regards &amp; best wishes Believe me—</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Rain all day, <hi rend="italic">general </hi>here of <hi rend="italic">late</hi>: roof wet thro!!</p>
         <p>I have several things for <hi rend="italic">you </hi>but will not send till I know you are free—or <hi rend="italic">pretty </hi>free.</p>
         <p>     With kindest regards &amp; best wishes. <lb/>                           Yours ever, <lb/>                                                               W. Colenso</p>
