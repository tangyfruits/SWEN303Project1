         <p rend="end">Dannevirke, <lb/>Saturday 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Septr.<lb/> (noon)  1892.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Luff,</p>
         <p>I am thinking on you, and have concluded to drop you a line before I leave this afternoon for Woodville, (although it can not be <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> so satisfactory as either you or I could desire,) to thank you for your very kind remembrance of me as shown by “wire”, by letter, and by your valued loan of a picture.</p>
         <p>I came hither on Wednesday last, (to <hi rend="italic">resume</hi> my old employ at Woodville!) and on arriving here at 3 p.m. found your “wire” awaiting me—re-addressed from Napier:—well I waited until Wednesday night, late, when I also got your kind note—returned, thus far, from Napier. Yesterday morning I wrote to my man there, to go to Ry. Station &amp; get the picture, &amp; by early train (noon here) I received the enclosed card: so, no doubt, the picture is safe, and will I trust this day be <hi rend="italic">housed</hi> at my old hermitage: though <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I may have the pleasure of <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> it is another thing!—</p>
         <p>I may mention, that <hi rend="italic">early</hi> in this year (Jany. I think) I received from Sir Jos. Hooker—a case containing a copy of his portrait which had been <hi rend="italic">drawn</hi> for the R.Sy.—this “photogravure” (I think) is by Hurkheimer (or some such name); it is large—frame &amp; all—about 30in.x18. I had <hi rend="italic">much trouble</hi> in getting it thro’ Customs! (as <hi rend="italic">usual</hi>) not being able to satisfy <hi rend="italic">H.M.C</hi>. as to its value! and at last having got it (and being <hi rend="italic">very unwell</hi> &amp; leaving Napier for Bush) merely <hi rend="italic">saw </hi>it! &amp; put it back into its case or coffin!—You, who once knew a little of my rooms at N. would be surprised to see them now—with <hi rend="italic">scores</hi> of packages &amp; bundles; among than nearly 20 parcels of books, <hi rend="underline italic">unopened</hi>! some from R.Sy., Linn. Sy., London Booksellers, Craig, &amp; others, and some even <hi rend="italic">ordered </hi>by me,—but enough of this.</p>
         <p rend="center">_________</p>
         <p>I had <hi rend="italic">cleared out</hi> from here on 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. inst.,—Mr. Eccles having been appointed <hi rend="italic">resident</hi> Minister at Woodville (after 17 years at Waipawa!). I took duty for him on the 4th. at Waip., that he might be doing so on <hi rend="italic">that day</hi> at Woodville, and then it turned out that he <hi rend="italic">could not leave</hi> Waip. until after 3 months notice!!! (all right enough) and so, to please &amp; to aid <hi rend="italic">him </hi>(&amp; also the Ch-of-E. folk at Woodville) I have at <hi rend="italic">last</hi> given way &amp; come back again to serve until his “3 months” are up—perhaps <hi rend="italic">alternately</hi> w. him at Waip., as there really seemed no help for it—or <hi rend="italic">close</hi> Wdv. Ch!! Doubly heavy at <hi rend="italic">present,</hi> as W. has <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Presbytn. Minister. I <hi rend="italic">do not like</hi> to reside at Wdv., too low &amp; <hi rend="italic">wet </hi>&amp; cold for me.</p>
         <p>Of late (4 wks.) I have suffered much from rheumatism <hi rend="italic">fixed </hi>in right shoulder <hi rend="italic">joint</hi>, &amp; down arm, &amp; some days in wrist &amp; fingers,—so that I write w. difficulty &amp; in <hi rend="italic">pain</hi>—as I am <hi rend="italic">now doing</hi>—but <hi rend="italic">will not give in</hi>.</p>
         <p>Of course you will have heard of John <hi rend="italic">Buchanan</hi>’s death—&amp; of several others whom you (or <hi rend="italic">we</hi>) once knew so well.</p>
         <p>I hope you &amp; <hi rend="italic">all </hi>yours are well: please remember me most kindly to your son &amp; with kind regards.</p>
         <p>             Believe me, yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                                             W. Colenso.</p>
