         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have received your welcome note of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> inst, &amp; I thank you much for it. I assure you it is quite refreshing to receive such a com­munication as yours; few, scarcely any, care (or perhaps have, or <hi rend="italic">find,</hi> time) to think on such matters much less to write. I may say, that I have since I sent you round the Vols (XII) to the town members, met them all, &amp; not a word; one of them I did venture to ask, if he had got his Vol— “Oh yes, but no time to look at it”.</p>
         <p>Happy you, <hi rend="italic">Country</hi> men.</p>
         <p>If you receive your letters say, on Tuesday or so, I should not write today—­I believe you only get them once a week,—on Saturdays—so I now write in haste.</p>
         <p>I do so, to say,—first, that you have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> more to pay for your Hand Book;—I did not intend you to suppose that you had,—I merely mentioned what dues had been paid for binding alone, to show that in your choosing the <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> Vols, you have the cheaper &amp; better lot.—I am right glad you like the Hand Book—there is much in it of good on <hi rend="italic">General</hi> Botany, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I am very busy writing for our meeting on Monday; I found, in calling on Dr Spencer early this week,—that it was all left to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to prepare a dish—or no supper.</p>
         <p>And Dr Hector stirs me up on “tother tack”, to keep up our branch.</p>
         <p>Certainly <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has done us (H.B.) great honour, in inserting <hi rend="italic">all</hi> our papers; many (I know) were rejected from Auckland branch, &amp; from others too.</p>
         <p>But I must close. Hope you are all well. A letter from you always wel­come.</p>
         <p>                             Bel me</p>
         <p>                                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Had I known, that you write about your hearing &amp; seeing the Green Lizards <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi>,—I should have gladly inserted it.</p>
