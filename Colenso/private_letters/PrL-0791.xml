         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Thursday night,<lb/>July 16, 1891</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>I yesterday sent you a short suppmy. note <hi rend="italic">re</hi> No XC Qly. Revw. &amp;c. Well—this mg. <hi rend="italic">early</hi> I went to the Athenæum, &amp; there overhauled a <hi rend="italic">dire</hi> lot of Qly. Reviews—but (as before) <hi rend="underline italic">all in vain</hi>!! They are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> consecutive.—I came away much disappointed.—</p>
         <p>But now <hi rend="italic">another</hi> phase of this (precious) trouble, has presented itself (which, however, may prove to be <hi rend="italic">the </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">solution,</hi>) viz. That it is <hi rend="italic">very likely </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">vol</hi>. XC. is meant, by Collier, though <hi rend="italic">not</hi> stated by him. I am the more inclined to this from a comparison of the nos. <hi rend="italic">of the vols.</hi>—with the years in which they were published: thus, <hi rend="italic">vol</hi>.48 (contg. <hi rend="underline italic">no</hi>. XC) was pubd. in 1831,—a long way too <hi rend="italic">early</hi> for Owen’s work: and <hi rend="italic">vol.</hi> 98 (addendum) was pubd in 1855–6,—? too <hi rend="italic">late</hi> for a Review: but <hi rend="italic">vol</hi>. XC, would apparently suit very well.—</p>
         <p>However I have <hi rend="italic">ventured</hi> to write fully to Capt. R., directing his attention (and also Librarian’s) to p.134, Collier, &amp; stating fully <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I want,—&amp; <hi rend="italic">why</hi>: and if <hi rend="underline italic">vol</hi>. <hi rend="italic">XC</hi>. should prove to be correct, why there is <hi rend="italic">no trouble about it</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I was very much <hi rend="underline italic">astonished</hi> today, to find, on again referring to Collier, that <hi rend="italic">he had never stated</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">the </hi>“<hi rend="underline italic">No</hi>
            <hi rend="underline">.</hi>” (!!!) how I came to that outrageous conclusion I don’t know: Is there some <hi rend="italic">diablerie</hi> in it?—Qy Brandon’s imps? Who <hi rend="italic">heard </hi>(?) what I said.</p>
         <p>In town this mg.—seeing I had (for once!) some spare time there—I called to see your brother, in that dear old office! found him <hi rend="underline italic">well</hi>, &amp; at work, busy he told me: &amp; that all the family were well. He was <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> very well, though wearing specs. He said his Father had recd. a letter from you—<hi rend="italic">this mg.</hi> I think, &amp; that yr. Uncle John was in time to see his sister, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Neal met me, &amp; asked “If I intended hearing Mk. Pearse’s Lecture on 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>.? I sd. “I <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">disliked</hi> that building (Th. Royal), as I had <hi rend="italic">always</hi> caught severe cold in going there: hence, of late years, I had always abstained.” N. said, “I could go into the Dress Circle, &amp;c.” I replied, “I would think over it: <hi rend="italic">weather </hi>might prevent me”.</p>
         <p>Weather very fine today, quite mild: I am better than I was yesterday: I <hi rend="italic">must move out more while</hi> in N., &amp; take <hi rend="italic">long</hi> walks as I do in Bush.—</p>
         <p>I was surprised to find, from N. that Pearse (who was <hi rend="italic">in Auckland</hi>) was coming hither <hi rend="italic">from</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Wgn</hi>., &amp; only here for <hi rend="italic">1</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">night</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I have not yet received my expected summons for Waipawa but <hi rend="italic">may</hi> get it tonight, &amp; <hi rend="italic">may</hi> go thither tomorrow.</p>
         <p>Hoping this fragment in continuation of my letter of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> may find you free from dyspepsia &amp; all quite well—And with kind regards, bel. me ever,</p>
         <p>Yours affy.,</p>
         <p>W.Colenso</p>
         <p>I ordd. thro’ Craig, copy of “The World’s Great Explorers: Life of Magellan”. I dare say L. &amp; B. has it—do look at the <hi rend="underline italic">old</hi> picture of “M. passing the Straits,” p.210: it is a rarity—<hi rend="italic">unique</hi>!! And also at the view of Lisbon (in the olden time). The clipping you will find in the “Jottings” pamphlet.—</p>
         <p>IX. p.m. Bob. just back from town bringing 2 letters—one from <hi rend="italic">Tregear</hi> (owing to your kindly giving him my message) a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> (or good) letter from <hi rend="italic">his point of view</hi>: I must ansr. it, but I should <hi rend="italic">first</hi> like to dip into his book.—One from Kirk, ackng. rect. of big parcel of plants, &amp;c—&amp; sending me some spns—which <hi rend="italic">I do not want</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">shall return. I am going entirely out of that line</hi>.—</p>
