         <p rend="end">Napier, Novr. 7<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1885.</p>
         <p>G. Didsbury, Esq<lb/>Wellington.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>A few days ago I received your letter of 26<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. ulto. while at Norsewood (70.m. Bush), from which place I returned last evening, and lose no time in replying &amp; thanking you for your communication. (I may mention, that I had gone to the forests for a few days, hoping change of air would relieve me of my old winter cough,—which, though not harassing, was unpleasant, especially at nights: and I find myself much better.)—</p>
         <p>I particularly note what you kindly inform me concerning your <hi rend="italic">long </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">short</hi> accents, &amp;c., and think you should lose no time in obtaining same, especially <hi rend="italic">caps</hi>. and sm. <hi rend="italic">caps</hi>. I believe the <hi rend="italic">run</hi> will be most on A., and next on E. &amp; O., but I do not suppose that any great number would be required. I wish I had written to you earlier on the subject, as I fear it may be some time before you can possibly get a supply from “Home” (as you say):—could you not obtain them from Melbourne? I shall strive hard to send you some clean copy in Jany.,—and so fulfil my promise to the Government.</p>
         <p>I quite agree w. you as to size of book (demi 8vo.), also, of type (Long Primer): and that the leading Maori words should be in caps. or sm. caps. Riddle (Lat. Eng. Dicty.) gives his Eng. <hi rend="italic">meanings</hi> in Italics, w. parts of speech, quotations, examples, &amp;c. in Rom.,—but I think the <hi rend="italic">meanings </hi>will look better in Rom., and parts of speech, &amp;c., in Italics.—–</p>
         <p>Be assured, you shall have very clean copy: I hope my hand may hold out in making it: I anticipate a very heavy job. I purpose making the copy on fcp. fol., leaving at foot about ¼th. blank for additions &amp; alterations: as some of the former may come to hand from Maori correspondents &amp; others while I am engaged on the work. For my part I would much rather it could be <hi rend="italic">all</hi> clean copied before that any should be put into your hands.</p>
         <p>                                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                                     Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I return, enclosed, the 2 leaves from your Type Spn. Book.</p>
