         <p>H.Hill, Esq<lb/>Inspector of Schools<lb/>Napier,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I cannot tell you how very much I have been interested in reading your annual Report of the Pupil Teachers’ Examination that appeared in the “Herald” this morning. I note, with pleasure those pupils of whom you have reported so highly,—especially, Oscar Alpers, Charles Laws, &amp; Margaret Morgan. I see you had suggested to the Board, that a small Book prize should be given to them,—but it is not stated that the Board had agreed to do so. Be that as it may, I wish, through you, to make them a small present, say, ₤1. each: also, to Agnes Downs of the Native Protestant School, a similar sum of ₤1.—and to those three (3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi> year),—Robert B. Ryder, Havelock; George Garnell, Wairoa; and Eric Oatridge, Gisborne,—the sum of 10/- each: total, = ₤<hi rend="italic">5.10.0</hi>, cheque enclosed.</p>
         <p>I leave it to you, Sir, to present the same to them either in money or in <hi rend="italic">suitable</hi> books—<hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> sectarian ones</hi>: and you may also (if you think it better on the whole to do so,) conceal the name of the donor,—and merely say, from a friend &amp; well-wisher.—</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
