      <p rend="end">Paihia, Bay of Islands, Jany. 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1840.—</p>
      <p>To the Secretaries of the Church Missionary Society</p>
      <p>Frs and Brethren,</p>
      <p>1. My last Letter to you was in Feby. 1839 pr. the “Elizabeth,” Capt. Corry, which together with a small parcel of Books then sent, I trust you safely received. Since then I have been employed in the Printing Department in getting out the following Books:—</p>
      <p>Prayer Book, 36 pp. demy 12mo . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27,000<lb/>Pukapuka Wakaako, 24 pp. demy 12mo . . . . . . . 10,000<lb/>Pukapuka Kauwau, 4 pp. demy 12mo . . . . . . . .  4,000<lb/>Kupu Ui, 8 pp. demy 12mo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .3,000<lb/>Lessons for Schools . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,000<lb/>Catechisms, 16 pp. post 8vo. (unfinished) . . . . . . 10,000<lb/>Prayer Book, 36 pp. demy 12mo (do—) . . . . . . . . .6,000<lb/>Pukapuka Aroha, 24 pp. demy 12mo. . . . . . . . . . . .2,000</p>
      <p>The <hi rend="italic">Prayer Book </hi>contains the Morning and Evening Services of our Church; a Collection of Hymns, &amp; a few additional Prayers, this has gone thro 3 Editions, the 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. of 4,000, the 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. of 3,000, and the 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. of 20,000,—making 27,000 Copies. <hi rend="italic">Pukapuka Wakaako</hi>, is, as will be seen, a Primer, written, &amp;c, by myself. <hi rend="italic">Pukapuka Kauwau </hi>is the address of His Lordship the Bishop of Australia, to the Natives; translated by Revd. W. Williams. <hi rend="italic">Kupu Ui</hi>, is a kind of Mass-book intended for Schools, written by the Rev. R. Maunsell. <hi rend="italic">Prayer Book</hi>, last mentioned, of 6,000 Copies, is intended for the complete Edition of the Prayer Book now in printing, of which the first two and last half sheets are printed. There is a little difference in the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. half sheet from that in the small p. book now in circulation, inasmuch as it has a few Typographical alterations, and, also, in pp. 23 &amp; 24, it has a part of the Athanasian Creed, which falls into its proper place in those pages. <hi rend="italic">Pukapuka Aroha</hi>, is the Tract noticed in my last, written by myself and adopted here by a newly-formed Tract Society, (a branch of the Religious Tract Society, and called the New Zealand Auxiliary Religious Tract Society,). We printed 2,000 copies for them, they supplying Paper and paying for the Printing. This Society is composed of all persons who are interested in the Cause of Christ and who subscribe to support the same. J. Busby Esqr. Revd. W.Williams, Messrs. Wade, Baker, Ford, Clendon, and Mair, form the present Committee. They have lately met, and (having previously read) have adopted a portion of another Tract of mine in the Native Language, so as to make one of 24 pp., being an Exposition of the Errors of Rome. They have now a third of mine in the course of Reading, which I hope they will also receive. You will also perceive among the Books now sent a few little Notices concerning an Institution originated by Mr. Busby; hitherto, however, it has not received the support required, nor will it, I suppose, until Mr. B. visits England. A few <hi rend="italic">small</hi> allotments of Land which he sold the other day realized upwards of £800! “One-tenth” of this and of all future net proceeds of Sale is laid aside “for Religious and Educational purposes.” A second sale of some of his allotments of Land, takes place in a few days, when, I dare say, another Sum will be obtained to be added to the former.—</p>
      <p>2. Since I last wrote I have been enabled to pay a few visits to the Natives in the Wilderness. On Wednesday, March 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., I left this place on an Excursion to the Northward. <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>Arriving at the Waimate, and joining Mr. Wade, we proceeded together to Hokianga, down river to the N. Head, and up the N.W. Coast to Ẁaro, (nr. Kaitaia,) visited Kaitaia Station, from where Mr. Wade remaining behind, I proceeded to Cape Maria van Diemen, the “<hi rend="italic">Reinga</hi>”, i.e. the Hades of the New Zealanders. Returning, I crossed the Island (here very narrow) to the N.E. Coast, to Houhora, (Mt. Camel,) once more visited Kaitaia, returned, again, to the N.E. Coast, proceeding by the same to the Bay of Islands, visiting several villages in my way home; reaching the Station, on Friday, April 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. In this journey, too varied and interesting to be described in detail in the compass of a Letter, I saw much to <hi rend="italic">en</hi>courage and much to <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>courage us. On the one hand it was pleasing to observe the progress which the Gospel was making—on the other, it was painful to witness the opposition still made by many against the Truth; strange to say (not so, either, when the human heart is considered,) those who would not listen to the Gospel from us, have readily joined themselves with the Romish Church, and, in so doing, have not, as you may suppose, abated in their opposition to us and to our word. On June 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I left Paihia on a visit to the Natives on the outer Coast, from Wangaruru on to Owae and returned on the 25<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. of the same month. On September 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., I left, on a visit to the same, and returned on the 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi> October. On Decr. 7, I left the Bay in a little vessel for Wangarei, (Mr. Busby, who was going thither, having kindly offered me a free passage,) arriving there, I visited the different villages in that neighbourhood, found that nearly all were professing to be Christians.—I returned by way of the Coast to Owae, and Bay of Islands, reaching this Station on Decr. 24. I experienced very severe weather during this trip which made travelling very heavy. Wangarei had not been visited since I had carried the Gospel thither in Feby., 1836, 4 years since, although we have had communication from time to time with the Natives, and they have received Books from us. The route by which I returned was the one by which that Venerable Servant of Christ, the Revd. S. Marsden, had travelled over; no Missionary besides himself had ever gone over that ground. Dear Mr. Marsden! his preaching, the places where he slept, where he rested, where he fell in scaling the cliffs, &amp;c., &amp;c., are remembered and pointed out by the Natives, and, at some future day, may be, perhaps, cherished, as Mementos of the first Minister of Christ who visited the shores of New Zealand! Thus, you will perceive, my dear Sirs, that my time has been fully occupied. The Seed has been sown in <hi rend="underline italic">much</hi>
      <hi rend="italic"> weakness</hi>, it is true, alas! <hi rend="italic">too </hi>true, but it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the Planter, <hi rend="italic">nor </hi>the Waterer, but <hi rend="smallcaps italic">God</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, who <hi rend="italic">gives</hi> the Increase.</p>
      <p>3. The Society’s Letter, of Novr. 1838, pr. “Achilles,” did not reach us until the 19<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> of September, 1833,—I had received Rev. Mr. Jowett’s Letter to me, a day or two previous, and the Lord had enabled me to make the desire of my heart (which I made known to you in my last Letter of March 24/38,) a matter of prayer to Him—that He would be pleased to incline me this act in accordance with the wishes of the Society:—and which I hope I shall ever be enabled. The subject has, however, been very much on my mind of late, and I have been enabled, I trust, to lay it before the Lord; my thoughts thereon I subjoin for your consideration.</p>
      <p>4. When I accepted the offer made me by the C.M.S. to go out to New Zealand as their Printer, I had no other intention, no other wish, than that of always acting, as such in fact, my dear Sirs, when on board the “Prince Regent,” on our passage from England, <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>I attempted to hold an Afternoon Service in the Steerage of the Ship with the Passengers there, I was obliged to discontinue the same from a hesitancy in speaking, which was exceeding painful not only to myself but to the bystander also, and my Brother Wade was of opinion, as well as my self, that I should never, perhaps, gain the N. Zealand language, so as to speak it fluently. I mention this merely to show that up to the time of my landing, in N. Zealand, I had not entertained such an idea, as that of being engaged in Ministerial work. However, shortly after my landing, I was approached to take the Afternoon English Service in Paihia Chapel, against this I made many remonstrances, for ’twas much against my inclination.—I was quite unused to such a duty, and, to say the truth, was afraid and ashamed to take it upon me, having to hold Service &amp; preach before the British Resident, the wives and families of the Missionaries, and the different people who attended the Chapel. True, I might have <hi rend="italic">read</hi> a Sermon of some one of the Divines of our Church, but there lay the greatest difficulty, namely, the <hi rend="italic">power</hi> to read, to enunciate, to give utterance to words, which I had not at command. How, then, did I manage? Why <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> helped me, strengthened me, yea, was my <hi rend="italic">strength</hi>, and, though many times have I gone to Church, trembling, ready to fall down by the way—yea, I have sat down to my solitary meal on the week-day, having the dreaded duty on the approaching Sabbath to meet, and I have been so acted on, as to be sickened at the mere prospect of the same—yet out of all, and in all, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> delivered me. Time passed by, and the Morning Service was, also, allotted me; and, shortly after, no less than 5 Services on the Lord’s day fell to my share, (2 English and 3 Native) which <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, in His infinite Goodness enabled me to get through.—So fulfilling towards His unworthy Servant, His most gracious promise, “As thy day is, so shall thy strength be”. I relate this, my dear Sirs, in order that you may perceive two things, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, that it was not by myself, nor of myself, nor through myself, in any way whatever, that I first opened my mouth in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> cause:—this, to me, is of great consolation; hence, I argue the lawfulness of the desire, continually cleaving to me, to Preach the unsearchable riches of Christ. I may, in some humble measure, say, with Paul, “I neither received” what I preached “of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ”. For I had had no Books granted me by the Society, and few, very few of my own; this was, doubtless, a blessing, for it drove me to examine, and diligently to compare Scripture, in order that I might be, in some measure, ready for the duties of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> House. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, that I have always been thus employed, and in being <hi rend="italic">thus </hi>employed, I was blessed in my labours. However this state of things could not possibly continue long; for, according to the Constitution and Canons of our Church, it was, to say the least of it, irregular, and could only be endured until such time as it could be remedied. That time, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> at a distance, is now arrived, or nearly so; and it will soon be an unfrequent thing for a Layman to stand up in the pulpit here, or at Kororareka; or at any other of the Chapels which may be erected, belonging to the Church of England, in the Bay of Islands. This, according to our Church is as it should be, and, I firmly believe, that such a regulation <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>will be by far for the best. But, what are persons in my situation to do? Sit down, quietly.—Give up those posts we once occupied, and in which we were blessed. <hi rend="italic">No</hi>, my Brethren, <hi rend="italic">that cannot be</hi>.—At least, I answer for myself,—<hi rend="italic">I cannot now go back</hi>. I have borne, though but in a small degree, the burden and heat of the day, and I cannot <hi rend="italic">now </hi>withdraw my hands from the Plough. I have been listened to and looked up to by the Natives,—I have been privileged and blessed by the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> among them,—I have kept myself from purchasing Land (having not a single foot of ground) in order than no obstacle should thus arise through me against the Gospel,—I have led a single life that I might be the more fully enabled to give my time to the Work of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>—I have, moreover, sat down, and well-considered the subject, and, allow me, my dear Sirs, most respectfully to say, I cannot give up the post, which, for more than Five Years I have been enabled to occupy—that of preaching the Gospel of Christ. I am willing to remain with the Press, and, in so doing, I want no assistance, at present, other than what I may get here, but I cannot, conscientiously, make up my mind to remain with the Press, and not to open my mouth in the Cause of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>. He first called &amp; sent me forth, and though I <hi rend="italic">then</hi> went very reluctantly to the work, <hi rend="italic">now</hi> it would be criminal in me to leave it; in short, my conscience would not permit me to take such a step. I have been for 5 years, in the constant practice of preaching &amp; teaching among Whites and Natives; on Shore, in chapels, in the Houses of the Settlers, in the Grog-shops, and in the open air, on board of vessels, &amp;c, &amp;c: I look at my own Insufficiency and utter unworthiness, and at the greatness of the responsibility resting on those who enter into the sacred duties of the Ministry: I endeavor to make up my mind to decline the duty, but, I cannot, I dare not; for whenever I attempt to bring myself to the conclusion that it would be better to give up those duties and to give myself wholly to those of the Press, I feel a something which I cannot describe—a something which reminds me of Paul’s expression, when he said, “Necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe is me if I preach not the Gospel.” At this time, too, for one acquainted with this place and people to be silent,—now that Rome is endeavoring to establish herself under our very windows—now that so many of our countrymen are settled here—would be a matter of joy to Satan. My Brethren, I only wish to be useful, but let me be useful to the full extent of my capacity for usefulness. Permit me to be faithful to what the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> has been pleased to entrust me with.—I have but a few years, at most, to run, (for, to borrow the phraseology of the world, “<hi rend="italic">Active </hi>exertion in N. Zealand will assuredly bring on premature old age.”) I have been, I trust, and may be (since it is the Committee’s wish that I should remain with the Press,) usefully employed in three ways, in Printing, Writing and Preaching, and those three duties <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be united in my remaining with the Press. I think, however, that I have fully shewn that the time has arrived, or if not so, is at hand, in which a Layman can not, consistently, be permitted <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>to take a share in spiritual labours; consequently, the only means by which I could continue to pursue those duties I have hitherto fulfilled would be by obtaining Ordination. If, Sirs and Brethren, it still be your wish that I should remain with the Press, grant me this, also, to enter into Orders, and I am settled in my work. By your permitting me to enter into Orders, I shall be lawfully enabled to assist the Minister of the Station in which I may reside, and thus fulfill a duty which I owe to my <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>. Here, I would say, that I wish it to be distinctly understood, that, in my remaining with the Press, under the abovementioned arrangement, I should ever consider the attending to the operations of the Press, (in a similar manner to what I have hitherto done) to be my primary charge and duty, as long as the Society should think proper to continue me in the said situation.</p>
      <p>5. I could here adduce many, very many reasons, why this should take place; Time, however, will not permit. One remark in passing, I would beg permission to make, and that is, <hi rend="italic">That all preachers should be Ordained Missionaries, and, That all should be first tried in the field of labour before they be admitted to the solemn and sacred office of the Ministry. </hi>Be not offended, with me, my dear Sirs, when I say, from what I have seen, and heard, and known, during more than 5 years of practical experience in the Mission Field, it is my decided opinion and firm conviction, that it is actually more needful for Missionary Students to be on probation in the Fields of Missionary Labour, than for them to be on trial within the walls of a College or Institution. A man may be able to compose a most excellent Discourse, he may write an elegant and classical Latin Essay, yea, he may pass his Greek Examination with ease and applause, and, yet, be very unfit for a Practical Missionary; and make, after all, but a very sorry figure in the field. This, however, is a digression, but, my dear Sirs, you have my free thoughts on this subject.</p>
      <p>6. You will, ere this, have heard from Mr. Wade, who, I believe, has made you acquainted with what he is thinking of doing. In his leaving N. Zealand, his situation of Superintendent of the Press will become vacant, and which situation, I suppose, you will not again fill up, at least, not by specially appointing an extra person to that office,—You will have heard from him about the Press—its present locality—the attempt to move it to the Kerikeri, &amp;c, &amp;c. With regard to the <hi rend="italic">place</hi> where the Press shall be stationed, allow me to say, that I think it is quite time that <hi rend="italic">that</hi> point be finally settled. Six years will nearly have rolled by, when this reaches you, and yet the Press,—the importance of which is admitted by all, and the beneficial influence of which is seen throughout the Land—stands in the little room, where it was first temporarily placed; still, in a great measure, inefficient, from being <hi rend="italic">unsettled</hi>. Much of the Types, which came from England, with us, in 1834, remain in the papers and Boxes in which they came, and the trouble I have had, in consequence of being in want of room, no one knows, <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>nor can imagine. The one little room in the Baker’s house, which has ever been occupied by the Press, being the only place hitherto used for compositing, roll-work, wetting paper, washing Types, &amp;c, &amp;c. Reasons there are for its being stationed at the Waimate, but, I think, there are weightier reasons now for its remaining at Paihia. 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>., Here is a stone building, fitted, when finished, (and which a few weeks would complete) for its reception: At that Station, there is no building, and the time that it would take to get one up (under existing circumstances) is, doubtless, very great. 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>., This Station is on the sea side close to the anchorage; a great part of the Books, &amp;c, would require to be shipped off for the Southward Stations, the nearness of this Station to the water is, therefore, a consideration: that Station, is some 10 or 12 miles from the head of the Kerikeri river, from whence, at least, all Materiel for printing, &amp;c, would have to be taken to the Waimate, and to which, all Books, &amp;c, must be again conveyed, in order to be sent to very nearly <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the other Stations; the road, too, in winter, is often impassable. I have little doubt myself, but that my Services in Spiritual duties, have been a Cause of why the Committee of Missionaries, wished Paihia to be the Station for the Printing Press.—Still, I think, it can hardly be doubted, but that Paihia will always be the principal Station of the C. Mission, in the N.D. of New Zealand; its natural situation being such as to demand and ensure the same. As to the Kerikeri Station, as a situation for the Press, <hi rend="italic">I </hi>could not, conscientiously, consent to be stationed there—for, I should not only have no one to preach to, but I should, probably, have no one to speak to, for days together.</p>
      <p>7. I suppose the Committee are aware, that the breaking up of the Kerikeri Station, has been for some time contemplated; and, I have little doubt but that it will soon be accomplished. It cannot, with propriety, I think, be called, a <hi rend="italic">Mission</hi> Station, for there is nothing within it to call for the labor of a Missionary; this, I think, will appear to be very plain on referring to the Chart now sent,—there being no Natives living within the Station, save the few Domestics of Mr. Kemp, and those 2 or 3 <hi rend="italic">little</hi> villages, on the coast, which are visited from it, are as near Tapuna and Wangaroa, (from which places they are also visited,) as they are to Kerikeri. And, even those Native Villages, will, like many others, soon become abandoned, the land having been just purchased by Europeans. Natives will not, (in fact, as they are they cannot) live on land which they have sold: so that a Tribe, which for years has been residing on the shores of this Bay, may, tomorrow, be found leaving for some other place on the coast, or some one of their possessions in the Interior, 10, 20 or 30 miles off. It has also been proposed to sell the Kerikeri Station, Lands, Houses, &amp; Store; this, I think, (indeed I have told the Brethren so) had better not be done just now; were those Houses <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, in the Bay, <hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>the present might be a desirable period for selling the same. I would humbly suggest that they should be offered to be Let by Tender, in 2 or 3 Lots, at an yearly rent, for a term of 7 or so years; but by no means to be sold privately (i.e. the Sale confined to the Body of Missionaries and, a rule similar to this, my dear Sirs, in my humble opinion, should be adopted relative to <hi rend="italic">all </hi>lands and Properties, of the C.M.S., which it may be deemed advisable to Let or Sell, in this Island. I thus speak, (though I may be deemed a meddler in the affairs of others,) from what I have seen, and heard, and in so speaking, I trust I am actuated by a single desire for the <hi rend="italic">welfare of the Society</hi>.</p>
      <p>8. I have heard, my dear Sirs, of your being about to appoint a Deputation to visit your Mission in N. Zealand. I hope, that ere this reaches you, some suitable person will have arrived here. Should such, however, not be the case, I sincerely trust that no time will be lost in sending out a person of sound judgement and experience, as well as of piety, to enter on this office—a person who will not take any thing for granted because such-a-one said it, but who will examine for himself. I forebear saying any thing more, at present, on this subject, save, that it is my humble opinion, that the sooner such an Inquiry is entered into the better for the Society as well as the Mission.</p>
      <p>9. There are a few things connected with the Press, which I would here beg to make known to the Committee, for their Information, and for future guidance. 1. Whether it is the Society’s wish that their Press should be employed in printing for the Officers, who may be appointed by the British Government to N. Zealand? supposing such to be by them required. 2. Whether it is the Society’s desire that Public work generally—at least as far as it may be practicable—should be executed at their Press? Many times already, have I been applied to, on this head; I think, myself, that for the present, this should not be done at the Press of the C.M.S. 3. Whether the Society would not always grant the printing of Religious Tracts, and other works of a Religious and useful nature, for the N. Zealanders, at their Press, without having, in every case, to apply to the Committee of Missionaries here? I ask this, because some of the Missionaries are opposed to any Tracts whatever being printed, and, because, that, very lately, the Committee of Missionaries refused the Auxiliary Tract Society permission to print a Tract of 24 pp., against Errors of Popery, at their Press, although the Committee of the Auxiliary Tract Society, who had read and approved of the Tract proposed, was partly comprised of Missionaries.</p>
      <p>10. I think, myself, that the Press should have some representative in the Committee of Missionaries here; otherwise it will never have that efficiency which it requires, in order that it may be always and usefully employed. Your Committee were pleased to order that I should not sit in Committees here,—for which, (as far as I, <hi rend="italic">privately</hi>, am concerned,) I would most sincerely thank them; only wishing that some other reason had been assigned than that of being called away from the <hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>duties of the Printing Office—for every year I spend many weeks in travelling among the Natives, without interfering with those duties. The Committee of Missionaries finding, that I was excluded from Home, found a reason for the excluding of Mr Wade also, which they have ever done to this day. It is a sad, yea, a very sad theme for reflection, when I think on the apathetic indifference shewn towards what is, at present, of the very first Importance in N. Zealand—i.e. The Press. No one seems to care to <hi rend="italic">do </hi>any thing for it, or towards the making it more efficient; here, however, Justice calls upon me to remark: that it is not in the power of everyone to aid its exertions—in one thing only there appears to be alacrity shewn, and that is in the taking up of Books, when finished, for distribution.—</p>
      <p>11. I don’t know, my brethren, whether you have thought it proper to seek for a Printer for your Pg. Office in N. Zealand; or, whether such a person has been directed by the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> to you or not. But should such a person be sent out by you, at any future period, allow me, I pray you, to suggest that he be, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, a married man, <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, that he be appointed at a salary from your Committee, without any allowances whatever for contingencies, and, <hi rend="italic">third</hi>, that he have nothing to do in preaching, teaching, giving out medicine, or in any thing else, but to attend to his duties in the Printing-office. </p>
      <p>12. Enclosed, in the small parcel of Books, which go by this Ship, you will find a return of the work done at your printing press in N. Zealand, from the commencement in 1835, to the present time, which, I trust, will prove satisfactory. The Edition of 5000 Testaments, you will perceive to be fast expending. I have heard that it is proposed by the Committee of Missionaries, that the next Edition be printed in England. I cannot say when the large Prayer Book will be finished as I have but a very small quantity of Copy by me, and I know not when I will receive any more. I understand, however, that the Psalms are translated, perhaps in a few days they will be placed in my hands.—</p>
      <p>13. I suppose that the other Missionaries will inform you of what more especially falls under their Notice.—</p>
      <p>14. The Romish Bishop has received a reinforcement of five priests, at present they are pretty quiet, and doing but little, but I have no doubt but that they will be soon actively employed. Would that Luther’s example had been followed and the Press usefully and actively employed against them! I heard the Popish Bishop address a young man, who the night previous had murdered and buried a woman, and, also, wounded a man very badly; saying, “<hi rend="italic">Me inoi koe a Mata Maria ma te ripeneta</hi>;”—literally,<hi rend="italic"> </hi>
      <hi rend="bold">[9] </hi>“And pray thou to the Mother Maria for the repentance”! I send you, in the parcel, one of the R.C. Bishop’s Books, which, though not Native, I dare say, Mr. Knight; if he can decipher the same, and is still in your office, may be able to translate. Time won’t permit my doing so; but I here give a literal translation of the concluding prayer on the 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. page. “Hail! praise to thee; O Maria filled with grace; with thee the God; thou amongst women art praised, [or blessed,] and Jesus, the fruit of thy womb, is praised [or blessed,] also. O Saint Maria, the mother parent of Jesus Christ our God, pray thou for us, a poor sinful people, today, and at the hour of <hi rend="underline italic">our</hi> death.” This last pronoun “<hi rend="italic">our</hi>” is the native word which includes the person or persons addressed—consequently Mary is thereby included.—This little Book now sent is the only one which the R.C. Bishop has got published; I doubt not, but that he is busily engaged in preparing others, for he is an active man.</p>
      <p>15. I beg to request permission of the Committee to allow me to visit England, in about 2 years hence; i.e. as near that time, (January 1842) as the work in the Printing Office and opportunity for going home may allow of my doing so. I make this request of mine known to the Committee of Missionaries, now about to sit, together with that which I have herein made of being admitted to Orders, that they may report their opinion thereon.</p>
      <p>16. I send you pr. this vessel, the “Matilda,” enclosed in a parcel, the following Books:—<lb/>10 small prayer Books   10 Primers<lb/>6 Bishop’s address               6 Class Books<lb/>4 Lessons                             10 Catechisms, (first sheet)<lb/>6 Tracts                               3 half sheets large pr. Book; sig E<lb/>Sundry notices of               Chart of Paihia District<lb/>Victorian Institutions,<lb/>Return of Books, printed       1 of Popish Bishop’s Books.</p>
      <p>17. Since the foregoing was written, H.M.S. “Herald,” has arrived, came in the Bay and anchored, on the morning of the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Jany. (bringing Lieut. Governor Hobson and suite. His Excellency has issued 2 Proclamations, (copies of which are enclosed in the parcel of Books, &amp;c,)—has assembled together some of the Chiefs at Waitangi, and has got some to sign the Treaty. The Principal Articles of the Treaty are, 1. The Cession of the Sovereignty of their respective Tribes to the Queen of Great Britain. 2. Their consenting to sell their Lands only through the person appointed by the Government. 3. Their being entitled to the Rights of British Subjects, on their Signing the Treaty. Forty five Chiefs signed the document, several refused to do so; there are not many Chiefs of the first rank among those who have signed. This morning (Monday, Feb. 11.) His Excellency went to Waimate, and tomorrow he goes on to Hokianga; and in a few days to the Southward, in the “Herald,” to Issue his Proclamation, and to get the Natives <hi rend="bold">[10] </hi>to sign the Treaty. I have little doubt, myself, but that the Natives will come forwards ready enough to sign the same, at the same time, I believe it will be from ignorance of the Articles. [Last week 2 persons, baptized, in the Hokianga district, quarrelled, when one cleft the other’s face asunder with his axe, so that he died: and since that, in the same neighbourhood, a Chief of the Romish Bishop’s party, coolly and deliberately killed a man for the stealing of an handkerchief. Chiefs believe they have a right to do as they please with their slaves, and, for a false accusation, cursing, trespassing on sacred places, Sorcery, &amp;c, &amp;c, they are invariably punished with death—and often without Inquiry.] As to their being aware that by their signing the Treaty they have restrained themselves from Selling their Land to whomsoever they will; I cannot for a moment suppose that they can know it. A proof I can adduce; Hara, a chief of the second rank, in this neighbourhood, and one who wished the Treaty to be signed, and who came forward and signed the same, has since offered to sell his Lands, and, on the person, to whom he offered them, saying, “it was irregular, &amp;c, Hara replied, “What! do you think I won’t do as I like with my own?” I believed, and do believe, that the Natives did not fully understand what they signed: believing this, and finding no other person would, I took it upon me to address His Excellency, at the Public Meeting, when the first person was called up to append his Name to the Document. I asked His Excellency, whether His Excellency supposed that the Native Chiefs knew what they were about to do, &amp;c &amp;c. His Excellency, in reply, stated that he had done his best to enable them to understand the same, &amp;c, &amp;c,—I mention this circumstance, my dear Sirs, that in the event of a reaction taking place, you may know the very root from whence such a reaction proceeds.—It is also possible that you may hear of my having addressed His Excellency on this subject from another quarter. Interests are beginning to clash—beginning did I say? they have long since <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> to do so—and the <hi rend="italic">dearest</hi> must be supported. Oh! how thankful should I be to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>, (though I sometimes feel my poverty,) that <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> has kept me from becoming possessed of Land, and, by that means seeking my own welfare before that of my Redeemer, the Society, or the poor New Zealander! I must be enabled to send you <hi rend="italic">speedily</hi> an account of the Meeting, from notes taken by myself on the spot: But have not time at present to fill out the same, and be given the requisite Information.—</p>
      <p>18. You will see, my dear Sirs, that what I supposed, in Par. 4, would soon come to pass, has, since my writing, of the same, approached much nearer to consummation. N. Zealand being annexed to N.S. Wales as part &amp; parcel of the same, the Bishop of Australia is now our Diocesan, and I believe, that I may safely say, that His Lordship would never allow such a departure from the discipline of our Church to take place, as for a Layman to stand up in a pulpit, in that church or chapel belonging to the Church of England in his Diocese—at least not in the neighbourhood of the Bay of Islands, the Capital of New Zealand.<hi rend="bold">[11] </hi>I pray you, therefore, my dear Sirs, to take my prayer herein made into your most serious consideration</p>
      <p>19. I am much concerned, my dear Sirs, at the enormous expenses yearly incurred by this Mission.—As an Individual causing a portion of the same, I may, perhaps, be permitted to offer my opinion thereon. Three years since I proposed to the Brethren here that they should take the subject effectually into consideration. From that time to the present I have thought of and spoken on the greatness of the expenditure, very many times: and, now, I venture to send you my thoughts on the same. I think, my dear Sirs, that if each individual in your employ was paid direct from Home, <hi rend="italic">in one yearly Sum</hi>, without any allowance for personal contingencies, (so to speak) a saving of some hundreds pr. ann. would accrue therefrom to the Society. At present there is hardly an article in common use which may not be easily obtained at one or other of the many Stores in the Bay of Islands. Even were it otherwise, the Missionaries continually send to England for many things on private account, and why not send for all? supposing such to be necessary. Again, Slop Clothing, &amp;c, are daily getting into disuse as articles of trade with the Natives. Cash, in the shape of Gold or Silver, is what the Natives now seek after. European Garments of the first-rate quality are the commodities that meet with a <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> Sale. I am often surprised at seeing the shew of Dresses on the Lord’s-Day; and cannot help sometimes contrasting my own appearance with theirs: I have seen Natives with a new and complete handsome Dress at Morning Service, and with a different new dress at Evening Service, on the same day. For my own part, I believe, that whilst the Kerikeri Store remains a Depôt for Goods, the Expenditure of your Mission in this Land will not be materially lessened. This, at first, may appear somewhat paradoxical, but so it is. There is, at present, a continual Drawing of one thing and the other from the Store, which, were they not to be had, or not to be obtained on Public Account, could, perhaps, be easily done without. Again our Vessel, the Columbine, might, in my humble opinion, be dispensed with: at present there are general vessels from the size of the Columbine downwards, trading to several ports and harbours in N. Zealand, to <hi rend="italic">all </hi>places where we have Stations; and their number is annually increasing. And, I think it will be seen in the last year’s accounts, that some hundreds of pounds have been expended in Shipping, exclusive of what the Columbine has cost. I don’t wish to say too much on these subjects, my dear Sirs,—yet, whilst I would remember that there is “a time to be silent,” I must, also, to do my duty, remember that there is “a time to speak”. I believe, that you will find, on referring to your accounts from N. Zealand, that our Society gains but little by their Farm at the Waimate; I speak in reference only to Profit gained by Farming. Now, the end for which that Farm was begun—believing that to be, to give the N. Zealanders an insight, &amp;c, into Farming,—is, in a certain degree, attained: besides, there are many Farms now in N. Zealand, where the Natives may, if so inclined, receive <hi rend="bold">[12] </hi>instruction in the Art of Farming. Would it not, my dear Sirs, be worth consideration, to Let the Farm, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, at a good yearly rent, whilst Land is much sought after and brings a good price, and to have a permanent yearly gain arising therefrom to the Society? I am firmly of opinion, that by thus dealing, with us with regard to Salaries,—by giving up the Farm, Letting the same, and selling the Cattle—your Committee would be enabled to effect a great annual saving in the expenditure of the New Zealand Mission.</p>
      <p>20. The following is the amount of Items which I yearly receive from the Society:—Self, Salary £30. Ration, £26.; 5 Lads, Clothing, &amp; Food £27.10– Total, £83-10-0 pr. annum. This is quite sufficient for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> person to live on in any other Station in N. Zealand, than in <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, be that person Clergy—or Layman; but in this Station that amount is <hi rend="italic">not </hi>sufficient; it has cost me more every year than my Income, which overplus has been supplied thro’ the liberality of my friends. Thus I don’t wish for a penny more from the Society, nay, I would much rather endeavor to do on less, and will, if there should ever be a necessity for my so doing.</p>
      <p>21. I have taken on myself to make the foregoing remarks; and now, I pray you, my dear Sirs, to pardon me in all that I have written here amiss; be assured, if such has been done by me in this Communication of mine, it has not been done intentionally. I have ever, hitherto, been silent on these matters, perhaps too fully so, and in my thus writing I have, I trust, been actuated solely by a wish to serve the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> and the C.M. Society; how much soever I may have failed in so doing. I am well aware that in several paragraphs of this Letter, the pronoun <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, may appear to be much too prominently and proudly placed, and perhaps, it is really so, yet I pray you, my dear Sirs, to take into consideration, that I had to write about myself, and that, too, in a very peculiar way; <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> I shrink from coming forward into Public notice but in a case like the present—a Cause which I believe to be Jehovah’s—a cause which has to be heard at the distance of several thousand miles from the scene of action—a cause, too, concerning which this is probably the last communication—I was desirous of <hi rend="italic">so </hi>writing, as, however much I might be misunderstood by others, to possess a clear conscience that I had done my duty in the matter in question. I hope, also, that the Importance of my present Letter, at least as far as regards myself, together with my 12 months’ silence, will be a sufficient apology for the very great length of this Communication.—</p>
      <p>22. Please pay my Father the Sum of £<hi rend="italic">36.1.6</hi>, charging the same to my account. It would be well perhaps for me here to remark, that the last account sent to me from the Society of £122.—Balance due to the Society was not actually due from me to them, though down in my name, but due for others here: this has since been properly arranged. Should Mr. Knight, <hi rend="bold">[13] </hi>whom I have requested to get me a few articles, apply to you for wherewith to obtain the same, please let him have what he may require, on my account. Probably a Mr. Rodda, of Penzance, may write to you for £3. or £4. on my account; be, pleased, also, to grant him the amount which he may request of you.</p>
      <p>23. I have sent by this vessel two small Boxes, directed to the care of Mr. Knight, for Sir W.J. Hooker, Regius Prof. of Botany, at Glasgow University, should Mr. K. not be at hand to take charge of them, will you be so kind as to have them received and forwarded by Steam as soon as convenient: they contain Botanical Specimens. I have written Sir William concerning the same.—</p>
      <p>May the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> direct you, my dear Sirs, in all things! May <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> lead the way, and grant us all Grace to follow—</p>
      <p>is the prayer of</p>
      <p>Your obliged and devoted Servant,</p>
      <p>William Colenso.</p>
      <p>P.S. By a Note just received from Mr. Busby, I find, that the allotments of land at his place, (referred to by me in par.1.) were sold by auction yesterday, when “27 Building allotments came to £982! about £422 pr. acre! From this you may form some idea of the value of Land, desirably situated in N. Zealand.—</p>
      <p>Feby. 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., Finally closed. Yesterday, much to my surprise, Mr John Flatt made his appearance in this Station! He arrived at Hokianga last week, and is come here expecting to get a situation under the Governor. What he intends doing, in case he does not succeed, I don’t know. He had some Conversation with His Excellency, while in Sydney, and from what passed between them at that meeting he is now come hither.</p>
