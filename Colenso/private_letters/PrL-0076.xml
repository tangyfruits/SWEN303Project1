         <p rend="end">In my tent, at Te Kopi,<lb/>Palliser Bay, N. Zealand,<lb/>Novr. 9, 1848.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs</p>
         <p>Having come thus far towards Wellington (in my usual spring journey among the Natives), and being about to send thither my Letters for England, among which is one to Messrs. Dixon &amp; Co., containing an order which I am desirous should be executed with as little delay as possible, and not having Bills on CMS. to an amount sufficient to meet the same, I am, in a measure, constrained to write you this note, to request you to pay to Messrs. R. Dixon &amp; Co., the sum of £50. (<hi rend="italic">Fifty pounds</hi>), on my account. I am aware that my so doing is somewhat irregular but I trust that my peculiar situation will be more than sufficient to account for my request. For, firstly, (as you know) our Bills are only drawn when our local Comee. meets, which is once an year (in January), and seldom or never in advance; consequently, at this time nearly a year’s salary has become due:—and, secondly, the necessary outlay made in forming this Station, and made by myself too out of my own stipend (and which I duly acquainted you with,) has not yet been repaid. I am, therefore, obliged either to wait 3 months, or to draw in this manner upon you.—</p>
         <p>The Natives are all very quiet in this District, and, considering all things, in as good a state as could be expected. I fear, however, before another 12 months have elapsed there will be a great alteration for the worse. For the white man is now seeking to settle every where—even in the wilds about Ahuriri—and thus arousing the cupidity of the Natives. The Government too wishes “to purchase the <hi rend="underline italic">whole</hi> of the Country from Wairarapa to Ahuriri”! which, if done, will certainly seal the Natives’ ruin; for, unless their “<hi rend="italic">reserve</hi>” is in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> block, and <hi rend="italic">at a distance from</hi> the white, I can not see any chance of their escaping the hitherto common fate of all aborigines with whom the white has come in contact.</p>
         <p>In great haste</p>
         <p>(and surrounded by Natives)</p>
         <p>I am, my dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>very sincerely yours</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Novr. 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., midnight.</p>
         <p>Late this evening, Rev. Mr. Cole arrived from Wellington, bringing me 2 Letters—one from the Col. Secretary &amp; one from the Govr.—wishing me to cooperate in getting the <hi rend="italic">whole </hi>of this District from the Natives!! May the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> guide me in this matter! Amen.</p>
