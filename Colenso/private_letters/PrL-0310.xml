         <p rend="end">Monday night</p>
         <p>My dear Sir Donald</p>
         <p>I am very much obliged to you for your very kind invitation to dine with you tomorrow—which I would with great pleasure accept:—but I am <hi rend="italic">in a fix</hi>!—</p>
         <p>My two servants, man &amp; wife, are members of Rev. Mr. Redstone’s Congregation and of <hi rend="italic">that Church</hi> (U.M.)­­ and I had given them leave to go to the great and <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Tea Meeting tomorrow evening; I (of course) staying at home: as it is <hi rend="italic">needful</hi> now-a-days for some one to be in the house of nights. Well, the man is quite (?) willing to stay at home, but the wife (a <hi rend="italic">good servant</hi> though timid creature, who has only been a short time in N.Z.,) won’t go out <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> to town of an evening:—of course, both would remain at home for me to go out if I were to ask, or press it,—but I don’t exactly like this, under <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the circumstances (their being greatly attached to Mr. R., who is also a Countryman of theirs,) and they have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> had a holiday to the Races.</p>
         <p>So, my Dear Sir Donald, I am <hi rend="italic">reluctantly</hi> obliged to decline this kind invitation of yours—and, in doing so, would ask you to <hi rend="italic">renew</hi> it—for some other day when you may be free from engagement, and to afford me that pleasure.—</p>
         <p>I purpose calling on you at your office on Wednesday morning.</p>
         <p>     I am</p>
         <p>             Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
