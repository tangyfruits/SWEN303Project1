         <p>Dear Mr. McLean</p>
         <p>I have just received your note with the printed form to be filled up.—</p>
         <p>The “form” appears to me to be an uncommonly curious one (to say the least of it),—in your accompanying note you speak of the “<hi rend="italic">European</hi> population”—the form has a column headed “Race”—&amp; another headed “sex”!! <hi rend="underline italic">after</hi> the European <hi rend="italic">name </hi>of the person!!</p>
         <p>As I do not know how many head of cattle there are, ditto goats—I am obliged to leave the filling it up until Monday—the live stock being absent &amp; my lads at Ahuriri, getting the goods which came by “Rose.”—</p>
         <p>Of course it is <hi rend="italic">utterly impossible</hi> that I could fill up a sheet for Mr. Hamlin—I do not even know the no. of his family.</p>
         <p>Had we known that you were still at Ahuriri, we should have sent you a basket of Lettuces.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>very truly yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
