         <p>Mr J. Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>In accordance to my promise to you I went to town yes­terday and saw Mr Lyndon.­</p>
         <p>We had a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> talk over the matter, as he had to make several en­quiries of me (owing to the very bad name of the last Auction transaction, &amp;c, &amp;c) he told me, that <hi rend="italic">I was greatly blamed by all the bu­siness men for not attending that sale, and protecting myself;</hi> he par­ticularly wanted to know if R had anything to do with it (the borrow­ing), and, also, if I were not going to follow it up; I said, “No, cer­tainly not, as against <hi rend="italic">you</hi>”.</p>
         <p>For some time he seemed doubtful, (but only as <hi rend="italic">all</hi> agents and Money lenders would be <hi rend="italic">on</hi> Mortgages, viz, <hi rend="italic">never lend beyond ½ or so, of its value or cost,</hi>) and this being conveyed (say) to you for the sum requi­red on Mortgage;—however, he is going to see it in a day or two, &amp; I shall see him again. I wished to get £500 for you.</p>
         <p rend="center">——————————</p>
         <p>Should Mr Lyndon <hi rend="italic">not</hi> agree to lend you the £500—then, I have the following proposal to make, which has since occurred to me. It part­ly arose in my mind, from what you told me on our <hi rend="italic">second meeting</hi>, viz, (1) that the money would not be required until the <hi rend="italic">end of the year</hi>; and (2) that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> greatly preferred <hi rend="italic">my entering into the matter</hi>.—So as to</p>
