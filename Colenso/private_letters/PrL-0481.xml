         <p>Napier Feb 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> 1882</p>
         <p>Mr J. Drummond </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your kind &amp; welcome &amp; pleasing letter of 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Jan I have received, and I must not allow this Mail to return to you without a line. I cannot however <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> answer it at <hi rend="italic">present</hi>
            <hi rend="underline">,</hi> but hope to do so shortly’.­</p>
         <p>I am engaged in preparing for our <hi rend="italic">Annual</hi> Meeting next Monday―­in getting out report, ―Statement of Accounts, &amp;c, &amp;c, ―not a small extra matter with me (just now, and for a week past) is the <hi rend="italic">seeking </hi>after a few <hi rend="italic">more</hi> members, ―for being now 78 years old, I wish our­ Society to top up <hi rend="italic">to 100</hi>―or<hi rend="sup">,</hi>over, &amp; I<hi rend="italic"> </hi>think I shall do it; ―I should have written to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to help, in this new move, but I feared you had none in your neighbourhood who would care to join. Messrs Herrick &amp; Bridge should however do so―or, rather should<hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">have done</hi> so years ago.</p>
         <p>Do not think for a moment I have lost sight of you, or of your<hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">work</hi>―no, no, not so; I duly received your box of specimens and again thank you; the one thing in particular among the lot which I was plea­sed to see, was a little stout bodied thick moth with<hi rend="italic"> </hi>four peculiar hairy wings; I jumped w. joy when I saw it (You will understand me). Two years ago I had two very similar ones brought me from the town, by a young Carpenter who had found them on a sheet left out all night, only those were <hi rend="italic">green</hi> &amp; smooth, and a <hi rend="italic">trifle</hi> larger; well, I was pleased with them, both being <hi rend="italic">new</hi> to me, &amp; lost no time in sen­ding them in a tin box to X.Church, to a first class Butterfly Ento­mologist there, w. a letter also―I waited several, months, at last, not hearing, I wrote, &amp; judge my vexation to find he had <hi rend="italic">never received them</hi>!! Now then, from you I have another (of the­ same Genus, though not species) &amp; strange to say, I have <hi rend="italic">since</hi> yours came to hand, captured <hi rend="italic">one asleep</hi> here on the weather-boarding of this house &amp; near my door!!―so I am in luck; ―a long-legged spider too, in your lot is another prize; I should like more of both of these―but all you sent were very acceptable. The Dragon-fly is a very fine one, this was described nearly 40 years ago, &amp; bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Petalura Carovei</hi>―while a very tender bodied kind of Dragon­fly, with light blue markings, bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Lestea Colensonis </hi>(this kind keeps its wings <hi rend="italic">closed</hi> up when resting on a leaf or tree)―both sorts were published together.</p>
         <p>I note you put 4d on your box―when 1d stamp would have done. All parcels<hi rend="sup"> </hi>are ½d an oz, 1d―2ozs &amp;c, and the long legged spider had only<hi rend="italic"> </hi>a few legs left, <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">are needful</hi>―on the specimen, if pos­sible, but if broken off, still send them.</p>
         <p>By this mail I send you a book (Vol I Transactions N.Z.I.) which please accept <hi rend="italic">from me</hi>. I had sent to Wellington for it, &amp; had it some days ago, intending it as a New Year gift―I ought to have sent it <hi rend="italic">before</hi>. Excuse this.</p>
         <p>For some time past I have had a great desire to get this Book for you (as you like to read my writings) ―because it contains my 2 Essays, written for the Imperial Commissioners, &amp; the one “on the Maoris” they made (out of a lot) <hi rend="italic">the Prize Essay,</hi> &amp; though I did it in hot haste (because I had done my <hi rend="italic">allotted</hi> share in the one “on the Botany of the N. Island”), it is, perhaps, the best &amp; <hi rend="italic">truest</hi> of any of the many books written on the subject; ―it is something like “Liebeigs Extract of Beef” ―it needs <hi rend="italic">diluting</hi>. ―I may tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, there was a great noise made over it when published, and the Govt were obliged to <hi rend="italic">reprint</hi> the Volume (I) there was such a demand for it. You may like to take care of it for Willie (namesake).</p>
         <p>I have a little more to remind me of Ongaonga―1, a note from Miss Smith, ―2, a visit from her brother (who was here for a fortnight), who told me of his brother liking your business, of your being all well, and (though others were badly off for water) <hi rend="italic">you </hi>were well off, having a good well, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>As to your subscribing to that little new Work at Dunedin, perhaps you had better (now) do as you say, tear off the slip and with your name and address send it to the publishers. I sent off my lot (of 3) last week―which had been sent to me from country places, instead of to the publishers. I know nothing as to <hi rend="italic">when </hi>the Subn. will have to be paid; I noted, they had <hi rend="italic">not </hi>stated that; let us wait till asked for. The Circulars (nearly 100) were sent to me, stamped &amp; wrapped, to send out; I having been previously asked if I would do so.</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">great </hi>question in your last I will answer by-and-bye; I am glad to see <hi rend="italic">your mind </hi>moving in such matters; but more anon. I am greatly tempted to go on with “Tracts for the Times”―No 2, &amp;c―but ―  ―  ―</p>
         <p>Now I must close; I have set aside several others for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. With kind regards to Mrs Drummond and to yourself―and lots of love to namesake,</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
         <p>Wm Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. I would that you were nearer me to have some peaches, though they are very small this year,―on this dry hill. I will send you a paper (D.V.) of our Annual Meeting next week.</p>
