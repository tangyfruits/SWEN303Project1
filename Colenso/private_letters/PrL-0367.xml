         <p rend="end">Napier, November 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.<lb/>1878.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Thanks for your kind note of 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. received yesterday, and for all the information therein.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> the 2 worms: you surprise me in saying, they are <hi rend="italic">Gondius aquaticus</hi>. I have long known that filiform hair-like species (and have had several specimens), white, in colour, not thicker than a thread and of a uniform thickness throughout, 10–20 in. long: <hi rend="italic">these</hi> widely differ <hi rend="italic">in appearance</hi>,—also with Cuvier’s descript., and with plate of <hi rend="italic">G. aquaticus </hi>in Rees’ Cyclopædia:—still, as you say, “they are <hi rend="italic">males</hi>,” you may be wholly right.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re </hi>the Marine spider;—its habitat, &amp;c. I captured it in 1836–7, at the little islet directly off Paihia (Mission Station) Bay of Islands; there are 3 islets lying off that place, and this is the smallest &amp; central one. I was there in my little boat (fishing or collecting shells), the day was calm &amp; water smooth, and in looking down from the stern, I saw in the deep water (3–6 feet) and tolerably steep rocky bottom, some of those spiders! they moved about, through the water, without difficulty, and seemed as if they each were enveloped in a small bubble of air: I watched them for some time, and I noticed they had holes or crevices in the rock under low-water mark into which they went: indeed, this specimen, I sent to you, I got out of its crevice or home. Not being supplied on that occasion with any proper means of obtaining them, I put it off for a season, and never afterwards found time (<hi rend="italic">through overmuch work</hi>) to go there again for that purpose. It was meeting with your account of the Marine Spider from Cape Campbell, in vol. x. “Trans.”, that brought this one to mind—after 42 years!! and it was just the only small zoological specimen I had ever put up by itself—in a small glass tube. No doubt there are plenty <hi rend="italic">there</hi> still.</p>
         <p>Sturm tells me, that Marine Spiders are also to be found at Waikokopu in this Bay,—N. extremity.—</p>
         <p>Apropos of Spiders:—I have a splendid specimen for you, only caught here 3 days ago. I have, however, long known it, (20 years ro so,) yet only casually coming on one or two, once in 2–3 years, and then, generally, inside of inverted empty flowerpots in the garden.</p>
         <p>In looking over yesterday Rev. O.P. Cambridge’s interesting account of 2 N.Z. spiders, (N.Z.I. “Trans.”, vol. vi. p.117,)—which, I confess, I ought to have read <hi rend="italic">before</hi>,—I think this must be a species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Macrothele</hi>, as, in certain points, it agrees with <hi rend="italic">M. Huttonii</hi>, described there by him,—although it is much larger, and is of a different colour, &amp;c, &amp;c.,—but this specimen may prove to be a <hi rend="italic">fem</hi>. (the fig. in Cambridge’s pl. is that of a <hi rend="italic">male</hi>,—which is always smaller, &amp;c.,)—<hi rend="italic">all</hi> the specimens I have ever had of this spider have been quite as large as this one: I will send it to you shortly. I would now at once, but I have been hunting-up a specimen or two of a <hi rend="italic">most peculiar</hi> black spider I used to find in the earth at the base of the Ruahine: but, at present, I cannot lay my hand on <hi rend="italic">that travelling bottle.</hi> Of this species I had captured (at various times) several specimens; of which I must have sent some to England, (and, probably, to the Linn. Socy.,) some 25–30 years ago. This spider is particularly mentioned by me in my Paper (part I.) Ruahine Journey, &amp;c.,—which I lately sent you. I must endeavor to find you specimens of this <hi rend="italic">most unique</hi> looking fellow.</p>
         <p>I have also to thank you for this Part (containing I and II) of Buchanan’s “Grasses,”—now to hand. I fear, however, you <hi rend="italic">have deprived yourself</hi> of it.—You say— “Of course you have a copy yourself”: I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> until I received this from you. And, allow me to add,—that I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write for one <hi rend="italic">for myself</hi>,—neither should I have mentioned it but for Mr. Nairn’s letter, requesting me to obtain him a copy, as he did not know where to apply (neither did I, correctly). I now enclose a note to the Govt. Printer, which (if <hi rend="italic">all right</hi>) please pass-on.</p>
         <p>I have not yet seen the Maori Chief (<hi rend="italic">tohunga</hi>) from whom I am to obtain that particular Maori information I require, &amp; mentioned by me in a former letter,—so I still retain that Paper: but I hope to see him <hi rend="italic">shortly</hi>, when you shall hear from me again.</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>my Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Do you find <hi rend="italic">Methylated</hi> Sp. of Wine to answer equally as well as the pure Sp. for specimens? Sp. of W., <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, is dreadfully <hi rend="italic">dear</hi>: the <hi rend="italic">Methyd.</hi> article is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so. If you get your Sp. of W. from home by the gallon &amp; <hi rend="italic">duty free</hi>—could <hi rend="italic">you spare any for specimens for the museum.</hi>
