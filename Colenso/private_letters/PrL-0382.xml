         <p rend="end">Napier, February 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, 1879</p>
         <p>Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I wrote to you on the 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. instant, which letter you will receive this evening. I now follow with this;—and, also, an Official one enclosed herewith: and, also, a cutting from this morning’s Paper <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the same.<note xml:id="ftn3-4" place="foot" n="4"> The <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> of 4 February reported the HBPI meeting: “A resolution was at length drawn up by the Chairman to the effect ‘that in the opinion of the meeting the personal narrative in Mr Colenso’s papers is a record of great interest as a narrative of exploration in the early days of the colony; that this meeting fully endorse Mr Colenso's protest, and trust that the proposal in his reply to Dr. Hector sent this day will be accepted.’ This resolution was carried unanimously.”</note>
         </p>
         <p>As the Reporter says, there was “considerable discussion” anent the affair; much more than I had anticipated. I have scarcely ever seen our Meeting so lively, insomuch that the Chairman himself, finally drew up the Resolution. At first I had only touched on it, in reading the “Report,” but I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> by degrees, and in answer to enquiries, to tell pretty nearly all that has passed between us. And, just as I had pointed out to you in my letter of the 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>, the opinions were mooted of the value (?) of those compilations of hard names,—given in the volumes of the “Transactions” by Kirk, Hutton, Fereday, and others,—<hi rend="italic">to “present </hi>N.Z.<hi rend="italic">”</hi>; of <hi rend="italic">those </hi>pages, remaining uncut, &amp;c., &amp;c. And, as one naively put it, suppose Dr. H., or Mr.——, had made <hi rend="underline italic">the only</hi> passage across the mountains in the Middle Island, would not that, however long, have been gladly received &amp; printed, &amp;c. What is now common there, is still uncommon here, &amp;c.—At all events the Meeting was ready to subscribe, (it was proposed to vote money out of our funds,) for the printing of the said Mss. here. Indeed, I may tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, that it was the <hi rend="italic">noise </hi>of <hi rend="italic">those Papers</hi>, and those from Hawke’s Bay in vol. x., that has gained us 11 additional Members.—</p>
         <p>Dr. Spencer spoke nicely,—serving to calm the Meeting,—that he considered from what I had told them the whole matter was still <hi rend="italic">sub judice</hi>, and that you would, no doubt, consent to my proposals. Which I hope you may do; and, I think, <hi rend="italic">the better way </hi>is for you to send me back the said Mss. <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>, and I will see what I can do in reducing them a little. You, <hi rend="italic">if you have time</hi>, marking here &amp; there in the margins,—or, if you have <hi rend="italic">not </hi>time, just say, roughly, how many pages of Ms. <hi rend="italic">less </hi>it should be to suit you. You can have the Papers returned <hi rend="italic">within a week</hi>: <hi rend="italic">i.e. </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">if to be returned</hi>, (as I said, in my last letter).</p>
         <p>Last night I looked at your own bye-laws (p. xii.), and while I find (which I knew &amp; never disputed) you rightly have power to reject papers, you have none for curtailing them. Besides (under <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) I find you are empowered “to require from us a proportional contribution,” which, I think, fully meets this case, and would be complied with. I did not know of this at our meeting yesterday.</p>
         <p>Let me hear from you <hi rend="italic">early</hi> by telegram, (if only a line, to be followed by a letter, or Mss.,) as I have arranged for going inland to the forests; but would put it off if needed.—</p>
         <p>I venture to think, that had your Directors proposed to reject or curtail <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the other Papers hence this season, there would have been little or nothing said about it; but <hi rend="italic">this</hi>—Ruahine Journey which I have for many years been importuned to write, and even to <hi rend="italic">re-read those said Papers</hi>, as I informed you,) is a <hi rend="italic">popular </hi>matter.</p>
         <p>I am, yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
