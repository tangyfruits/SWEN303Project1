         <p>Mr. John Burtton<lb/>Kumeroa</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I write to thank you for your kind note of the 12<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst., and for a deformed Huia’s bill that came with it:<note xml:id="ftn3-349" place="foot" n="349"> The subject of Colenso’s 1886 paper, A Description of the curiously-deformed Bill of a Huia, (<hi rend="italic">Heteralocha acutirostris</hi>, Gould), an endemic New Zealand Bird. <hi rend="italic">Trans NZ Inst</hi>. 19:140–145.</note> both very kindly brought me by your daughter Miss Burtton. The bill is (as you truly observe) a natural curiosity; and I shall have much pleasure in showing it, as from you, at an early meeting of our N.Z. Institute.—</p>
         <p>As you have so kindly and spontaneously remembered me with this curiosity, perhaps you may hereafter be able to send me something more in the shape of novelty,—from among the insects, the mosses and ferns, and small plants, shrubs and trees, that are peculiar to your neighbourhood,—a small portion (as a specimen) of anything <hi rend="italic">large </hi>will do: for I am a strong believer in the local Natural History of this Country, particularly of its Botany; and have often of late years, wished that age would allow me to visit and <hi rend="italic">explore</hi> the outlying Inland districts,—especially those near to the mountains.</p>
         <p>I note, in the “Postal Guide,” that you have a mail twice a week to and from Woodville: and so I enclose a few p. stamps, to enable you to use the said mail to advantage, should you detect any of those novelties:—as I suppose you scarcely can have stamps for sale at Kumeroa,—and I have several kind correspondents in scattered Country localities who do so.</p>
         <p>Once more thanking you for your kindness,</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
