         <p rend="end">Paihia, Bay of Islands, New Zealand,<lb/>April 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>., 1842.</p>
         <p>Secretaries,<lb/>C.M. House,<lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>1. The “Mandarin” being about to sail for Calcutta, affords an opportunity of forwarding letters for England, via that port. My last letter to you was dated Novr. 17/41, with which I also forwarded a small parcel of Books.</p>
         <p>2. When I last wrote, I was about proceeding to the East Cape and neighbourhood. Accordingly I left this Station on the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of November, and returned again on the 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. February. I am copying out my Journal at intervals, and hope to send it home in a few weeks.—</p>
         <p>3. The Paper, and other printing Stores per “Mandarin,” have been received all in good condition. I am very sure that we ought to be thankful for the abundant supply so kindly and promptly granted us.—</p>
         <p>4. The Natives about us, have been, and are at present, in a very unsettled state. On the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of November last (as I suppose you have already been informed,) a barbarous murder was committed on Mrs. Roberton, (the widow of a Capt. R., who was drowned here a short time ago,) three children, and her Servant, a man of Colour. They resided alone on one of the small islets in the outer part of this bay. It was soon traced to a young chief, named, <hi rend="italic">Maketu</hi>, who had long borne a bad character. He was speedily apprehended, examined, and sent to Auckland gaol; and tried and executed, at that place, about 3 weeks ago. As might have been expected, it has caused a great deal of commotion among the Natives. A plan was talked of as being concocting by them, to make a simultaneous rise and murder every white. Several hundred Natives, all armed, have assembled in this Station. As yet, however, no violence has been offered, and I would hope that peace may be preserved. In February last, a baptized Native, employed on the Revd. H. Williams’ farm, murdered his companion in cold blood! What made the matter worse (if possible) was the circumstance of Mr. Williams being there at the time, and the poor creature, who was murdered, had been brought up, along with his murderer, from childhood in this Station, and in <hi rend="italic">one house</hi>! Alleged connexion with his wife (another baptized Native;) was the ostensible cause of his committing the dreadful deed. The offender was soon lodged in gaol, where, however, he remained but a very short while, for the Magistrate, hearing that the Natives intended to rescue him by force, liberated him. One teacher has probably proclaimed Mr. H. Williams to be <hi rend="italic">Judas</hi>! Another has said, “We can do now without a white Missionary.” Another has torn up his Testament, <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>and that, too, just after receiving the Sacrament. Another has stuck up a notice at his place that the faith is, by him, cast aside. Another has declared that he will be (re-) baptized by the Romish priest; while others are falling through adultery, robbery, &amp;c.—A party headed by <hi rend="italic">Te Tirarau</hi>, one of the most powerful chiefs of the N.D., has been to Kaipara, and plundered and burnt to the ground the house, store, &amp;c, of a Mr. Forsyth, a Settler there; the alleged cause is, that Mr.F. had been to some one of their burying places and taken skulls and bones away with him; which charge is, I believe, in part, at least, correct. This party has since been to Wangarei, on the Eastern Coast, and have taken away (report says) ₤200. worth of property from the Settlers there. The cause in this case, was the selling, by the <hi rend="italic">Wangarei</hi> Chiefs, of a piece of land to some whites, which land was “<hi rend="italic">tapu</hi>”, (i.e., hallowed, reserved,) in consequence of a sister of <hi rend="italic">Te Tirarau </hi>having been killed, roasted and devoured on it, a few years ago by the <hi rend="italic">Ngatimau</hi> tribes. Both of these Cases are now about being investigated by the Government. I would fain hope that the worst is past, but, I fear that it will not prove to be so. I have long ago seen enough to lead me to expect a day of reaction, and, therefore, while grieved at such a deplorable state of things, <hi rend="italic">I </hi>am not taken by surprise by them. Sifting times generally prove, I think, times of blessing to <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> people; and I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that “the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> knowest them that are his,” and that He will keep them in the day of His anger; yet, where <hi rend="italic">such</hi> are in New Zealand I cannot say. Still, I would hope that He has a <hi rend="italic">hidden</hi> little flock even here. <hi rend="italic">Maketu</hi>, was baptized by the Rev. — Churton, previous to his execution. Poor creature! he spent his days, while in prison, in a very light and careless manner, singing native songs, &amp;c; I fear he did not know much of the state of mind requisite for receiving the Sacrament of Baptism. Mr. Churton, too, could know but little of the man, or the New Zealand language.—</p>
         <p>5. I very much regret that the parcel of Books sent by me to the “Mars” whaler for you, should have been by <hi rend="italic">them </hi>put in the Mail-bag, and so have cost the Society ₤7.12.0. As I have sent 2 or 3 parcels since I fear that you have had further and similar demands. For the future, however, I must endeavour to arrange matters better, and make up my packages in a little box.</p>
         <p>6. His Lordship the Bishop of New Zealand, has not yet arrived; we are looking out every day rather anxiously for somewhat of him.—<hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>
         </p>
         <p>7. I take the liberty to enclose a Letter addressed to Mr. Bates, as it contains money, in a draft on you, for ₤30.</p>
         <p>Hoping to write you again, my dear Sirs, very shortly.—And, desiring a continuance of your prayers for us—that we may, in these peculiar times, be blessed with a share of the serpent’s wisdom combined with the dove’s harmlessness.—</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>my dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>Ever most truly and obediently yours,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
