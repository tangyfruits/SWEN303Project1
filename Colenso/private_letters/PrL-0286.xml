         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Tuesday Feby 16</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>When <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are to <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> again (at the rate we have been going on since your return from Wellington) I really don’t know!—Now this is just what I have often thought of late—and what I should still be thinking (seeing I have called at your office—five or six times—never yet once met you in Town—and have lately heard of your being unwell &amp; confined to your house a little more than usual,) but for the events of last evening which <hi rend="italic">force</hi> me to pay <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a formal visit on Friday next,—and I should be most unwilling that such should be our first interview, or correspondence, after so long a silence, hence I scribble you this as a kind of <hi rend="italic">karere</hi>.</p>
         <p>I may tell you that I arranged for the Deputation to wait on you on <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>—as I saw it was too late for the “Herald” of this morning to give you any report of the meeting—and the “Times” would not be out before Thursday—and I thought it right you should have a fair public Report of the meeting <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that we saw you.—</p>
         <p>No doubt you heard (some 2 months or more ago) that a Public Meeting was then sought to be convened to consider this question: a paper signed by (I believe) 98 respectable Rate payers of this Town was brought to me by a Deputation chosen from among themselves asking me to convene such a meeting: I refused however to do so, mainly on the ground that I held no Po. situation nor any Public one,—that I was more retired than half of my fellow townsmen, &amp;c, &amp;c: they gave in very <hi rend="italic">reluctantly</hi>, and I promised them that if they got up a Public meeting that I would attend &amp; take part in it. Your re-appointing a Collector of this obnoxious rate, &amp; his going his rounds, has brought this meeting to pass:—I had the <hi rend="italic">first Resolution</hi> sent to me on Saturday with a request that I would move it, to which (after reading it) I consented: and because I did so last evening I am made one of this Deputation.—</p>
         <p>That is just the plain state of the case. What <hi rend="italic">I</hi> said, I suppose you will see in the “Times”—to which I must refer you. I think (notwithstanding the weather) it was the <hi rend="italic">largest</hi> Pub. meeting I have ever seen in Napier.—as a small (though not erroneous) test of real public feeling, I may mention, that (<hi rend="italic">after ⅔rds. or more of the people had left</hi>) it occurred to the getters-up of the meeting to call for a 1/- or 6d. collection to defray expenses:—₤2.14.0 (the amount required) was gathered in no time, and monies afterwards tendered were refused and returned as not required. Indeed, I saw more than one working man tender a half Crown—there was quite a rush to subscribe &amp; no shirking; just so it was to sign their names to a pledge to stand together to defray legal expenses (if needed).</p>
         <p>                             I am, my dear Sir</p>
         <p>                                             Yours truly     W. Colenso.</p>
