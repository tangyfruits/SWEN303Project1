         <p>2886 My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>This mg. on my way to Spit to see Capt., steamer,—going to Wairoa, I went to Land Regn. Office to see if I could hunt up anything about Sealy’s 2 Sns. (<hi rend="italic">1 &amp; 2</hi> / Wairoa),—after some search <hi rend="italic">the vol. </hi>was found &amp; I find they are Regd. in <hi rend="italic">D. Black’s </hi>own name (without ref. to Sealy or to anyone else) &amp; <hi rend="italic">no sum mentioned</hi>: I felt disappointed, &amp; I tried to see something more concerning them, but no use!—</p>
         <p>The Fee was 2/- (always now in looking at <hi rend="italic">anything </hi>Reqd. <hi rend="italic">under Ld. Transfer Act</hi>!) &amp; they wouldn’t take money—nor <hi rend="italic">common </hi>stamps—so I had to go &amp; hunt up “<hi rend="italic">Law &amp; Deeds Stamps</hi>” (a new kind of thing) but the only <hi rend="italic">legal tender </hi>there)! Returning with my red 2/- stamp, I tendered it, but no, I must gum it on to the sheet of paper, say what it was for &amp; then cancel it by writing across it, as in case of a 1d. receipt stamp! what labour &amp; waste of time!!</p>
         <p>I fancy S—y has acted cannily in the matter; but it is something to know that D.B. owns Nos. 1 &amp; 2.—</p>
         <p>Day is <hi rend="italic">very fine </hi>but the surf is very high, doubtful if we leave tonight: I am to know this evening, &amp; if we leave we do so at <hi rend="italic">2 a.m. </hi>an awkward hour.</p>
         <p>Several came to me in the street about “the <hi rend="italic">Building </hi>sites,”—I told them they were too late, the show was over!</p>
         <p>Good bye</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
