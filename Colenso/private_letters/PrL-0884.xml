         <p rend="end">Napier, New Zealand,<lb/>October 18<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, 1893.</p>
         <p>My dear Nephew &amp; Namesake</p>
         <p>A few days ago I received your kind letter of 27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. August, and was glad to find you &amp; yours were all well, and I think <hi rend="italic">doing </hi>well.—You &amp; yours seem to have a full share of work, and your sailor son, also, to be very fortunate in his particular line—may such long continue! I usually, or almost, invariably, write “<hi rend="italic">Home</hi>” by the “<hi rend="italic">Frisco</hi> Mail”—but <hi rend="italic">parcels </hi>are <hi rend="italic">not sent by her</hi>, and as I am putting up a small parcel of books for you to go by this “<hi rend="italic">Direct</hi> Mail” soon leaving us, I write to you by her. In your letter you enclose a <hi rend="italic">Circular</hi> asking for books for your “<hi rend="italic">Free Library</hi>”: is this the same as the “<hi rend="underline italic">Penzance</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> Library</hi>”? If so, then I have every year sent a volume of our “N.Z. Institute Transactions,” (cost me about 25/- each,)—but if <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi>, then I could send copies of <hi rend="italic">my Papers only </hi>contained in those volumes—in pamphlet form. In this parcel I now send you will find 2 copies of nearly every Paper, published separately (some having come down very low,) I leave it to you to distribute them. You refer to <hi rend="italic">titles</hi> of books of the “Free Library,” as having been mentioned in some of your Penz. Papers, but though I get the “Telegraph” regularly from Willie—I rarely ever look into one: I pass them on, immediately on receipt, to Mr. Knowles (Willie’s friend), &amp; here they are, now, tied up by him in bundles of 4! &amp; unopened by me: I receive also the London “Standard,” (a Daily), &amp; this is always ahead! for I cannot keep up with it; having but little time to spare for Newspapers. I note what you say about your aunt Ellen: I agree with you, as to your advice to her respecting her savings ₤200. &amp; her placing it in the P.O. sinking fund, by which she is <hi rend="italic">sure </hi>of ₤16. yrly. but is that <hi rend="italic">all </hi>she has to live on? I will endeavour to help <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> &amp; through you, but I have long been over-weighted with Latimer, &amp; Willie (Glen Trewithen.), &amp; Mrs Tucker. (Were it not for these I would keep a Buggy &amp; horse, &amp; boy to drive!) (to say nothing of the <hi rend="underline italic">many</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>calls continually being made on me <hi rend="underline italic">here</hi>:) I hope to enclose a ₤<hi rend="underline italic">5</hi>. P.O. Order for Ellen, &amp; this sum I will send <hi rend="italic">to you for her</hi> every year about Xmas. You have no need to tell her it is from<hi rend="italic"> me</hi>—either from yourself, or some “Friend”; and if you think it better to let her have it in small sums at a time (say 10/- or 20/-) you can do so: <hi rend="italic">I leave that all to you</hi>. I trust the poor dear soul will not be too fond of showing-off her excentricities. Is she, apparently, stronger or in better health than Mrs. Tucker? Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> see much of Mrs. Tucker?</p>
         <p>I thank you for your kind remark <hi rend="italic">re </hi>putting my old house here into <hi rend="italic">better </hi>condition were you near me. We, too, have Painters, and I think from their work, <hi rend="italic">very good ones</hi>: but my house (or “Hermitage”—as some call it!) is but a wooden one, strongly built however, but never painted since the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>time, in 1859: I did not suppose I should live so long, and I am now quite surrounded by tall trees &amp; shrubs, which at this season are charmingly in flower &amp; leaf: an English Woodbine, has grown up in its own wild way among evergreen trees to 20 feet, or more, &amp; is now <hi rend="italic">full of bloom. </hi>And so (<hi rend="italic">similar height</hi>) Jessamines, both yellow &amp; white, and Roses, sorts; and then the foreigners!! Bamboos, &amp; other Australian &amp; Indian shrubs, &amp; the big towering Blue &amp; Red Gums, among them &amp; in the back-ground, form a delightful landscape, and my old standing Red Geranium fences 8–10 feet high, &amp; very close, &amp; always in flower, so that I am well screened &amp; sheltered, and (as I tell the folks inland) “I live in the <hi rend="italic">Bush</hi>”—that is, in <hi rend="italic">our </hi>language, “in the <hi rend="italic">forests</hi>”—of course I tell them so by way of taunt or banter, for though they live in the woods (or in what <hi rend="italic">was </hi>wood!) they are always chopping-down &amp; destroying their trees &amp; shrubs, so that, in nearly every one of their homesteads, there is a <hi rend="italic">want </hi>of trees &amp; shrubs, and an ugly barrenness instead!—or <hi rend="underline italic">worse</hi>, standing <hi rend="italic">black </hi>burnt trunks, &amp; prostrate logs!—</p>
         <p>I fear I may tire you with my long “yarn” about <hi rend="italic">trees</hi>—but I love them, &amp; to be <hi rend="italic">alone </hi>among them yet not <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>—<hi rend="underline italic">never</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> alone</hi>, for <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> &amp; Nature is <hi rend="italic">there</hi> &amp; every where.</p>
         <p>I am keeping very well—at times, now &amp; then, a bit of Influenza <hi rend="italic">remains </hi>(from 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. relapse!) and curiously enough confined to soles and toes! and, also, at times, Rheumatism: but I am wonderfully better than I was <hi rend="italic">last year</hi>, (that was a sad time of weakness in legs, so that I had every Sunday to be taken to &amp; from the Church at Woodville, in a ’bus! at both Mg. &amp; Evg. Service.) <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, at present, and for a month past, I have been taking full Services every Sunday at St. Augustine’s, about ⅓rd. mile distant—I <hi rend="italic">feel </hi>the walk back &amp; <hi rend="italic">the climbing this steep hill, by a zig-zag rough track, at night</hi>: but in the Ch. I can manage pretty well, although there is<hi rend="italic"> much</hi> of<hi rend="italic"> standing </hi>in<hi rend="italic"> our</hi> Services. The new Minister for Augustine’s will be here in November: and our Bishop is going to<hi rend="italic"> resign</hi>! at which I am very sorry. Your long winter will have begun before this reaches you. I hope it may prove to be a fair one—not too rough. And now my dear Nephew, with much love to you &amp; yours, &amp; to the family there with you generally. Believe me to be</p>
         <p>             Your affectionate Uncle</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I have long owed Rd. a letter, which I trust to pay before the New Year.</p>
