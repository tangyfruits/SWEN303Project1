         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>Feby. 24. 1876.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir George Grey,</p>
         <p>Last week I received a few copies of the enclosed letter (a kind of <hi rend="italic">résumé re </hi>Maori Lexicon) which I had written in July last for the better information of the House of Representatives &amp; the Government,—<hi rend="italic">but </hi>which has only <hi rend="italic">just been </hi>printed! and it has occurrd to me (as I have mentioned your name in it, and as you formerly took such a great interest in the Work) to send you a copy, just to call your attention to its contents. Although I fear in so doing I am intruding on your valuable time and many duties.— </p>
         <p>I do not know if you were in the House on the 19<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. October, <hi rend="italic">at the time </hi>when (after some opposition and unpleasant remarks, <hi rend="italic">vide</hi>, “Hansard,” pp. 590, 591,) ₤100. was voted for me on my giving up <hi rend="italic">all </hi>my Mss. to the Government. But, as neither my explanatory letter nor specimen pages were printed and in Members’ hands, I have demurred to assent thereto: and so I have just officially informed the Government.</p>
         <p>I believe the “Specimen pages” are not yet printed! and perhaps never will be.—</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well.           I am</p>
         <p>Dear Sir G. Grey,</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
