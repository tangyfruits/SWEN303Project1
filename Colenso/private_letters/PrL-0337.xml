         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand, Sunday<lb/>Afternoon, Feby. 4, 1877.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>My last to you was on Jany. 8, &amp; 9.—<hi rend="italic">Our </hi>Mail by S.F. not yet arrd. <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, although it got to Auckland <hi rend="italic">last Sunday</hi>! its own proper day. Unfortunately for us, the “S.Cross,” which had arrd. there from Napier only the day before, had something amiss with her boiler tubes, &amp; so the authorities sent the Napier portion by “Star of South” (just got back from Fiji), she—with <hi rend="italic">her sheep</hi>, reached Pov. Bay yesty., so I suppose we shall get our letters tomorrow; but the outgoing Eng. Mail leaves here, <hi rend="italic">overland</hi>, on Wednesday,—therefore I <hi rend="italic">don’t wait </hi>the receiving of yours.</p>
         <p>There is pretty much of news—but the great topic is <hi rend="italic">the election</hi>! for the vacant seat of Napier: nomn. day is Thursday 8, &amp; Polling Day Thursday 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. There are 5 Candidates <hi rend="italic">now</hi> in field (&amp; one <hi rend="italic">withdrawn</hi>, R. Stuart,)—Sutton, Buchanan, Rhodes, Tiffen, &amp; W.C. Any amount of letters in the papers! (none from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, nor on my behalf,) and Sutton &amp; Buchanan have been holding meetings (<hi rend="italic">each</hi>) at Hastings, Taradale, Wairoa &amp; Napier, abusing each other nicely (!). Sheehan, too, going about with B. &amp; of course, upholding him.—Sheehan is <hi rend="italic">now </hi>a voter on our <hi rend="italic">new </hi>Roll; wh. contains nearly 1200 names!!—some merely as “Ratepayers,” some as “Lodgers.” Folks say the fight is between S.B. &amp; W.C.—Tiffen (it is said) will be nowhere, &amp; J.Rh. not much better:—we shall see. I fear, through T. &amp; R. fighting it out, that B. may get in; both T. &amp; R. take votes <hi rend="italic">from me</hi>, (such as Chambers, Locke, W. Marshall, &amp; others,) but I <hi rend="italic">don’t</hi> (that I know of) take <hi rend="italic">from them</hi>. I am taking it <hi rend="italic">very easy</hi>—as an old soldier, or veteran; I only issued my Address <hi rend="italic">3 times</hi>, &amp; I ask no one for a vote. Not a few, however, have let me know they will vote for me.—</p>
         <p>We have had some Weddings!—the Editor “Herald” W.W.C. to Miss Julia Begg (4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. daur. of S.B.)—Manoy to a Miss Moss (Jewess) of Wgn.,—and Renouf to a Jersey woman (relative of J. le Quesne’s) named Le Moyman; &amp; Thompson (the old baldheaded schoolmaster, now Campbell’s asst.) &amp; a Scandinavian girl!! </p>
         <p>The Town Swamp Roads are advanced to Monroe St., <hi rend="italic">in </hi>Cl. Sq., &amp; have <hi rend="italic">made the turn</hi> towards Cape Kidnapper. Weather of late has been <hi rend="italic">dry </hi>&amp; hot (w. <hi rend="italic">winds</hi>), &amp; <hi rend="italic">today</hi> it looks as if a Black N. Easter was brewing. I have had some nice Peaches of late in my garden—would I could give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> some.</p>
         <p>Methodist (Wesleyan) anniversary just over (2 months <hi rend="italic">before</hi> its time!!—some folks say, owing to J.Rh. &amp; coming election he being Chn.—<hi rend="italic">of course</hi>:) <hi rend="italic">only </hi>Mr Irvine was there as a Speaker—nearly <hi rend="italic">all </hi>singing by “Amateurs of Napier.”</p>
         <p>A Row is brewing—or <hi rend="italic">begun</hi>! between W. Marshall &amp; S. Williams, (or, I fear, <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the Wms. clan) see the Papers I send: I am sorry for it,—and for W.M.—it will be the old story of the Earthen Jar &amp; the Brazen one!</p>
         <p>F. Sutton <hi rend="italic">lost </hi>his case—<hi rend="italic">against</hi> Whitmore, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>return for Clive; &amp; H.R.R. gained his against Sydney Johnston, (but merely through a slight irregularity on part of Drower the Returning Officer) &amp; now H.R.R. and Sy.J. are out again for another election fight!</p>
         <p>Mr Ormond has just <hi rend="italic">cleared out</hi>, with family, &amp; dear old Mrs Thompson!—gone to Wgn. to reside. Watt &amp; Farmer have just <hi rend="italic">really settled </hi>w. the natives—paying them <hi rend="italic">nearly </hi>₤20,000! Sheehan &amp; <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the natives owners assenting. Hiraka (Arihi’s husband) is just dead:—more work, I suppose, for the Lawyers! J.N.Wilson is back—at last!—came overland from Wellington; he is <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> well,—stouter (in face) than he was: he shook hands w. me the day he arrived,—but, since then hands in pockets, &amp; gruff as before!— “Whats bred in the bone &amp;c.”—Wood, Shoemaker, of Kaikoura, is dead; &amp; a poor old woman, named McMahon, was killed by the train near the Governt. Cottages. Grubb is well, but very busy. Dr. Gibbes’ house is advancing, &amp; promises well; it should be, for Dentist Wilson’s is very pretentious, &amp; must cost a good round sum. Mr Sidey is very well. So P.D. &amp; his family. And your old friend Cotterill; and Fannin.———</p>
         <p>I have not yet been to Wairoa—­­I purpose going thither this month,—but I go nowhere until the election is over, lest the Croakers say, I went electioneering. A letter came to me for you, postmkd. Wairoa,—I took it to Grubb (seeing it was in an envelope w. Red Seal Royal Arms—who sd. “It was a demand for Rates, as there were many in the Mail;” so I opened it, &amp; it is so. I shall enclose <hi rend="italic">part</hi> in one of the papers.—the demand is on “₤4.0.0 rateable value of 5 ac. &amp; 2 Tn. Sns. Clyde,”—which, of course, I shall pay.—</p>
         <p>Ellison &amp; Son have run <hi rend="italic">our </hi>rates <hi rend="italic">up</hi> nicely! I suspected they would do so. My house (formerly ₤90.) is now ₤150. <hi rend="italic">same </hi>as McLean’s &amp; Ferard’s—while Irvine’s &amp; grounds only ₤100. &amp; Dr. H’s. &amp; 7 acres, only ₤105. Then the paddocks are greatly increased,—ex. Hague’s (formerly ₤60.) now ₤100.—Couray, Hague’s successor, has told me he must give it up. I shall <hi rend="italic">appeal </hi>in the House, but, I fear, with but poor chances of getting relieved!</p>
         <p>I have at last (after long deliberation) written Offy. to Edn. Board, wh. meets <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>, resigning my office of Inspr. <hi rend="italic">unless I am better paid</hi>,—for I still do <hi rend="italic">as much </hi>clerical work as ever (70 letters in Jany—besides <hi rend="italic">heaps</hi> of other work—Returns for Genl. Govt.—purchasing &amp; packing Books, Maps, Black Boards, Slates, &amp;c, &amp;c.,—all the schools, &amp; Teachers’ accounts, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.)—for F. is only Secy. to <hi rend="italic">the Board</hi>!—I don’t greatly care which way they may decide: <hi rend="italic">we shall see</hi>.</p>
         <p>Sladen’s 7 yrs. mortgage is up in March (how time flies!)—I have written to remind: he replies he is “<hi rend="italic">not </hi>prepared”; how will it end? Mackay (Tamumu) has done <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> yet! his affairs are shaky, he has put <hi rend="italic">his Debtors </hi>into Cornford’s hands, who <hi rend="italic">may</hi> extricate him.—</p>
         <p>I have made a curious arrangement w. G. Stewart, Porangahau,—you know he borrd. money (₤300) from Kinross,—well, time (3 yrs.) is up, &amp; K. wished it closed. For the 72 acres I had leased to him he pays ₤20. pr. ann. w. a purg. cl., <hi rend="italic">at end</hi>, for ₤230. that land is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> worth ₤10. an acre! &amp; I have lent G.S. ₤200. on my own land! raising the pg. clause to ₤430., &amp; he paying ₤40. per ann. henceforth.—He is getting on well—<hi rend="italic">slowly &amp; surely</hi>.</p>
         <p>Lyndon &amp; others tell me that money is rather <hi rend="italic">scarce</hi> (so Banner &amp; Co. <hi rend="italic">this day</hi>, 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.)—properties <hi rend="italic">don’t </hi>sell—many are in the market,—&amp; money is sought after. Robjohns has built a House on no.334 (next to Brewery) &amp; Dr. H. is going to fence his paddock, posts so on the ground:—he keeps 3 traps now, &amp; is always driving about.</p>
         <p>A house (for a Watchmakers Shop) has been put up in Emerson St. <hi rend="italic">next </hi>Sn. this way to that I sold to Mrs Tuke. Tuke (the goose!) has put up a high iron fence (like Tiffen’s) in front of his house (Thomas’ old one) &amp; door of <hi rend="italic">same</hi>! so that it looks like a prison—or Asylum! I only saw it yesterday.</p>
         <p>Wm. Thomas’ son, George, who was in the Customs,—and who has been doing the Gentleman (or better,—being more truthful,—the <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> life) for 2 years, &amp; who is now at Fiji—writes to his father, that they will get <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that prosperity there! I have seen the letters; it seems strange, of course, the old man, wife, &amp; son-in-law “Alf. Price <hi rend="underline italic">Esquire</hi>”, are <hi rend="italic">in excelsis</hi>. Charley, too, the other brother, has another boy born—and “there never were such infants”!! (as the grandmother says, who has sweet photos. of them all.—</p>
         <p rend="end">Feby. 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.— </p>
         <p>I now proceed to close:—I found, in twon today, &amp; at P.O., that <hi rend="italic">another </hi>Bag of Papers &amp;c (Mail) had turned up—&amp; among them, two more from you, one (I fancy) the big <hi rend="italic">Report</hi>,—with ⅔rds. or more of the address and wrapper gone—but, “enso, Esq Nap.” remaining, &amp; in your own well-known hand-writing, which both Grubb &amp; I could swear to.!!</p>
         <p>Yesterday (5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.) the Educn. Board sat, &amp; I find (from a <hi rend="italic">priv.</hi> memo. from F—n,) that the Board will <hi rend="italic">not </hi>increase my pay:—but they will agree to only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> inspection in the year, &amp; to lessen my clerical work, by their Secy. doing the Correspondence—or ⅓rd. of it.—</p>
         <p>In this I am, as it were, <hi rend="italic">checkmated</hi>: I am in a fix, &amp; I cannot <hi rend="italic">see</hi> my way—until <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the election.—</p>
         <p>More anon.—</p>
         <p>I send you an Illustrd. Paper, which (the old magpie, at least,) will remind you, &amp; your sons, of the Antipodes!</p>
         <p>There is great excitement over this election! Buchanan or Sutton <hi rend="italic">may </hi>get in; owing to Rhodes &amp; Tiffen, <hi rend="italic">each</hi> having next to no chance, standing out, if R. or T. were to retire, then the one remg. would stand a good chance. I shall be “in my lot”: and I don’t think <hi rend="italic">lowest</hi> in the poll. If I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> swallow the “Good Templar” (creed, or bait,) I could make <hi rend="italic">sure</hi>: (it has been <hi rend="italic">offered</hi>;)—but I dare not do that.—</p>
         <p>Weber wanted me to believe today, that Ellison is so <hi rend="underline italic">very</hi> careful &amp; conscientious that he <hi rend="italic">must </hi>be <hi rend="italic">right</hi>—in the matter of <hi rend="italic">rating</hi>: I asked W., If my house &amp; its 4 acres, could be <hi rend="italic">rightly</hi> valued, as being of the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> value as McLeans with its 5 ac. &amp; its good road to the door?—</p>
         <p>Sutton came in then (in Cl. Chr., &amp; Harbour Bd. day), &amp; our talk ended. Vautier told me, they were determined to see Tennyson St. S. <hi rend="italic">cleared out</hi>: it is full of privies, fowls-houses &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
         <p>So now, good bye: &amp; with kindest best ever flowing feelings of attachment &amp; regard, Believe me</p>
         <p>     Yours ever &amp; always</p>
         <p>             Wm. Colenso.</p>
