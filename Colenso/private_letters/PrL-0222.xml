         <p rend="end">Napier Augt. 30/67</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your two notes of the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. and the 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. arrived together—or within 1 hour of each other! The 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. came over-land at a slow rate, &amp; was also detained, with Coast Mail, a week, owing to flood in Waipawa river.</p>
         <p>I can now merely reply in a hurried way having much to answer, &amp;c, by this outgoing Mail.</p>
         <p>First, then,—<hi rend="italic">I am glad </hi>you thought of putting my name down towards the cabinet for Hooker: I leave to your discretion as to sum £1., £2., or £3.3.0 (as you say you have 30 or 40 subsrs.)—and <hi rend="italic">let me know when you next write </hi>how much I owe you, and I will send the amount.</p>
         <p>Many thanks for the 20 addl. Copies of essay: I think you said, you were about to distribute some Copies, I should like to send one to Travers, to Mantell, to the Governor, &amp; to one or two others (&amp; to Mr Ackland)—but I hesitate doing so as I think you would have sent them a copy ea.—am I right?</p>
         <p>When you have done with Owen’s work on the <hi rend="italic">Moa</hi>, I will thank you to return it—<hi rend="italic">no hurry</hi>, but I have been asked to give a lecture of some kind or other—and I may go in for this—or it may form a <hi rend="italic">dish</hi> among others.</p>
         <p>Thanks for the seeds of Tussae grass—which I shall distribute by pinches to a few careful individuals here. I am sorry you gave Rolleston the trouble of hunting for what could not be found in his precincts—of course the <hi rend="italic">fault is mine</hi>. Now, then, I too must hunt—I have, of &amp; on, done so: it is a most mysterious disappearance—but I must find it, if above ground &amp; here.—</p>
         <p>Domett’s note Cong. Library &amp;c.—being nothing in favour (for which, through not hearing, I was partly prepared,) of course I don’t visit Wellington just now. Is the Library open during the recess?</p>
         <p>The good P. Master General has stopped my priv. of franking, &amp;c,—which the Governor granted me last year (before Mr Hall came into office)—I knew nothing of it till last week!—I am writing to Mr Richmond about it.—</p>
         <p>I fully intended to write to Hooker by this Mail but cannot. It is plaguy our having so little mail Commn. w. Wellington.</p>
         <p>When you have spare time (if you ever have any) let me have a line.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Could you send (by Ormond) any scraps of the common <hi rend="italic">matrices </hi>of gold, or of the <hi rend="italic">N.Z.</hi> overlying or underlying Rocks of same.    W.C.</p>
         <p>Would you kindly ask Mantell to secure &amp; send me copies of all <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> Maori petitions?</p>
