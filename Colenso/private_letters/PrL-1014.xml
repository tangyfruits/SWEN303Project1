         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>October 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1897.</p>
         <p>My dear Nephew William</p>
         <p>My last letter to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> was on the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> August: since then yours to me of 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. August is to hand, and I thank you for it. I wrote to Rd. by last months mail, and I think I sent <hi rend="italic">you</hi> some papers by it. I was much pleased to know of your son’s promotion, &amp; heartily wish him success and all good wishes in his profession: keep me informed from time to time of his getting on. Your <hi rend="italic">kind invitation</hi> to your new home in Chapel Street I thank you for, I smile at your not very apt comparison between this <hi rend="italic">old </hi>man nearing 90, &amp; your <hi rend="italic">young </hi>visitor from Melbourne! and what is <hi rend="italic">still </hi>worse is the fact of my being such a dreadful <hi rend="italic">bad sailor</hi>, never recovering from sea-sickness throughout the voyage: have been warned by medical men, fellow passengers, that I ought not to go to sea at all, as I do so at risk of life: indeed I never knew of anyone like me in this respect.—I am obliged to you for your information about Dr. Helm: as you truly remark, such information should have been given to me <hi rend="italic">before</hi>—when I asked for it. As a matter of course, I could not for a moment conceive of a Dr. at poor little Marazion being considered equal to those at Penzance: besides, I had, years ago, formed a <hi rend="italic">very poor </hi>opinion of that Dr. Helm, from having seen frequently notices of him in Penz. papers, opposing &amp; bickering in the Marketjew Town Board (or whatever the meeting was) of which he was a member: moreover his <hi rend="italic">silly</hi> questions to W., poor fellow, (as reported at the time to me by S.)—and his <hi rend="italic">worse </hi>remark— “that it was unusual to happen at such an <hi rend="italic">advanced</hi> age though more common at <hi rend="italic">younger</hi>”!! How this has been laughed at by Medical men here! I, too, knowing a <hi rend="italic">good deal </hi>of Med. Practice and of diseases, having had <hi rend="italic">much </hi>to do in that way: before I quit this <hi rend="italic">unpleasant </hi>subject, I will again say—it would have been better for W. “<hi rend="underline italic">If he had never known Dr. Helm</hi>”: I say no more: do not bring it up again.</p>
         <p>I have <hi rend="italic">not </hi>had my letter from Secy. Museum (as you, in part, suppose) about the slab of “Greenstone”, and had made up my mind (seeing he, or they, know not its value) to offer them 10 guineas for it, &amp; pay all expenses to have it returned to me; but recently I have received a letter from Mr Enys, President of P.A. &amp; N.H. Society, in which he—(in a <hi rend="italic">friendly way </hi>as I knew him here in N.Z.)—writes respecting the slab—of its being a great acquisition―of its value, &amp;c.―&amp; how pleased he was to see it, &amp; to read my paper respecting it: Mr Enys being also a Member of our N.Z. Institute. In replying to his kind letter I have plainly told him (as above) that I was about to make that offer through you as I (or we) had been badly treated. If I send a Moss, or a Fern, or a shell, or even a copy of a paper, to <hi rend="italic">any </hi>Society at Home―Brit. Museum, Royal, or Linnean Society, I get a handsome letter of thanks, not merely from a Secy., but voted &amp; recorded at their Meeting: but <hi rend="italic">this </hi>treatment (<hi rend="italic">as I take it</hi>) is <hi rend="italic">not new to me, nor </hi>the first <hi rend="italic">from </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">this Penz. Society</hi>; hence, too, it was, that I ceased writing any more papers for them, seeing their old maids &amp; <hi rend="italic">young</hi> parsonettes carried things their own way. I could say pretty much on this head―but I refrain: folks that were <hi rend="italic">not </hi>of Penzance, nor even <hi rend="italic">Cornish</hi>! had too much to say, in former years, in the said N.H. Society: and now it is dwindled down to the having picnic jaunts―visiting old churches, &amp;c, &amp; listening to a lot of <hi rend="italic">half spurious </hi>ecclesiastical talk―from young High Ch. (Half-Romish) Curates, &amp;c, &amp;c, and so congratulate each other and think highly of themselves! But enough of that.――</p>
         <p>I am keeping pretty (or very) well in general health―a <hi rend="italic">wonder to many</hi>! The worst is, my <hi rend="italic">want of walking power</hi>, from that dreadful nervous shock: I walk well enough <hi rend="italic">in</hi>doors, and outside on the level paths in front of my house for a short time―¼ hour or 20 minutes, and I do think I am gradually gaining strength in my legs: there is <hi rend="italic">no pain</hi>, only weakness―want of commanding, or muscular, power in walking―causing me to totter, without great care, and so I keep at home, &amp; don’t go into the town.―I don’t care for society, nor too many visitors, better <hi rend="italic">without</hi> them, not having any time to waste, &amp; plenty to do, every day―<hi rend="italic">lots</hi> of letters to write, &amp;c, &amp;c. I go to bed about XI, or XI.30 (my <hi rend="italic">favourite hour</hi>), rise at VII, breakfast VII.30,―appetite good: sleep pretty well, but <hi rend="italic">of late </hi>too much troubled with ugly-awful dreams. I have much, my dear nephew, to be thankful for―have some (a few) kind &amp; real friends, &amp; my full share of enemies―for whom I care not a rap. <hi rend="underline italic">My trust is in </hi>
            <hi rend="underline smallcaps italic">God</hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">―</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">whose servant I am</hi>. And I seek to have this clearer and clearer every day: Goodbye, Kind regards and love to your good wife―your family, dear Mother and yourself, I am your affect. Uncle.</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>My right hand and arm are <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> what they once were.</p>
         <p>Finally closed 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Weather fine &amp; I pretty well.</p>
      </body>
