         <p>The Hon. The Colonial Secretary<lb/>Auckland.</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>I have the honor to inform you, that, as early as possible after my return hither from Wellington (on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ulto.), I lost no time in preparing to remove my Goods and Furniture from Waitangi, and in meeting there the two Arbitrators appointed 1by the Government and myself—Messrs. Chambers and ASlexander.—They, having first chosen D. Gollan, Esq. J.P., as Umpire between them should they disagree, proceeded to inspect and to consider what sum ought to be awarded to me as Compensation on surrendering the Premises. From them I received their Award in writing, a Copy of which I enclose.<note xml:id="ftn2-63" place="foot" n="63"> Chambers and Alexander valued the improvements on the land at ₤350.</note>—</p>
         <p>As I wish, Sir, to be as brief as possible on this (to me) unpleasant subject, I will merely add, that I have already removed six cart-loads of Goods, Furniture, or Books, Agricultural Implements, Timber, &amp;c.—and intend removing the whole of the remainder (about 3 loads more, all which is packed and ready) tomorrow;—when I shall visit the place for the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time.—</p>
         <p>                     Awaiting your Commands,<lb/>                            I have the honor to be,         Sir,<lb/>                       Your mo. ob. servt.<lb/>                                Wm. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
