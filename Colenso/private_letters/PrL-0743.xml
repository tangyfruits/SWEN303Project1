         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">I </hi>cannot express to you in a few words how much I was pleased this day on receipt of yr. <hi rend="italic">welcome </hi>letter of 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—it was a great deal more than I had ventured to expect, knowing how you must have been engaged and the weather (there as here!) so much against you: believe me, when I say,—I <hi rend="italic">do thank </hi>you for it.—–</p>
         <p>The main items of interest to me were <hi rend="italic">your own welfare, </hi>including of course, your wife &amp; family. I (or, rather, <hi rend="italic">we</hi>) did think of you on that awful Sunday mg.!—a day to be remembered <hi rend="italic">here </hi>of severe &amp; lasting fog &amp; heavy rain! and, on the My. mg., <hi rend="italic">not seeing </hi>your name in list of passgrs., in papers, the conclusion was—you did not embark, &amp; Craig could <hi rend="italic">not </hi>inform me. I, on that Sy. Evg., had to go in vain &amp;c. to St. Augustine’s to hold service,—I assure you, it was a job to get up &amp; down this hill, burdened w. my thick dripping cloak, &amp;c.—and so,again, last Sy. night, I had to take S. at St. Andrew’s, but Montgy. drove me thither &amp; back in the rain, &amp;c. Our weather has been mostly wet, hail at times, cold, &amp;c.—The Ruahine last week looked <hi rend="italic">grand</hi>—through a break in the clouds &amp; the sun shining. I am keeping tolerably well—rather <hi rend="italic">too much</hi> of pain through Rheumatism which of late has been pretty constant. The Minister expected (by Bp.) from Auckland for Woodville has not yet put in an appearance, so the Bp. went there on Sunday (i.e. flitting day!) and the Dean last Sunday—it is quite likely I may have to go thither again early in August: &amp; <hi rend="italic">I am quite willing to go.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Our Sy. meeting, on My. 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. was well attended—a paper by Dr. Moore on “Halo” &amp;c—and 1 by Mr Lamb on “Health”,—followed by a show of a few plants by me. It was a painful time (to me—at least) to hear MacD. read the minutes of your &amp; H’s. <hi rend="italic">last </hi>meeting. Several new members were then elected, &amp; I believe a <hi rend="italic">lot </hi>more since (nearly 20 in all)—McD. is very active &amp; seemingly “<hi rend="italic">at home</hi>” in his new work! Large, too, <hi rend="italic">as Treasr. </hi>is <hi rend="italic">all there.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>After long discussion, ₤150 is to be borrd. from Bk. for 12 mths. on guarantee of 9 or 10 members—that sum, with the receipts from members, it is said, will pay off present debt; I have <hi rend="italic">not </hi>fallen-in with it.</p>
         <p>Several deaths: Willis, at Spit: old Mrs Northe; Cullen this day: 2 tg. men named Gillies, &amp; Hawkins both of Hastings St.,—I. Power (P. Dolbel’s shepherd at Petane) drowned at the Port: Miss Ferguson married to some young man of Maraekakaho: Willie youngest son (22) of my old friend John Mackenzie of Tamumu, buried this day:—</p>
         <p>I am now off (unwillingly) to Athenæum—annual meeting so please excuse: kind regards,</p>
         <p>                             Yours truly, W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. You did not say how your little child is.—Did you receive a note I sent to you on the Saty. mg.</p>
