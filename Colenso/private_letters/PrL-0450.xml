         <p rend="end">April 1881</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour </p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>My man has just come up from town, and has brought me your note of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,which I was glad to see, for I had been fearing I should not hear from you, before I left for inland. And I should have gone off this morning—had there not been some delay on part of the Lawyers in town in preparing Deeds I have to sign before I go.</p>
         <p>Yesterday Mr P. Dolbel called, who I was glad to see, not having seen him for some time. I enquired of him concerning you—but he could not tell me much. And now, though time is very precious to me just now (for I am writing to England to leave behind to go by next mail, &amp; also putting up a few things to please my good Scotch friends down at Dunedin for their Industrial Exhibi­tion, coming off next month,) I must write <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a line, as it will be of inter­est to you.</p>
         <p>On 30 March I received a thumping big packet from Dr Hector, containing prin­ted sheets of all my papers (omitting the Zoological one, which was received by him too late,) which have been printed for the new Vol., and <hi rend="italic">commencing</hi> the book with them; I was, as you may well suppose, both surprised &amp; pleased. Those sheets were sent to me to look over <hi rend="italic">quickly</hi>, and to mark down any errors for the “Errata” page of the Vol. The Dr saying he hoped I would find <hi rend="italic">none</hi>; Un­fortunately I found nearly 50; and that too, in only one reading, so I was obliged to send it off to him at once.</p>
         <p>On the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> inst. we held a Council meeting; I had duly summoned all by letter but it was only after waiting, &amp; my running about the town from house to house that we got a quorum (4) together; the Bishop, Sturm, &amp; myself, were the only 3 who came in time. Well, we have to go to work again in May, and I have, I fear, to <hi rend="italic">provide</hi> the supper.</p>
         <p>I was very sorry yesterday to see poor old Sturm gazetted as a Bankrupt; I feel for him.</p>
         <p>Take care of your fragment of bone: you may yet find more.</p>
         <p>Last week I received a copy of the Report of the Auckland Society, and as we were writing about Museums—I just copy a bit;­—</p>
