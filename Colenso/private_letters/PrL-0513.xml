         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour </p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your kind note dated 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> came to hand last night together with the little box,—as it was late when my man returned from town I did not open your box until this morning. I found the curious little larva all right, &amp; I mean to look after it, to see what it may turn out,—when I will report.</p>
         <p>It is not however on account of the larva I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> write (immediately &amp; in haste) but on account of a pretty little <hi rend="italic">Hepatica</hi> you enclosed with it, which I find is just coming into full fruit, and is, therefore, in a state desirable for examination. I enclose a bit (one whole plant) that you may know it, &amp; please send me a lot (as I suppose they are pretty common in your shady bowers) &amp; that without breaking them up but as little as possible. Put them in plenty of Moss, which I see is also flowering or fruiting!. When I get from you some fresh specimens, I will also report on them.</p>
         <p>The little plant is common enough, but it is not so easy to get <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> specimens, for being delicate, they soon wither.</p>
         <p>I hope you are all well. I am tolerably so. I am thinking of spending a day at Springfield next week.</p>
         <p>With kind regards</p>
         <p>                             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
