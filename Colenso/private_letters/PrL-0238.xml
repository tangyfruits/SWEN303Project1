         <p>Hon. D. McLean</p>
         <p>     &amp;c  &amp;c  &amp;c</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I just write you a message sent to me from Porokoro and the M. Chiefs—assembled at Pakowhai.—(After lamenting your absence &amp; Mr Cooper’s and saying they had only 2 men left whom they could trust,!! Mr Locke &amp; myself—they say)—brought by Te Awapuni,</p>
         <p>“Haere, mea utu ki a Neho, kia puta te kupu ki nga pakeha,—e, <hi rend="italic">kaua e hikaka, kia tangata-maatuatia te Whakaaro.</hi>”—They have fetched Porokoro from his place and will keep him at Pakowhai, as <hi rend="italic">they don’t like the aspect of things</hi>; they fear any incursion from inland, now that the returned natives are made desperate. They also wish their own people back from Poverty—<hi rend="italic">do not like those Europeans </hi>in command, &amp;c &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>I have thought it to be my duty to write you these few words. I would you were here; perhaps had you been here things might have been managed better at Poverty. <hi rend="italic">I regret exceedingly </hi>that the returned natives have been hunted. I think they might have been quietly managed.—But I fear it is too late now. Without very great care I foresee serious times—more for outlying settlers.</p>
         <p>Volunteers—<hi rend="italic">such as one would wish</hi>—are not to be had in sight of Auckld. gold diggings:—and unless the <hi rend="italic">Natives </hi>have <hi rend="italic">full confidence in their leaders, they have no heart.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">There is </hi>much <hi rend="italic">dissatisfaction among them I know</hi>,—the Europeans getting their land bit by bit for grog, &amp;c. &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> upon them—<hi rend="italic">their seeking </hi>to reduce the rents as agreed on by Lease—their mortgages—Bills of Sale, &amp;c. &amp;c., (as Hapuku’s and others)—Bp. Wms. building here &amp; <hi rend="italic">leaving </hi>his flock—the article which appeared in “Waka Maori” about lowering their rents——every thing tends to make them gloomy &amp; sour. &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>Could <hi rend="italic">you</hi> run up by Str. to P. Bay? <hi rend="italic">You </hi>might do good<hi rend="italic">.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I have <hi rend="italic">hazarded </hi>all I have scribbled—but I have done so, as if I were confidentially talking with you.—</p>
         <p>Excuse the scrawl—done here (with people going in &amp; out) to catch the mail.—</p>
         <p>If I can be of any service you may depend upon me, although I fear that time is past.</p>
         <p>I hear there is <hi rend="italic">news</hi>, by steamer just in from Poverty—but I don’t know it yet.</p>
         <p>     Believe me</p>
         <p>             My dear Sir</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                             Wm Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. You are at liberty to tell <hi rend="italic">Mr. Stafford</hi> any portion of this. W.C.</p>
