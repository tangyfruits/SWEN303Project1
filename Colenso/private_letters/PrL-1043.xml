            </hi>April 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> 1898</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>Although I wrote to you so recently (on Easter Day, 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.,) I feel inclined to write you a few lines more tonight, to go with the “Library Year Book” tomorrow. I thank you for it—for your <hi rend="italic">double </hi>kindness I may truly say, in borrowing it for me. It has given me a world of work!—though of great service—just because it was almost <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to <hi rend="italic">choose</hi> a <hi rend="doubleunderline underline italic">few</hi> Libraries from the 1000d’s. mentioned therein. Before it came to hand, on Monday, I had gone through the lot the <hi rend="underline italic">big</hi> lot! of names &amp; Libraries in pp.652–656, vol. XXIX, “Trans. N.Z.I.” (as perhaps I mentioned in my last) &amp; felt dismayed—½ upset; and now this newly arrived vol. added to my troubles—for were I to give <hi rend="italic">the whole impression </hi>(500 copies) such would be of small service, &amp; not easily shared out among them. However I have done my best—what I could, under existing circumstances. Have this day made out my List, &amp; sent it to Seddon—50, from names in XXIX (beg. at p.65<hi rend="underline italic">3</hi>) (omitting those on 652,—leaving them <hi rend="italic">for Seddon</hi>) taken from <hi rend="italic">your vols</hi>, “<hi rend="italic">Free pub. </hi>Libraries under Rating Act.”,—besides those, I have to send copies to <hi rend="italic">all our </hi>auxiliary branches, and to societies of whom I am a Member, and to a large no. of friends.</p>
         <p>Last nt. I recd. a kind note from Mackay, <hi rend="italic">returning</hi>, also, the <hi rend="underline italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="sup underline italic">nd</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> copy</hi> I had sent <hi rend="italic">him</hi> of “Certain Errors”:—I had partly supposed <hi rend="italic">I had sent him one </hi>at <hi rend="italic">same time</hi> with yours—but <hi rend="italic">the thing</hi> I wished to know, M. has <hi rend="italic">not </hi>touched on, viz. whether any copies has been struck off for Govt.? I did not pointedly ask him. He will get me <hi rend="italic">200</hi> bound in cloth. But I suppose I shall soon hear from S., <hi rend="italic">If he wants any</hi>! I am glad this phase of the job is over.—–</p>
         <p>While looking into XXIX—I noticed some of Kirk’s papers (I had not seen before), &amp; was struck with their want of – – –, well, <hi rend="italic">Fair play</hi>: N.B. p.510, 5 l. from bottom—<hi rend="italic">re </hi>“<hi rend="italic">C. juncea</hi>, &amp; Dr.S.”—&amp; stating it was discovd. in ’49 or ’50, by <hi rend="italic">him</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">described </hi>by Hooker: in the <hi rend="italic">HandBk </hi>it is stated by <hi rend="italic">H.</hi> as being discd. by <hi rend="underline italic">me</hi> who first found it <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in ’45, or so:—and <hi rend="italic">so, again</hi>, with another, <hi rend="italic">C. nana</hi>, p.506 also discovd. &amp; descd. by <hi rend="underline italic">me</hi>—&amp; <hi rend="italic">given by </hi>H. as mine, at p.49, Hd.Bk. At p.510, Kirk says, he <hi rend="italic">has </hi>my pubd. account of an early jy., East Cape &amp; Interior, &amp; he <hi rend="italic">quotes from it</hi>—<hi rend="underline italic">a little</hi>: but in his paper on <hi rend="italic">Epicarpurus</hi>, p.498—he omits altogether <hi rend="italic">my first finding it </hi>&amp; my remark— “at Te Wairere: here on the brink of a stream, I discovered a small tree of a genus unknown to me (unless it should prove to belong to the genus <hi rend="italic">Trophis</hi>); I only obsd. 1 plant, which was about 15 feet high, with smooth cineraceous bark, solitary crimson fruit, and small serrated dark green leaves. On cutting its bark a profusion of thick viscous milky juice gushed out”. (p.62.) <hi rend="italic">This </hi>was the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> mention of it in <hi rend="italic">modern </hi>times: republished by <hi rend="italic">Sir Wm.</hi> H. in “London Jl. of Botany”, &amp; also made use of by Dieffenbach in his work on N.Z. at that <hi rend="italic">early</hi> day <hi rend="underline italic">w. me</hi>; I thought I was extremely fortunate to <hi rend="italic">hit on </hi>its genus (<hi rend="italic">Trophis</hi>), &amp; so <hi rend="italic">Hooker</hi>: I had sent him specimens. <hi rend="italic">Sir J.H. </hi>pubd. it as a <hi rend="italic">T.</hi> in his <hi rend="underline italic">4to. work</hi>—<hi rend="italic">altd. aftds. </hi>to Raoul’s. Having noticed this, today, I give it to you: have no doubt there is plenty more: “as sample so sack”.</p>
         <p>Nothing hindering, I hope to go inland next wk., &amp; if I do so, &amp; stay away over a fortnight, will write to you: but I do not expect to be long absent—<hi rend="italic">not having any work to do</hi>. The Dean is up, &amp; out, &amp; married R. Holt yesterday to Miss Bishop. Weather still dry &amp; I am much as usual: always yours</p>

            <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">Why</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>such a rush for new stamps</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">No. 3. </hi>!!                                                                    Friday, 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—–</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>I had finished my letter to you last night when Anderson returned from P.O. bringing a lot! (Eng. Mail, S.F.) &amp; among the letters <hi rend="italic">one from you</hi>, which I thank you for, and one from <hi rend="italic">Gore</hi>, containing those pps. names (though <hi rend="italic">not </hi>from <hi rend="italic">last</hi> vol.) I thank you <hi rend="italic">both </hi>for this very kind &amp; thoughtful action. Of course my L. to Seddon was <hi rend="italic">posted</hi>. Your information—<hi rend="italic">re</hi> no. ptd.—cuts both ways, and I venture to doubt it being <hi rend="italic">wholly </hi>correct, because my letter to Costall (on first ½ sheet being ready for wkg. in reply to his) was plain, “<hi rend="italic">500</hi> copies,” however we shall soon <hi rend="italic">know.</hi> I had also recd. a note from <hi rend="italic">that</hi> Mr. Johnson (Reader) <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the work,—never supposing he was kin to “<hi rend="italic">own correspdt.</hi>” This <hi rend="italic">latter </hi>has been trying (through his Waipawa friends &amp; Sch. Comee. there) to get into Ed. Bd. in Carlile’s place, &amp; W. Comee. wrote to N. Comee. to support them: but NO—N. Comee. has elected Dr. Moore.</p>
         <p>Like a good &amp; useful Paterfamilias you have been taking your progeny to the sea-side, sandy beaches, &amp;c. Your mention of Lyall’s Bay, reminds me of my long &amp; toilsome walk there once: I had gone thro’ the dense forest (no road) to Ohariu (&amp; Ohaua)— “Ohario” to Settlers, &amp; returned by <hi rend="italic">coast</hi> round Cape Te Rawhiti to Wgn.,—That was early in the ’40’s., Hadfield then being a confirmed &amp; <hi rend="italic">weak </hi>invalid.—Your pretty little sea <hi rend="italic">Alga</hi> has also interested me, I colld. largely 50–60 yrs. ago. You will find mention of some in “Hd.Bk.” pp.679–681: also in Harvey’s “<hi rend="italic">Nereis Australis</hi>” with coloured drawings. Curiously enough! I have this work, Impl. 4to., &amp; <hi rend="italic">bound </hi>by Dinwiddie &amp; Co 12–15 yrs. ago—with <hi rend="italic">many others</hi>, &amp; the big parcel in from Bookbinder <hi rend="italic">never yet opened</hi>!—</p>
         <p>I was in town this mg., spent ½ hour w. the Dean he seems cheerful, but the fracture <hi rend="italic">may </hi>prove serious, supposed to be, in part, in joint; he has not yet been in bed! obliged to sit in easy chair at nights. I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have to remain in N. to help! Eccles will take Cathl. duty on 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Allanson at Woodville. Saw Dr. Sidey, looking very well. Once more—Good Bye</p>
         <p>         Yours ever,                             W. Colenso.</p>
