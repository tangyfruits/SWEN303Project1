      <p>To the CMS secretaries</p>
<p>Waitangi Jan. 28/51.</p>
<p>My dear Sirs</p>
<p>A vessel on her way to Wellington has just hove to off the Station, and as I know there is a ship there about to sail for England, I send this my Journal &amp; Report—to go by her, but cannot write now.</p>
			<p>(Signed) W. Colenso.</p>



<p>Mr Colenso’s Report </p>
<p>During the last six months I have been engaged as follows. Printing Office. Printing 500 copies 1½ sheet New Zealand Grammar, demy 12mo; composing Order of Confirmation 4pp., post 8vo., &amp; printing 200 copies of same; composing Order of Consecration for burial grounds 4pp., post, &amp; printing 100 copies of same; composing Prayer Book 1½ sheet, demy 12mo., &amp; printing 7000 copies of same. Binding Department. Binding 200 copies of St. Matthew’s Gospel, 200 copies of St. Mark &amp; Luke, 200 copies of John to Romans, 200 copies 1 Cor. to Philemon, 200 copies Hebrews to Revelations, &amp; 9 old Native Prayer &amp; Scriptures. On the Lord’s day I have either visited the natives in the different villages, or held service in Paihia Chapel. For near two months of the past six I was more or less unable to attend to my ordinary duties in the printing office &amp;c. through weakness arising from illness, but now through God’s mercy &amp; blessing, I feel myself once more restored to health. (Sigd.) William Colenso.
