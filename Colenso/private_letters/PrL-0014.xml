            <hi rend="italic">Memoranda of a Convn. which took place between the Revd.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> H. Williams and myself this morning—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Revd. H.W. called on me and proposed my going to Kororareka tomorrow (Sunday) to hold service, to which I assented.—Some conversation about the proceedings of the R.Catholics ensued: I gave him a paper to read, contg. an acct. of a trial, in which a R.C. priest was the plaintiff, and, as it was 9 o’clock, rose to go to the Pg. Office, requestg. him, if he was agreeable, to sit &amp; read the paper. He then sd. he wished to have some convn. abt. my lad’s taking a blanket from one of his boys the evg. before—adding “it has never been the custom so to act when a lad did amiss, but to see the Master of the lad &amp; acqt. him with the behavr. of the lad, &amp;c &amp;c,” and that I had “acted very improperly” in so acting. Here I sd. that <hi rend="italic">he </hi>had acted so many times—at which he got warm, and denied it, challengg. me to adduce an instance—I soon recollected the case of Kahukoka, &amp;c, wch I related, when he declared, ’twas not so—I reminded him that. in so doing “he charged me with a downright lie,” whc he, slapping the table with his hand, repeated it, adding ’twas impossible for him so to have acted, as ’twas contrary to his principle—whc he had followed for near 17 years, &amp;c, &amp;c. I sd. since then you thus chge me with a downright lie, our convn. had better end here, &amp;c.—For that affair took place between <hi rend="italic">us two.</hi> He asked me to give up the lad’s blanket—I refused to do so “unconditionally”—he sd. the cases were not parallel—I sd. they were—he sd. the action of my lad was a “dirty trespass.” I sd., allowg. that, I acted then as you wished me, gave an utu, &amp;c.—He sd. that no time had elapsed in that case, but in this I had gone quietly to bed, &amp;c &amp;c—I sd. that there,<hi rend="italic"> I</hi> went to him, here ’twas evidently his, or his lads, to come to me—as to time, that no time had elapsed in pt. of law—he havg. come as early as he could—I had the Natives talkg. to at the time, more than 20, they left at past 8, P. all, 2 fr. Natives (Robert &amp; John Tupe) were here <hi rend="italic">when they were leavg. </hi>these 2 infd. me that H.W. retd. late from Korora. ill, slept in boat, and that tho he had fixed that p. at Korera., he was so unwell as to go to lie down—these reasons were sufft. to keep me (had it been my place) from going to him that night. He again asked me to give up the B., I refused “unconditionally”—as I had often taken his lad’s clothes, and given them up, but now I wod. make an ex: especy. as I had often been insulted by his lads, and also, in this case, Messrs. F. &amp; B’s lads had restrained them selves from touching that wood on my speakg. to them &amp; that in this, tho I had spoken to his lads, they went and cut it up. He sd. in thus speakg. I insulted him as the Master of his lads. I sd. No; for it was the fact, &amp;c; at this he got warm, very warm &amp; sd. “You are an Insolent Man” I sd. I had never insulted him in my life, that I had always respected him. He sd. “Your lang. has been most insulting”—I sd. “I am detd. Sir, not to be irritated by anything you may say; but I pray you don’t use that language to me for ’tis more than old Adam will quietly bear, &amp;c.” “Why,” sd. Mr. W. “did you not complain if my lads had insulted you” &amp;c, I sd. that I had sevl. times, &amp; that it had not been done lately, for when Mr. Ashwell was here, he was the objt. of yr. ridicule. He sd. “You and Mr. Ashwell are a pair of you,” &amp;c. I replied, “You must think, Sir, and let think on this matter,” He sd. “for this 4 or 5 years you have behaved in this unbecoming manner &amp;c” I sd. that I again repeated it, that his lads had ever behd. most insultingly to me, and more than that, that no other Missy. wod. have retd. Natives in his employ that had so repeatedly behd. themselves amiss to a brother Missy. as his lads had behd. to Mr A &amp; myself”.—He sd. “I was never so insulted by anyone in all my life as by Mr. Ashwell, save yourself.” I repeated— “Our convn. had better end here, after what he had sd.” He sd. “Yr. conduct has been most extraordinary”—I said— “That, Sir, is a mild &amp; bland expressn. after what you have just said—I pray you don’t back out of your repeated assertions in that kind of way Sir.” At this he rejoined with increasg. warmth— “I tell you, that the strongest possible terms I know of cannot convey the Insolence of your language and your improper conduct to me before the Natives.” (this was accompd. with peculiar gestures of his fist, the skirts of his dressing gown, &amp;c &amp;c, all which declamn. only convinced me more deeply that he was in a great passion)—I then sd. “You will bear witness of my calmness under all this—I have only to say, “I wish I had some witness to your repeated expressions, or that you wod. give me those words in writing”—He exclaimed, “Write them down, I’ll sign them.”—He was then going out, and he asked me again to give up the B., I firmly repd. not without an utu as I did in the affair of the pails. [He had before sd. that he wod. give the lad a new B. &amp; chge it to my a/c—when I repd. I wod. not allow it—&amp; sd. that if he gave his lad a new B. I wod. give mine a reward for doing what he had done,—he sd. that my lad wod. not have touched Pare’s (?) blanket, if he had he wod. have been “gobbled up”—I sd. if P. had laid hands on my boy I wod. have laid hands on P.—he said that P. was a Goliath—well sd. I gt Goliath was overcome by little David; that I knew not whose garmt. it was, save it was that of an offender, and that the boy was his, and that I blamed my lad for not bringing me more—he sd. if it had been so his lads shod. have been Muru for Muru”]</p>
         <p>I then sd. “You will please bear in mind, Sir, in conseq. of these assertions of yours, that all our convn. on any subject must henceforth be at an end.”—to this he replied, “certainly so”—I again repd. the Sentence, layg. emphasis on “You will <hi rend="italic">please bear in mind, Sir</hi>,”—and adding “Unless you retract those words”—to which he replied— “That I’ll never do unless you make an apology”—To which I repd. “It is most laughable, Sir, to think you cod. suppose such a thing”—</p>
         <p>Here our convn. ended.</p>
         <p>Blessed be the <hi rend="smallcaps">lord</hi>! for keepg. me throughout in calmness and collectedness. Oh, <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, do thou pardon all thou didst see amiss in me, and do thou pardon thy servt. W. also, givg. him to see his errors.</p>
         <p>“Exurgat Deus!”</p>
         <p>(written within 2 hours after the convn. took place)</p>
         <p>Augt. 10/39.—3 P.M., sent for by Revd. H.W. to go to see him at the Kotekotinga, to take also my lad Kauri, went, overtook him on the rocks—went on together, arrd. there, Mr. W. sd. “Now Mr. C. point out the 2 logs you spoke of”—I repd. “I had nothing to say <hi rend="italic">now </hi>in this matter” My boy sd. “Tena te rakau i tatakia; na te tai ia i kawe ai ki reina” went to it—Mr. W. asked my lad who had sawn it—“Matou”—who saw his lad chop it—“Naku”—when—“I te ra honi ware—when did you muru him— “Nonapo”—why did you leave it so long— “Naku i mea kia purangatia nga wahie ki reina, nga wahie i tatakia ai, a muri iho haue mai ana ratau, tangohia ai, na reina au ka wakatakairi ai, &amp;c—“ Mr. W. turned to me &amp; sd. “You see Mr.C. the damage done, &amp;c—I repd. I had nothing to say abt. it—I had now for the first time heard the story from Kauri, I had not sent the lad to muru—and he (Mr.W.) had already from the morng’s. proceedgs. put the case out of my power. Mr.W. asked me to give up the B. I sd. No I would not give it up [unconditionally]—after what had already passed: that things were now come to a crisis. He sd. he shod. mentn. the matter to 2 or 3 indivds.—I<hi rend="italic"> </hi>repd. I intend to bring it bef. the Committee. He sd. “after being so many years in the work, I wouldn’t think of asking a second time such a boy as you”—I made no reply—but fell back a bit.</p>
