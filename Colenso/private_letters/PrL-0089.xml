         <p>This Letter was written at Port Nicholson, at the house of Governor Eyre, on the 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> of June was it written, 1850.—</p>
         <p>To Christian Takamoana, to Thompson Peka Peka, to Leonard Kawepo. O Sirs, Listen hither: this is a word of mine to you. My writing to you is not because I have heard of the ill-treatment which your Minister has received at your hands. O Sirs, listen hither, my sorrow is not a common sorrow, it is a very great sorrow indeed. Yes, indeed, that you did not esteem your Minister and allow him to remain in peace. You did not consider that a Minister’s work is to do good, and this it is which induces them to settle down in the midst of the Natives.—Notwithstanding I have nothing now to say, because I consider that the ill treatment of your whiteman has been fully made up to him: that is, that new thoughts have arisen, good thoughts. That it is all over by this time, and that no such thing will take place again. That is all.</p>
         <p>                               From Governor Eyre,</p>
         <p>                               From the Governor of Port Nicholson,</p>
