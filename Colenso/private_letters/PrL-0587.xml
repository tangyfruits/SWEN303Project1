         <p rend="end">Napier Tuesday night <lb/>Jan 6th 1885</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I hope I am not too late to wish you, and yours, a happy New Year,—which I most heartily do now.</p>
         <p>I wrote to you just before Xmas,—and so I am not in your debt for letter writing. I purpose leaving for the Bush (my Highland Home;) on Friday next, &amp; I suppose I shall be absent thro all January; and so I write to let you know. If you should have both spare (?) time &amp; a heart to write to me there—at Norsewood—I shall be glad to get a letter from you and will do my best to reply.­—</p>
         <p>I think you sent me, last yr specimens of a small Grassy-leaved soft slender plant,bearing little white flowers, &amp; which I (in reply) said was <hi rend="italic">Arthropodium candidum</hi>—well I have 2 spns growing &amp; flowering from roots from the woods,—and if you fall in with any more—flowers or fruit, or root—please remember me. I think we have a third species. Mr Hill brought me a plant or two from Tarawera (also a lot of your broad-leaved Moss), but in a damaged state;—.</p>
         <p>By last mail Home I sent two pretty large papers on our <hi rend="italic">new</hi> plants to the Linnæan &amp; other Societies; and if they are published by them (which I suppose they will be, as they invited them,) &amp; I get copies, you shall have a copy.—I have been <hi rend="italic">very</hi> busy of late, day &amp; night.<note xml:id="ftn3-288" place="foot" n="288"> Colenso refers to his Linnæan Society paper (see 22 November 1884 letter to Balfour) which was read but not published, and to a sentimental paper on Cornish botany written on the eve of his 50th Chritmas in NZ, and submitted to the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society</hi>, but not published .</note>
         </p>
         <p>A gentleman from the Country was here yesterday seeing me, he said he is going to resign membership, &amp; asked the way:—I said, Just write a line to treasurer Bowerman, that will do, but be sure to do it <hi rend="italic">this month</hi> of Jan. I have to send in the withdrawal of my 2 sons, (owing to my treatment) &amp; I hear of <hi rend="italic">several</hi> others:—I would too, were it not for the <hi rend="italic">reference</hi> Library.­—</p>
         <p>I hope your silence is not owing to illness; I suppose you are as us­ual, <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>;—</p>
         <p>I have not see P.D. for 2 months. I am pretty well, &amp; hope you and are are so, too. And now</p>
         <p>With kind regards</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly </p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
