         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Napier,<lb/>Augt. 22 1857</p>
         <p>I.E. Featherstone<lb/>Esq, &amp;c &amp;c<lb/>Superintendent.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your kind note of June 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. I received in the Land Office on the day of the Land sale. I fear you will scarcely credit me when I tell you, that, with the sole exception of the “Esther,” which sailed almost immediately afterwards, no Mail since has been sent from this place to Wellington! As however we are now hourly looking-out for the “W.Wonga,” on her return from Auckland, I willingly avail myself of the opportunity to thank you for your note: and (while I much regret the circumstance of my Report being somewhat adverse to your Honor’s views respecting the road through the 40m. Bush,) I wish to assure you, that the Government may always depend upon my ever-present hearty wish to be of service. As to your publishing my Report—pray do so, if you approve of it. Allow me however, in the event of its being Printed, to request a couple of copies. In fact, I should greatly like to receive regularly a copy of the Govt. Gazette (seeing they often contain highly useful information): I have more than once written to Wellington to purchase Copies, but have rarely ever been successful.—</p>
         <p>On Mr. Stafford’s arrival (shortly after your Honor had left us), I, of course, waited on him; and, among other things talked of by us, during our short conversation, was the Botany &amp; Exploration of N. Zealand.—He said, there were no funds for the purpose: I even offered to accept so small a sum as £<hi rend="italic">50. </hi>a year, <hi rend="italic">in aid</hi>: but he spoke slightly of Botany &amp; of its kindred Natural Sciences.—I almost fear, that the <hi rend="italic">dulce</hi> stands a chance of being clean forgotten in the constant caring for the <hi rend="italic">utile</hi>: Goethe (I think) has it— “we should take care of the Beautiful for the Useful will take care of itself”:—and perhaps future years may reveal, (to the shame of the first Colonists of N.Z.,) that the British &amp; Continental Museums will necessarily have to be visited by the N.Z. student of the Natural Sciences of his own Country!</p>
         <p>Doubtless you will have heard of the increasing jars of the Natives of this neighbourhood—(those Natives who, a short time back, were spoken of as the first in N.Z. for quietness &amp; discipline!)—well: on Tuesday last, the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst., they fought in a skirmishing kind of way, (on the fern plain at the W. end of the large wood near this place, where they have been about,) and the result was, 7 killed on the spot, 1 mortally, 2 dangerously, &amp; several slightly wounded.—This, I fear, will prove to be only the beginning of things. It is a very great pity that such a mere handful of Natives should have been allowed to proceed thus far. I am not aware of a single Magistrate, nor the R.M., ever having once visited them. And I regret to have to add, that the party disaffected to British Rule had the best of it (although they lost 3 on the field); consequently they are now more arrogant than ever. I have spent 2 days among them all (Wedy. &amp; Friday), during which time a kind of truce has been observed to allow of their burying the dead: and, as I have never lowered my tone, I have had, as a matter of course, a deal of insolence &amp;c, &amp;c, to bear. Hapuku and his party, (ever the friends of the Settler &amp; of Govt.,) although the chief losers, have sought for peace, but the others, flushed as they now are, won’t hear of it; unless Hapuku will consent to leave his village <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>—in which he has dwelt 13 years!!</p>
         <p>Mr. McLean (who went to Auckland in the steamer and who is expected by her,) <hi rend="italic">may</hi>, it is to be hoped, yet be of service—but no N. Zealander (no Polynesian?) is ever to be won by gifts, or kindness, (especially when once they begin to be suspicious or discontented): more of the <hi rend="italic">suaviter</hi> is needed in dealing with them.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
