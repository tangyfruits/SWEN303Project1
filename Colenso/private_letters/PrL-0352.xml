         <p>Mr. John Davidson<lb/>West Clive</p>
         <p>Sir</p>
         <p>For some considerable time I have been thinking about your eldest son, whom I have often met at the West Clive School,—and now that my School Visitation for this year is over, I have thought it to be my duty to write you a few lines concerning him.—</p>
         <p>Of course, I do not know your intentions concerning your son,—but, should you determine on keeping him at school a little longer, (which I should strongly advise,) I would recommend you to place him at once at some School where there are boys of his age and older, and where (no doubt) he would get on much more rapidly,—as he ought to have been much farther advanced than he now is.</p>
         <p>Feeling interested in the lad, I have taken upon me to write to you about him;—      I remain,<lb/>                                  Your mo. ob. servt<lb/>                                         Wm. Colenso,<lb/>                                                       Inspector Schools.</p>
