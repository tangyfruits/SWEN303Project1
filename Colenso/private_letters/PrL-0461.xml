         <p rend="end">Napier, Sunday Aug 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1881</p>
         <p>Mr J. Drummond</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>To ensure your getting a letter from me by next (Wednesdays) mail, I write <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. No doubt you expected one by yesterdays mail—but it was impossible—our Eng mail closed yesterday morning, &amp; that al­ways gives me plenty to do. I sent you however, a D.T. paper yester­day, which I hope you received, as it will have told you a little about <hi rend="italic">us.</hi> But I must “hie back” and begin at the beginning.</p>
         <p>And that is a <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> one; In your letter of Aug 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> (the last) you men­tion the receiving of mine on the 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> July; well, the next morning, (24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) while sitting <hi rend="italic">quietly at breakfast</hi>, I was suddenly &amp; unexpectedly struck with lumbago; I could not move in any way, &amp; my two servants came in &amp; got me, first on the sofa &amp; then to bed. In bed I remained some days, but getting about at and of week with a stick, &amp;c, and found your kind letter of August 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. This found me slowly getting round. I only had my boots on 3 times in 4 weeks. I was pleased to get your letter, &amp; subse­quently, the bottle in its case, all right. During that week I found, that <hi rend="italic">I must</hi> take the work at our meeting on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. or there would be <hi rend="italic">none;</hi> (unfortunately we have no “emergency men” in our Club); so, among other things, I got ready your spiders for the occasion, &amp; they cau­sed much interest. I took out the biggest fellow &amp; displayed it well on a card, &amp; the others I put into Spirits. But I had the <hi rend="italic">Books to refer to,</hi> particularly Vol VIII of “Transactions”, which contains an aw­fully long winded account of the trap-door spider at Otago (over 40 pages but some of it is really good). Although I had but small time (&amp; less ability under the circumstances) for examination, I saw enough to assure me that your spider is a <hi rend="italic">different</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">one</hi> from that, and now I want some more of them from you at no distant date.</p>
         <p>I have <hi rend="italic">roughly</hi> copied for you from the drawings in Vol VIII, of the nest of the Otago spiders; so see what you can find of yours. It cunningly keeps its <hi rend="italic">door shut</hi> when inside, (said to be holding on) it is lined with silk (web) and so is the tube-like nest, and there at Otago they are found in swampy ground. In burrowing deep, it brings up the sub­soil (yellow clay), but it is careful to carry it off <hi rend="italic">from</hi> its door or entrance,—though sometimes it is found there, &amp; then the spider is said to bite down bits of leaves &amp; straws, &amp; bind them to conceal it; They have been found by scores at Otago, and it is supposed they come out by night to prey, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Among these you sent me is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> smaller &amp; slender one; Did you got this one also out of the earth?. Be sure to let me have all the differ­ent kinds you may come across, small or large. I hope, through you, to be able to get up a paper on them for Vol XIV;—Note all you can, everything, about them, their nests, their habits, &amp;c, &amp;c—and do they fall on their backs, &amp; feign death? many spiders do.</p>
         <p>I am glad to find that you have Methy Spirits with you,—that is­ the proper thing to drop them into; but, if you wish to kill them qui­ckly, drop them into <hi rend="italic">boiling</hi> water, when they are dead instantly; then, afterward, let them drain on a bit of rag &amp; put them into the spirits.</p>
         <p>I think the <hi rend="italic">better</hi> (easier &amp; cheaper) mode of sending them to me, will be for you to take them out of your spirits bottle onto a bit of rag to drain, &amp; put them into (say) a tin plate match box, putting in, first, a very thin layer of wool, or of <hi rend="italic">cotton</hi>,—such will keep well enough for 24–36 hours to reach me. Wrap your tin lox in a bit of paper and cord it &amp; put my name on it, but <hi rend="italic">no</hi> stamp <hi rend="italic">on the box</hi>, the stamp (1d will do) must be on a bit of card, say 1½ or 2 ins long, bearing also my name,    &amp; tied by a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> string (hanging loosely) to the box. We manage many things in this way; put enough wool, or cotton, loosely into the box to keep them from rattling or shaking, &amp; I break them in, any way.</p>
         <p>I am much intereated in Mrs Drummonds <hi rend="italic">Lizard</hi>,—and if there is any chance thereaway of securing one (you speak of children there) I will <hi rend="italic">give ₤3 for a specimen</hi>—dead or alive, but unbroken. Several animals run backwards as well to forward, though having only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> head;—on some kinds of House Spiders, here, crabs, shrimps, &amp; crayfish <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">water</hi>, &amp; lizards too, on land. Dogs too, when <hi rend="italic">retreating</hi>, backing.</p>
         <p>I was greatly pleased in finding you had got relief from using Sulphuric. I believe I shall take it up tomorrow. I omitted to say, that, although it was raining I got pretty well on Monday night to our meeting, but the attendance was large, the room warm (fire &amp; gas) and I, of course, had <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to do; well, while I was reading my paper, &amp;c, Kinross opened the window <hi rend="italic">at my back</hi>; and I caught a cold, which brought back rheumatism all over, though not lumbago and so I have been till now. I have lots of writing &amp;c to do, &amp; feel a little depressed which is unusual. <hi rend="italic">Note</hi> particularly, the <hi rend="italic">colours</hi> of the spiders while living, &amp; whether <hi rend="italic">altered </hi>in the spirits.</p>
         <p>I was pleased to see in W. Mail that you did well at your shooting match. Please remember me to Mrs Drummond and to your dear <hi rend="italic">bairnie also</hi> (you know <hi rend="italic">how</hi>) and with kind regards &amp; best wishes.</p>
         <p>     Believe me</p>
         <p>             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso</p>
