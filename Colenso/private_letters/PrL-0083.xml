         <p>Mr. W. Morris. </p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Returning to my Station a few days ago, after my usual long autumnal rambling (upwards of 90 days)—I found among other welcome Letters one from you—and now that I am about to send a Native on to Turanga, I must find time to write a line to thank you for the same.—</p>
         <p>Since you left our neighbourhood, I have very often indeed had you in my thoughts;—and had heard you were coming back again to Rangaika, which pleased me not a little; for I have proved you to be a good neighbour, and am still indebted to you for many little acts of kindness.—</p>
         <p>The goods you so kindly brought me, I duly and safely received; the Cooper brought them in his boat to the door—following out, as it were, your kind example.—Of course you will receive freightage for them from Mr. Williams—who has generally paid freightages from Poverty, I repaying him again.</p>
         <p>It is now very wet &amp; stormy; the Gipsy is undergoing repair at Ahuriri, and was very nearly lost, in the late severe weather, off the Cape.</p>
         <p>Mr. Kier has left me at last,—he went away about 2 months ago, during my absence; he has bought some Land in the Rangitikei River, where, I suppose, he will eventually settle down. I feel as if I had lost an arm, now that he is gone—for I scarcely know any thing about the stores or their places.—</p>
         <p>I hope you are doing well and that your Children with yourself enjoy good health. We have very much of sickness about us. I am thinking of removing to Waimarama, which place has several advantages—I want a warmer &amp; dryer spot than this.</p>
         <p>May <hi rend="smallcaps">God </hi>bless you my good old neighbour Morris, and give you to see &amp; know that true treasure Jesus Christ,—may you find <hi rend="italic">when in your need</hi>—whenever that may be—that you live in Jesus, through God’s mercy, <hi rend="italic">all </hi>you need—a friend who sticketh closer that a Brother. A line from you will always give me pleasure.</p>
         <p>Believe me, ever sincerely yours<lb/>                  William Colenso.</p>
