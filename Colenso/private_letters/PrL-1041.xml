         <p rend="end">Napier, Saturday <hi rend="italic">night</hi>,<lb/>April 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>, 1898.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding—</p>
         <p>I think I will scribble <hi rend="italic">you </hi>a kind of “<hi rend="italic">extra</hi>”, not exactly in reply to your last,—but to the day &amp; times.—</p>
         <p>This week has been one of disappointments, &amp; of solemn memories to me. (<hi rend="italic">Here</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> however</hi>, to begin with, my disapps. must my <hi rend="italic">not hearing</hi> from you in your last of your having recd. mine of last week—posted by myself early on Friday mg., so I, at <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, had supposed somehow it was lost—but the receipt of the 2 Books written on <hi rend="italic">Tuesday </hi>dispelled that cloud.)</p>
         <p>2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. Disapt.) On Monday <hi rend="underline italic">night</hi> R.D.D. McL. kindly called, on his return from Hastings &amp; Waipatu, to get me to go with him &amp; Mrs. McL. to Waipatu—to the big meeting there, on Tuesday—by train to Hastings, to Waipatu with them in their wagonette—bringing me also a card from Mrs. Donelly &amp; assuring me an Invitation had been duly posted: I was unwilling but at last assented: however at X, p.m. I wrote him a note (sent up early next mg.) <hi rend="italic">declining </hi>it, although I had <hi rend="italic">now</hi> received the <hi rend="italic">handsome</hi> Invitation from P.O. signed by her, &amp; H. Toomoana. My sole reasons were, my physical <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi>, &amp; the <hi rend="italic">length of meeting</hi> in open air (Maori &amp; <hi rend="italic">Seddon</hi> speechifying) and so returning <hi rend="italic">late</hi>—I find 2 hours out, <hi rend="italic">here in town</hi>, as much as I can well stand.–</p>
         <p>3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. Disappt.) Bower had inserted advt. in paper—public reception of Govr. Wedy. mg. 10.30: <hi rend="italic">no</hi> levee, but those who wished to see Govr. &amp;c, to send in their cards to B.—by IV p.m. on Tuesday: I sent in mine on Monday, and in my note to B., said, “If weather <hi rend="italic">unfair</hi>, <hi rend="italic">not present</hi>.” My man engd. trap on Tuesday to come for me at X. on Wedy. The mg. fine, I got ready—<hi rend="italic">no trap </hi>came!! Bob went to town—found <hi rend="italic">my </hi>(I only use 2) traps <hi rend="italic">engaged</hi>—one with hearse, &amp; one w. mourners, at a funeral at IX.30! at XI.5, a trap came, I got down, but <hi rend="italic">all </hi>(outside) show was <hi rend="italic">over</hi>, &amp; Govr. <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>, and I laughed at! many hundreds there. What next? all shops shut up: no friend’s house to visit—to wait for Lunch hour, I.30,—and so I came back: here in paddock met w. McL. who had been kindly looking me up—either to return at I.30, or go up to <hi rend="italic">his house </hi>at III p.m. to see the Govr. McL. strove hard &amp; kindly—but I refused, feeling weak already.</p>
         <p>4. Disappt.) Watching the Papers I found, that Seddon would stay at Hastings on <hi rend="italic">Tuesday night</hi>, and go to Waipatu on <hi rend="italic">Wedy. </hi>to see Maoris, but on <hi rend="italic">Wedy. evg.</hi> (D.T.) I found that S. had (for <hi rend="italic">once</hi>) made a very short stay at Waipatu,—was at the Lunch!—and would leave for Huntly on Thursday mg. (Now I had calculated on S. staying some time) However I scrawled a hasty note &amp; sent Bob. down to ask, If Mr. S. could grant me a brief interview,— “Yes, after X.” Away I went, &amp; saw him (before others—waiting): very kind to me. My first was, “Why he did not ansr. my letter of February?” Heigh ho! Didn’t he open on his priv. secy. (not the one present). S. had given instructions to do so, (Mentioning them, and also the <hi rend="italic">contents</hi> of my note! good memory) Just this, he said— “What no. of copies I wod. allow the Govt. to take?” I said, “As many as he (or they) please: I did not publish <hi rend="italic">for sale</hi>”: S. wished to have a copy for each member, &amp;c. I mentioned the arrangement I had early made w. Costall— “500 self &amp; the Govt. to fix their no., &amp;, that I supposed, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> had <hi rend="italic">been acted on</hi>, as the work had been worked off”: S. said, “NO: type <hi rend="italic">still standing </hi>for Govt. copies”. (I could hardly swallow <hi rend="italic">this</hi>—but <hi rend="italic">no time</hi> for much talk.) I mentioned how I had wished to have had some copies—for friends, &amp; Libraries &amp;c, &amp;c, on continent, and at Home—for Sir G.G., &amp;c, &amp;c. S. <hi rend="italic">kindly</hi> proposed, that “I should give him the names of those Libraries, and that <hi rend="italic">he </hi>would get copies out”. At first I demurred—but gave in. S. <hi rend="italic">may</hi> return to Wgn. by N., and, if so, I shall see him again.—</p>
         <p>Now I have told <hi rend="italic">you all</hi>—or given you a fair &amp; full outline, and I want you to give me a <hi rend="underline italic">List of foreign &amp; Home Libraries</hi>—not, of course, all, say 40–60, or so,—as I shall be partly guided by those at <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of “Trans.” vols., on receivers of N.Z. Inst. “Trans.” free:—and also, (if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi>) whether type is <hi rend="italic">still standing</hi>!! which I doubt, because, at an early date, 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi> proofs had <hi rend="italic">turned</hi> letters waiting for former sheet, or form, to be worked off.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">5</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. Disappt</hi>.) I had arranged to go inland, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Govr. &amp; S. should leave, had written to that effect, (being 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. arrangement!) and on my seeing Loughnan (Waipawa) in town on Thursday, agreed to see him at W. on Wednesday next: yet, on mature consideration afterwards <hi rend="italic">here</hi>—noting, the ½ holiday on Wedy.—Good Friday, Pigeon shooting club, Waipukurau Saty., &amp; Annual Races <hi rend="italic">there</hi> on E. Monday, &amp; so on! I once more altered—wrote to L., &amp; put off my going awa’ until <hi rend="italic">after Easter holidays </hi>(<hi rend="underline italic">not mine</hi>).</p>
         <p>And then came <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi>, “<hi rend="italic">April 1</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">st</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">.</hi>” my anniversary day of all but fatal consequences at Woodville! can I ever forget—here below—those <hi rend="italic">first </hi>strange days &amp; nights of suffering, &amp; semi-delirium?—I have been endeavouring afresh, &amp; continually, to offer the <hi rend="italic">sacrifice </hi>of thanksgiving to almighty <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>—<hi rend="italic">our Father</hi>—for His mercies to me on <hi rend="italic">that occasion &amp; since</hi>: I have indeed <hi rend="italic">much </hi>to be thankful for and I trust I am—in some small degree. In letters I wrote yesty. to a few friends, I asked them, individually, to join with me in thkg.—and now <hi rend="italic">to you</hi> I put the same request.—</p>
         <p>I sent you 3 Heralds—that you might know a little of our doings. Here I must stop. Let me have the <hi rend="italic">List</hi> as early as convenient, as I have to prepare it for S.—</p>
         <p>And now Good night! May <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> bless you &amp; yours.—</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>(<hi rend="italic">Supplement.</hi>)</p>
         <p>Sunday, 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>—Looking over what I wrote last night, I may give you a little more. I omitted, the <hi rend="italic">kind &amp; full Invitation</hi> I had from the Mayor, on Tuesday, to hear public Lunch w. Govr.; also, while I was absent in town w. Seddon on Thursday mg. Mr. McL. called to see me, &amp; told Housekpr. of his convn. w. Govr. respg. me, &amp; my <hi rend="italic">not</hi> being at reception &amp; Lunch—&amp; she at last told him, to write it in a note for she cod. not remr. it (!!!) and he promised to do so—he was on his way to go by str. to Wgn. </p>
         <p>S. <hi rend="italic">sadly</hi> disappd. Maoris at Waipatu: he did go there (as promised) on Wedy. mg., but having said his say—a long one—<hi rend="italic">left them to consider it</hi>!!! (he could not have done a worse thing, accordg. to Maori etiquette.) I wish to see him—at <hi rend="italic">his leisure</hi>, on Maori matters. If I had seen the Govr. I should have told him—I had welcomed <hi rend="italic">1</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">st</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>Govr. to N.Z. &amp; also was (2 days) at Sg. Ty. Waitangi, &amp;c &amp;c—and perhaps <hi rend="italic">a little more</hi>!</p>
         <p>If S. should return by N., very likely my visit inland may be again put off! A letter to hand, from <hi rend="italic">Eccles, </hi>full of thanks for booklet—wanting to know when I may be seen at Wdv., &amp; informing me of Mrs. Eccles having given him <hi rend="italic">another</hi> boy! Beck, also, has sent me a note of thanks for copy of booklet,—late, owing to his being absent, down S. Will it surprise you to hear of <hi rend="italic">Dr. Sidey</hi> paying me a visit? I spent a pleasant hour on Tuesday, &amp; he has promised to come again, though the hill tries him: he is <hi rend="italic">now </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">Chn</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">.</hi> E.B. in Ormond’s place, rightly too. The E.B. won’t hear of Hill’s going to Vict. College; Hill, I fancy, will <hi rend="italic">kick</hi>. Sad case of <hi rend="italic">murder</hi> of twins at Hastings, both parents in gaol on that charge! Do you recollect <hi rend="italic">Prebble</hi>, Senr.? In hospital to undergo <hi rend="italic">serious </hi>operation tomorrow—in stomach. </p>
         <p>Have not yet looked into the 2 books you sent me, hope to, w. <hi rend="italic">Spencer’s</hi>, this wk. I also sent a copy booklet to <hi rend="italic">T.C.W.</hi> &amp; recd. a good <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> reply from Archdn. S., for his copy.—Once more Good Bye. Hope you &amp; yours are <hi rend="italic">all well.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Yours ever,                                              W. Colenso</p>
         <p>Did you ever see, “<hi rend="italic">Death &amp; after</hi>”? by Sir Edwin Arnold. <hi rend="italic">I have it</hi>.</p>
