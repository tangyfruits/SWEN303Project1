         <p>A. Luff Esq.,</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I was very glad to see your own well-known hand-writing again, after so long a deprivation! and (may I say it) better pleased to find that you were all well!—a great mercy.</p>
         <p>You mention your coming this way early, and “probably next week” (viz. this week). I scarcely need to say how glad I shall be to see you &amp;c., &amp;c. but I have made an arrangement for the country for <hi rend="italic">next </hi>week—leaving here Thursday 15<hi rend="sup ">th.</hi>, &amp; staying away from 4 to 6 days, and this I cannot alter; so I just write to let you know. I had made this arrangement in Decr.,—still, if parties keep their words, I may not have to go at all, and I do not wish to do so—but I fear I must.</p>
         <p>Last night I received a note from Lambert (Porangahau) saying he would be at N. &amp; see me next week—and I have just written to him as above; and so I thought I would just drop you a line also.</p>
         <p>Hoping this may find you all quite well, and that you will continue to keep in good health after your long voyage.</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>Yours ever,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
