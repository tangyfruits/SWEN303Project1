         <p rend="end">Church Mission Station,</p>
         <p rend="end">Waitangi, New Zealand</p>
         <p rend="end">April 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1853</p>
         <p>My Dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>1. My last Letter to you was dated Jany. 31 and Feby. 7, 1853, which, enclosures, I hope you will safely receive.</p>
         <p>2. On the 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> of March last the Rev. S. Williams arrived here. He took up his residence at Te Pokara, (a small native village about a musket shot from this Station,) where, in consequence of information received by the Natives, preparation had been made for him. On his way hither he spent a week with the Natives inland, chiefly at Te Rotoatara with Wi Tipuna’s tribe, to which party (including my 2 runaway domestics,) he administered the Sacrament of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Supper.—On his arrival here, at Te Pakonoa, he called to see us, (Mrs Colenso &amp; myself), and remained a few minutes; but neither then nor at any subsequent call, did he speak a word to me about the Natives or our work. In <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> matters he acted as if I were either dead or had never had any thing <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> to do with the people! He refused to stay on the Station (although I offered him the use of the Study); neither would he eat with us; we sent him, however, a share of what food we had as he required it. <hi rend="bold">[2]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>3. Shortly before his arrival (and during his stay inland, where he remained several days awaiting the Bishop,) we heard—that the Bishop &amp; the Governor were on the way hither from Wellington “coming purposely to drive me off”! At first I paid no attention to the report, although I soon saw that it gradually made a wonderful difference in the manner of the natives towards me; which alienation was greatly increased through the incessant talking of the natives of Te Pakonoa village, who are mostly of the Ngati te Upokoiro Tribe, migrated hither from the Manawatu river, where they were Baptized by the Revd. Messrs. Govett &amp; S. Williams. These Natives had never greatly liked me, principally because of my having put down my old N. Teacher Leonard Te Kawepo, (who is a Chief of that Tribe,) and, because I would not—until last August—admit them to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Supper. They were soon joined by all the old “grumblers”—in particular by the Chiefs Christian Takamoana, Thompson Pekapeka, Te Waka Te Kawatini, and Tereha—whose names have often, alas! been mentioned in my past journals with any other mark than that of approbation. They were also informed, or had concluded among themselves, that unless they were now unanimous for driving me off they should not get the incoming Minister to reside <hi rend="italic">here</hi> among them; and, as with the Civil &amp; Ecclesiastical heads were coming for that <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>purpose, they of course, could not act contrarily. However, on my learning, on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ulto., from a few friendly Natives, that Mr. S. Williams himself had been inciting the Natives to drive me away, I desired them to go immediately to him, and plainly to ask, whether he had ever said such a thing? Which they did, publicly; when he denied having done so; yet allowed to them, (and subsequently to me,) that he had said it would be much better if I would withdraw quietly!!—which, in the Native language especially, means a great deal.—</p>
         <p>4. In the afternoon of the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ulto. the Governor, Sir George Grey, the Bishop, &amp; several respectable Europeans (Hon’ble. Mr. Tallemache, Mr. Valentine-Smith &amp; others,) arrived here <hi rend="italic">at Te Pakonoa </hi>from Wellington. We had previously heard of their having spent Sunday the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. at Te Waipukurau;—of their visit to Te Aute, where, on the border of the Government Land, a block had been selected for a “College” by the Bishop, and given by the Governor; to which, however, the Native Chiefs were to add an equal sized piece from their side of the boundary;—of the promise of 500 sheep by the Governor ;—ditto of <hi rend="italic">tithes </hi>from Mr. Tallemache, who is to have the adjoining Land;—and ditto of a new Resident Minister from the Bishop, &amp;c., &amp;c. Consequently scarcely any Natives—save a few poor old folk—now <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>cared to see <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Still I must not omit to mention the unexpected kindness from the Popish-protecting Chief Puhara, and also that of the Heathen Chief Te Hapuku (although they have for a long while been open enemies of mine), who, this morning, made strong orations to the Bishop when at their village with the Governor, deprecating my removal: this, Puhara, came himself this afternoon to tell me!—Also, a letter from the principal Chief of Tangoio, Tamaiawitere, telling me, that if I was driven away from this place and would go to him, he would give me a piece of Land to live on!—And, that some Natives who had returned from Ahuriri brought the Natives here word, that the Magistrates there had publicly expressed their indignation at their most ungrateful conduct towards me.—At Sunset the bell rang for Evening Prayer, when the Bishop, (in passing our hut in his way to the Chapel) called, and abruptly told Mrs Colenso, (I being in the Garden) that my little child should be taken away from me the next morning!!—and that he would call in again after Prayers. On Mrs Colenso’s informing me of what the Bishop had said—I sickened to my very soul, and forboded much evil. I, however, fled again to prayers, &amp; prayed for the grace of meekness and quietness, and for deliverance. After prayers, he again called, accompanied by Rev. S. Williams, and examined me <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>until,—I think, past one o’clock the next morning.—It was a sad sad time: I never wish to see the Bishop again, unless it may please <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> to convert him. At first he used a great deal of kind language—that he was “come out of parental love &amp; kindness,” &amp;c., &amp;c., “if I would but be counselled by him,”—which kindness soon displayed itself to mean,—<hi rend="underline italic">no hope</hi>—as, <hi rend="italic">I never should be restored</hi>! He pressed me, over &amp; over again, to consent to his 4 proposals— 1. To leave the premises immediately:—2. To go out of the District:—3. To give up my child immediately to the mother:—4. To consent to abide by the Letter of the Central Commee., whatever it might be. To none of them, however, would I consent.</p>
         <p>Not to the 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>., because I have no other home, and because I had written to you stating that I should remain here until I heard from you, and, also from the fact of this site not being again wanted for a Mission Station, not to mention the great expense and labor I had incurred upon it.</p>
         <p>Nor to the 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>., that if it should come to that that you would quite disconnect me from your service (which I did not yet quite believe), there is no other place in all N. Zealand so suitable for me to endeavour to gain a livelihood in, as this District, for which, too, I had done so much:—</p>
         <p>Nor to the 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>., because I could not conscientiously put my poor child (although illegitimate) <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>among the Natives to be by them brought up—or, rather, <hi rend="italic">to die</hi>; seeing they scarcely ever now rear any children, the mother, too, having ever shewn her self quite careless about it; and Mrs Colenso having constantly attended to it—<hi rend="italic">as its own mother</hi>—from the early age of 6 months; who had, also, given her opinion, that if <hi rend="italic">now</hi> given up to the careless natives—the winter too coming on—it must suffer much and inevitably perish:—</p>
         <p>Nor to the 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., because, that no sane person could properly so consent to abide by an <hi rend="italic">unknown</hi> document; and, because that I had been sent to N. Zealand by <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, who <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> had the right to dispose of me;—and, because that I had already written to you fully. Of course the Bishop was, as usual, very angry; especially at my having appealed to you: and, at my saying the premises (ground) was yours: he, stating that the Chiefs had given it <hi rend="italic">to him</hi>!! whereas the very contrary is clearly expressed in the deed, which Archd. W. Williams and myself drew up in December 1843,<note xml:id="ftn2-9" place="foot" n="9"> WC: <hi rend="italic">Vide</hi>, Journal, Decemr. 11/43.</note> (when I marked out the ground,) and which I have still in my possession. Among other things which he urged upon me was, To go to England to <hi rend="italic">see </hi>Socy.!—To go to some Colonial town and seek employ as a Printer, &amp;c.—and, among sundry unpleasant questions, he asked me,— “What if I should immediately acquire <hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>these premises for Mr. Williams?” To which, in answer, I begged him, for his own sake, to drop that question; as I did not wish him to get greater obliquy among the Settlers. Upon his again &amp; again declaring, that the child should be taken from me in the morning, (for which purpose some of Wi Tipuna’s people had come with him,)—although I begged repeatedly with <hi rend="italic">many </hi>tears, that he would not think of such an unnatural &amp; cruel thing, but to no purpose,—I, in order to prevent such an act, &amp;, also, to hinder mischief, consented that the dear infant should go with Mrs. Colenso, to her family near Auckland, (she, herself, being more than willing to continue to look after it,)—to which the Bishop at length assented. (He was now hourly expecting the Auckland vessel hence.) The Bishop also said, that he had seen a Letter I wrote to the N. Teachers at Wairarapa, in which I had tried to liken myself to Moses on the hills held up by Aaron &amp; therein requesting them so to hold me up by praying for me, daily, &amp; that he had spoken against it; and that he had told them not to come to visit me—and I told him, plainly, that he had dealt with me in an unchristian manner; that my hope was still in the Bishop of souls, before whom he would have to give an account of his dealings towards me; that I had labored long &amp; heavily in <hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>New Zealand before he came to it—reminding him of his <hi rend="italic">first </hi>question to me at the time of Ordination &amp; my answer—and, that <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> would never forsake me, &amp;c., &amp;c. It was very evident that both the Bishop and Mr. S. Williams (especially the latter) had not only received a good deal of false statements from Wi Tipuna’s party, but that they also had believed them!—And which, to my great grief, notwithstanding my repeated declarations, they continued to do.—</p>
         <p>5. The next morning (the 31<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>.) at x., all the Europeans left Te Pakonoa for Ahuriri, &amp; thence to Petani, on their way to Taupo. No one called in, in passing by the door, nor in any way noticed us. At night, Matthew Meke, the N. Teacher at Te Waipukurau, and others, his relations, (who had accompanied the Europeans as far as Ahuriri,) called to see us. Matthew told us, that they had also spoken to the Bishop on his way hither, begging him not to think of <hi rend="italic">removing</hi> me, as the love of the Christian Natives was great for me,—but, that the Bishop did not like their words.—</p>
         <p>6. But my cup was not yet drained (is it even <hi rend="italic">now</hi>?). On Saturday night, the 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. instant, after dark, Mr. S. Williams again called—to request me not to take unkindly what he had to say, namely—that I would <hi rend="bold">[9] </hi>not go to the Communion on the morrow!!—that the Bishop had forgotten to mention this, and that it was now done because of the Natives who would otherwise be greatly dissatisfied. I confess, I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> expect this. I paused a while ere I answered; when I replied,—That I had never absented myself from the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Supper since I was first admitted, 24 years ago—that, 3 years back was, (with reference to my offence) the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> time for me to have done so:—that, if the Bishop himself was present I should not now do so; but, that I would give way to his request, and, to please, stay away—I could say no more: so taking my poor child in my arms I once more went weeping, in the dark, to my study—to my refuge—prayer. Oh! my dear Sirs, what have I not suffered through my foolish transgression! <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> be merciful to me; a poor broken reed—and guide and deliver me:—Isaiah 50. 10.—</p>
         <p>7. Therefore, yesterday, (Sunday) I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go to Church, for I could not make up my mind to do so, and to turn my back upon the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> table:—in that building, too, of my own, &amp; before my own converts &amp; people. I trust, however, that I did not spend an unprofitable day at home. Today, several friendly Natives called, to condole, &amp;c. Te Hapuku, also, called in passing <hi rend="bold">[10] </hi>on Friday last; he, and his eldest Son, Cranmer, and some others, wish me to remove to the piece of Land adjoining to Te Aute at Te Rotoakiwa—which he gave me last year for you, but which has been refused by both the Bishop &amp; Mr. S. Williams; But I have no wish (even if I should remain in the District,) to be so near to any one to whom my presence is so hateful. At present I seek nothing better than quietly to remain where I am—where I shall be far enough off from both whites &amp; Natives; as the Natives of Te Pakonoa, my only neighbours, are about to remove inland 2 miles off—Although this Station and all the surrounding low country has been frightfully inundated—for more than a week—since I last wrote; through which heavy floods great damage has been done, especially to the Natives’ crops, much of their wheat &amp; potatoes having been destroyed.—</p>
         <p>8. In my Letter of Decr.10/52, para. 15, I ventured to express a hope that I might yet serve you though it were in some lower situation,—such as, “in Bible &amp; N. Teachers’ Classes &amp; Schools, &amp;c.”—but that hope is now vanished as far as regards this Country.—Unless it should please <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> to change the heart of the Bishop, or to bring my restoration about through one of His many &amp; wonderful ways of acting. There are, or may be, <hi rend="italic">other</hi> doors of usefulness open to me, (as a Xn. friend said to me in a Letter lately received,) but I am, and trust I shall ever be, an attached, though <hi rend="bold">[11] </hi>erring member of the Church of England. I wish—more than ever—to be <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> guided by the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>. I daily pray for a child-like trust and dependence upon Him, and I believe that <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> will graciously vouchsafe to answer this prayer of His own teaching—. My way, however, is now completely hedged-up; (and I must be content to abide quietly here for a season). Should you, my dear Sirs, <hi rend="underline italic">not</hi> be able to direct me into any situation in which to serve you, and only allow me the small sum of £20. pr ann., (as stated in my Letter &amp; paragraph aforementioned,) then I know of no other suitable place of residence than <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, where, for many reasons, I can live at a far less expense than any where else.—To say nothing of my flock whom <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> gave me, &amp; whom I still love. Could I have foreseen that such would have been the end of my long &amp; heavy labor (second to none) in this Country—I should long ago have provided an earthly refuge against the coming storm—for no one has had better opportunities of doing so than myself; to whom, a short time ago, all the <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> lands of this District were open &amp; available. But, I look to you: I have hope in you—and continually pray to the Searcher of hearts and Guide of His People, that <hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> will be graciously blessed to guide you in considering and deciding upon my unhappy case: for to your decision I must wholly submit.—</p>
         <p>9. I find, that Mr. Hutton of Wellington, <hi rend="bold">[12] </hi>has been appointed by the Bishop to visit Wairarapa every 2 months, and <hi rend="italic">I </hi>have heard, that Mr. S. Williams will also only visit here occasionally; and that the Bishop has written to a Minister at Port Cooper, (an elderly man and ignorant of the language,) to come here to reside.</p>
         <p>10. Before I conclude I must not omit to tell you one thing which has served to cheer me a little, namely, that not <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of your Converts here in this District has joined the Papists; which, considering all things, is a very remarkable instance, worthy of being recorded,—and one which the Priests themselves little expected, and cannot understand.—To <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> be all praise!</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>my dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>(Notwithstanding my sad error,)</p>
         <p>to be, your unalterably attached</p>
         <p>although unworthy Servant,</p>
