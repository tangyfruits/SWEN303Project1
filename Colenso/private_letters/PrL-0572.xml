         <p rend="end">Napier, August 13<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. 1884</p>
         <p>My dear Sir George Grey,</p>
         <p>Your kind and valued note of the 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. I duly received, and I thank you for it. As you have truly observed, I had thought that your perusal of this last little book would recall to mind <hi rend="italic">old times </hi>in N.Z.—of which you, in particular, have seen so much!—</p>
         <p>Agreeably with your request I send you, with this, your 4 remaining copies, and have also written my name in one (which is marked). I have detained them a while to go by Steamer hence on Saturday, as parcels get knocked about and damp in overland coach transit.—</p>
         <p>You kindly enquire the price: 4/. each, as stipulated in advertisement. There are a few copies left, which will be at the same figure to original subscribers, but 5/. to non-subscribers,—to meet the expense of extra printing: as I had only originally intended the little book to consist of 60 pp. There are also a few copies of the former book still on hand at 3/. ea.</p>
         <p>Knowing your busy and arduous political situation there at Wellington, I forebear saying anything more.—</p>
         <p>     Believe me, Dear Sir G. Grey,</p>
         <p>                                     Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                                                                     Wm. Colenso.</p>
