         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—The Government having appointed me to prepare for publication a Maori-English Lexicon (in conformity with a resolution of the House of Representatives), I have the honor to request you to invite the kind assistance those officers of the Government who may be acquainted with the Maori language or who are visiting Maori districts, in order to the more perfect as well as to the more speedy completion of the said work.</p>
         <p>You will find, Sir, on referring to correspondence which has taken place between the Government and myself on this subject—(particularly to my letter to the Hon. the Colonial Secretary, of 17th December, 1863, and and also to a subsequent letter to the Hon. the Native Minister, dated 5th July, 1865<note xml:id="ftn2-125" place="foot" n="125"> Maori documents of this period were destroyed in a fire.</note>)—that such valuable cooperation has been always by me considered so necessary to the better and early accomplishment of the Lexicon.</p>
         <p>Such efficient aid may be rendered many ways by those gentlemen, particularly by their forwarding to me—</p>
         <p>1. Any memoranda (however small or rough) which they may have already made of any local or strange Maori words or phrases, or of any peculiar local usage of common words.</p>
         <p>2. Or of any songs, proverbs, sayings or recitations: especially those that are old, local, or little known, or which may contain strange words or phrases (such as can be very well written by any intelligent Native).</p>
         <p>3. By sending me from time to time, any words or expressions which may appear to them to be local or strange, or peculiar use among the Natives of their respective districts.</p>
         <p>4. By pointing out to me those Maoris of their districts who they consider to be well qualified to become correspondents to assist me in my linguistic inquiries.</p>
         <p>5. And by stirring up and encouraging those Maoris to reply fully and promptly to all such inquiries when made by me.</p>
         <p>As it is my intention in the prosecution of this work hereafter to visit some of the less known Maori districts, those officers may also have it in their power still further to aid me in my inquiries, should I visit any district in which they may be resident or with which they may be connected.</p>
         <p>And, as a copious and complete Maori-English and English-Maori Lexicon is believed to be a work of very great utility to both races in the Colony, as well as of the highest importance to the scholar and philologist,—and as the want of such a work has long been felt,—it is confidently hoped that every possible assistance will be readily afforded by all who may have it in their power to aid in this truly National undertaking.</p>
         <p>I may also state, Sir, that it is purposed when the Lexicon is published, to give due individual acknowledgement to all who should have assisted in its preparation.</p>
         <p>             I have, &amp;c.</p>
