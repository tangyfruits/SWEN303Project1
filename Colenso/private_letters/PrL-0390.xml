         <p>Mr Balfour </p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Thanks for your very interesting note of June 18th which I have read 2–3 times over, &amp; considered also your outlines of stones. I shall be pleased to receive them in due time (as you say)—I leave all that to you, but if you could <hi rend="italic">better</hi> manage to send them as far as Mr Dolbels, he could forward them. I trust you will mark <hi rend="italic">well</hi> the <hi rend="italic">spot</hi> where you found them, for further investigation hereafter if necessary.</p>
         <p>The chq came alright. Two days ago I received a telegram from Mr Gore the Secretary to the N.Z.I. Wellington informing me, that the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> lot of Vols (XI) for us were ready &amp; would be sent on by first chance (about Wednesday next I suppose)—and I hope to be able to send you your copy by <hi rend="italic">next weeks</hi> mail, but this at present is only a <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>; as I do not know how many Vols he may send me,—and it is always a bother (with me, at least) to cut up a fowl for 14 people; hungry ones too!!.</p>
         <p>The papers (local) of this week will however give you some little reading—Mr Kinross’s return (which I am so glad of), Mr Ormonds speech, &amp; the Taradale ploughing match &amp; dinner of yesterday. (It is a good thing it was not to have come off <hi rend="italic">today</hi>, for it has been blowing &amp; raining all day). I do not agree in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Mr Ormond has said, by far the better (longer, &amp;c,) version of his speech is in the “D. Telegraph”,—if you take in that paper.</p>
         <p>We have had some fine days of late; Wednesday was a glorious day—indeed too fine to last—but I notice a very heavy coating of snow on Ruahine &amp; the lower hills, so that I fancy you have had your share.</p>
         <p>Two days ago I had the pleasure of looking over a lot of dried ferns brought by Mr Tiffin from Japan, some also from China; there are several curious ones among the lot, but I prefer for beauty our N.Z. ones. I hope when you next come to town you will pay me a visit—if only a short one—as I wish to shew you a few things; and you must not fail to look in at <hi rend="italic">your</hi> library in the Athenæum if only to see a few of the Bivos &amp;c, of the <hi rend="italic">Old</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Country.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>And now with kind remembrances to Mrs Balfour, and hoping this may find you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> well, I am</p>
         <p>     Yours very truly</p>
         <p>             W.Colenso</p>
