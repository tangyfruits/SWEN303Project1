         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I was much pleased last night, to see once more your hand writing,—I thank you for your letter, written, too, in the midst of your very busy time—or times; and am glad to find that you are able, some­how, to note, &amp; bring home, several plants, in your travelling, with an eye to the future.</p>
         <p>I have been very busy all the day (unusually so, I may say), with my many specimens from “Bush” of last 6–8 months, not however including <hi rend="italic">Mosses</hi>, Hepaticæ, &amp;c, which are separate, &amp; yet to come, or to be attended to. I have <hi rend="italic">by me</hi>, more work than I can possibly get through this winter, &amp; yet, I purpose going again to the “Bush” next week, &amp; this is the rea­son of my now writing to you, being desirous of receiveing a reply from you <hi rend="italic">before I leave</hi>—if convenient to you. You see, I am obliged to keep a <hi rend="italic">good look</hi> out, a long way ahead, on account of your <hi rend="italic">Weekly</hi> mail. You have raised my curiosity respecting your <hi rend="italic">new</hi> “<hi rend="italic">find</hi>”—a plant about a foot high, “with a <hi rend="italic">lattice beacon</hi> on the top of the stem”; You also say you have <hi rend="italic">2</hi>, &amp; kindly offer me one. &amp; so I am writing asking you to let me have it, say, by Thursday mail <hi rend="italic">next</hi> week; (I hope to leave early Fri­day morning). I leave it to you to pack, &amp;c, I have a <hi rend="italic">fancy</hi>, that it is similar to one I found last month, but I was too late for it, flowers were all withered, and it appeared as though it had been trodden on by a cow, or something, when young.</p>
         <p>You think that yours had a <hi rend="italic">bulbous</hi> root; I hope you have marked the <hi rend="italic">spot</hi>, so as to know it again, &amp;c, &amp;c.<note xml:id="ftn3-230" place="foot" n="230"> Pterostylis patens Col.</note>
         </p>
         <p>As to our poor dear Scty, (as far as I know) things are as they were!!. I was down in town on Monday, but I could learn <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. I may go out (town) tomorrow, or on Friday, when I hope to hear something good, but almost fear not. I could <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> you a good deal if you were here.</p>
         <p>If I should get your plant on Thursday week (13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>), I will try hard to write you <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I <hi rend="italic">leave</hi>; at <hi rend="italic">present</hi> I cannot say how long I shall be away.</p>
         <p>I am pretty well again. Am glad to hear of all being well at Glenross; may this find you all so,—and happy!, and with kind regards</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly </p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
         <p>Mr Balfour</p>
         <p>Put up your little <hi rend="italic">Hepatica in a bigger box</hi>, and with lots of Moss (of various sorts, if handy) so as to keep them fresh &amp; free from bruises</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
