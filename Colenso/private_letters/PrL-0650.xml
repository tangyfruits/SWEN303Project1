         <p rend="end">Napier, Friday nt.,<lb/>Septr. 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1887.</p>
         <p>A. Luff Esq.,</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Many thanks to you for this fresh proof of kindness, and readiness too:—I duly received your very kind &amp; <hi rend="italic">valued</hi> note of the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. inst., also the 2 papers (E. Post) you procured me: and I should have written before now only this being S.F. Mail wk. (&amp; several unlooked for interruptions) caused me to postpone doing so until I should have finished and dispatched my letters, papers &amp;c and this I have just done. It is different now with us to what it used to be when you were here—we have to close &amp; post on Fridays (it is true the P.O. is <hi rend="italic">open</hi> to <hi rend="italic">common</hi> letters &amp;c. until 6 <hi rend="italic">a.m.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Saturdays</hi>, but that is much the same as if it were Friday night <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>.) Another difference (which you would <hi rend="italic">not like</hi> if here &amp; in business) is, that the country mails arrive <hi rend="italic">late</hi>, and so the <hi rend="italic">priv</hi>. boxes are open, &amp;c. until 10 p.m., but another evil is, that all <hi rend="italic">town</hi> letters posted <hi rend="italic">after 5 p.m.</hi> are not sorted &amp; placed in p.b. <hi rend="italic">until</hi>, say, <hi rend="italic">10 p.m</hi>.—that is, these &amp; those by <hi rend="italic">late</hi> train are sorted together.</p>
         <p>There is much in your kind &amp; friendly note that I go with you in; especially your remark on taxes &amp;c—enough to drive one to t’other end of the globe! &amp; I fear w. <hi rend="italic">more</hi> burdens yet to come.—</p>
         <p>I felt annoyed in reading in your note that you had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> received the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">2</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> vols</hi>. of “Trans.”, so in my going to town yesterday I was determined to find it out, but Bowerman was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> down (being again unwell—often so of late,) then I sought Hamilton who seemed to have heard of it—that is, of <hi rend="italic">your note</hi> to B.—H. said, that vol. xix. had <hi rend="italic">lately</hi> been sent you: &amp; that he was pretty sure, that vol. xviii. of last year was duly forwarded, but must see B. first: I will be at them again next week. I see our meeting, on My. nt. next, only <hi rend="italic">just</hi> announced in “D.T.”</p>
         <p>I have sent you 2, 3 papers during this week—in 1, the speech of your old friend Capt. Russell, as I knew you would be interested in reading that: in another, Ormond’s:—not but you would be sure to see a good report of same, immy., in Wgn. papers, done &amp; sent by our good friend Morrison—still, it would not be in its entirety. The said speech &amp; Questions (!) occupied nearly 3 hours: far <hi rend="italic">too long</hi>: and I in the worst of the draft! which nearly extingd. Chm’s. candles. It was a trying time to me, &amp; <hi rend="italic">I feared the worst</hi>, (being hemmed in I could not well get out,) but am keeping pretty well.—</p>
         <p>If I go to Dannevirke in Oct. I will let you know, or better write to you thence, as I should stay 2–3 wks. Glad to hear of your son Henry practising &amp; <hi rend="italic">wish him heartily every success</hi>; please remember. me most kindly to him.</p>
         <p>With kindest regards, I am,</p>
         <p>My dr. sir,</p>
         <p>Yours truly, </p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. You will see my letter &amp; advt. <hi rend="italic">re </hi>this place. Some one has written in “Herald” of this mg. <hi rend="italic">strongly</hi>—coarsely—grounding on Sealy’s doings, I suppose: our road, as projected in 1881, was to be 40 ft. wide.</p>
         <p>P.S. 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Desmond was out last night at Hastings rampant! If you wish to see his speech it is in “Evg. News” of this evening and there <hi rend="italic">only</hi>: of course D. is dead set against <hi rend="italic">Capt. R.</hi>
