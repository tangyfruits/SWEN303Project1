         <p rend="end">Friday evening Aug 8/79</p>
         <p>Mr Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>For some time past have been going to write to you, have always been hindered,—to make sure this week have kept a memo on my writing table bearing your name, &amp; now I am come to the last evening, as your <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> mail leaves tomorrow, &amp; therefore I must write, but, to tell you the truth, I have little heart to do so, for I have spent the whole former part of the day in the Court (from before 10 o’clock) against excessive over valuation, &amp; I returned this afternoon both tired &amp; cross,—as, in spite of all I could say or bring forward, I lost my case &amp; had all my labour for nothing. But I could see it was a foregone matter,—having so many Gov. officials against me, too; I noticed Mr Kinross there in waiting, so I suppose he also is an objector, with many others of the town &amp; neighbourhood. May they speed better than I have done.</p>
         <p>If <hi rend="italic">your</hi> mail left us every day—or, say, 3 times a week, I would not write now. But enough of that,—everyman kens best whaur his ain shoe binds him.</p>
         <p>I wished to write to you to tell you about your lot of stones. The day or so after you were last here I had a look at them; and they set me to thinking pretty much. I saw they were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> birds gizzard stones (as like those of the Moa), then what were they. I felt pretty sure they had been collected by man for some purpose; &amp; had been dropped, or left (possibly in a kit) where you had found them; well I could not sleep that night thinking over them, when suddenly the thought came into my head—those stones were collected by the Maoris of old to form sinkers for their long fishing nets; each one would have a bit of rough netting of flax put closely around it &amp; then separately bound on firmly on the lower side, or edge, of the net, as I have often seen them. I was all but cer­tain I was right, &amp; since then I took some with me to town &amp; shewed to some of our old Maoris, who recognised them at once, &amp; said I was quite right. No doubt in the <hi rend="italic">river</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> near where you found them, such stones are to be found.</p>
         <p>Further, if you found them on ground which may have been an old Maori <hi rend="italic">Pa</hi>, you may also find some old stone axes &amp; other things, thereabouts. I merely mention this to you, it may be worth while to look about thereaway.</p>
         <p>Mr Millar (Railway Manager) was here this afternoon to show me a fine specimen of a sharks tooth, <hi rend="italic">wholly perfect</hi>, they had dug out of the stone at the cliff whence they are getting the stuff for the filling in below; it was 3/4 inch each way, &amp; formed nearly an equilateral triangle, &amp; was beautifully serrated on both edges</p>
         <p>The remainder of our copies of “Transactions” are just arrived, &amp; now I shall get <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">copy</hi>; I had, at last, written about them to Wgn, for I was getting tired, so many enquiries too, from those who had not been helped from the first dist.—who had also become more hungry &amp; impatient through waiting; I hope you have found something to interest you in your copy. I regret my 2 Ruahine papers (mentioned in the Vol. under H.B. “Proceedings”—at the end) were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> printed.</p>
         <p>There is plenty of snow on Ruahine now, &amp; I dare say you too, have had your full share since your return. The last 2 days however have been very fine. Our winter is drawing to an end, &amp; I suppose your lambing season is near.</p>
         <p>I fancy that some of our papers, news, &amp; statements of late may have interested you—especially Buchanan &amp; Cos Railway.</p>
         <p>Well, goodbye, and with kind regards to Mrs Balfour, and best wishes, </p>
         <p>     Believe me,</p>
         <p>             Yours truly</p>
         <p>                     W.Colenso</p>
         <p>P.S. Will send you some English papers next week. <lb/>W. C.</p>
