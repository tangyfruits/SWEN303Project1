         <p rend="end">Napier, June 5, 1879.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Two days back I received your kind note of May 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. (rather long in coming!) and would have replied by the steamer leaving hence for Auckland yesterday,—but I was much too busy.</p>
         <p>With your note came specimens of your 2 New Ferns,—<hi rend="italic">Hymenoph. Ch.</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Polypodm. N.Z.</hi>,—for <hi rend="italic">these </hi>I must particularly thank you (in addition to thanks for your Note). I had, of course, heard, and read, too, of your new <hi rend="italic">Polypodm.</hi>, and (to tell you the truth) I had feared it might turn out to be a “sport” (?) of <hi rend="italic">Polym. Billardi.</hi>, such as I had found on the dry ranges in the interior some 30 years ago: but I now believe it is <hi rend="italic">altogether </hi>different.</p>
         <p>Unfortunately I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> send you <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">decent</hi> specimens of <hi rend="italic">Cyath. Polym</hi>., but I hope to be able to do so by &amp; bye: and I should tell you the reason why.—</p>
         <p>I have the plant growing in my garden where it has been this last 10–12 years, (the trunk being 6 ft. high,)—and it was owing to <hi rend="italic">this</hi> that I did not secure fruiting specimens last year (i.e. 1877–78) believing, I could always do so!—then the long horrid drought came and nearly killed it! I gave a man 5/- a week throughout the summer to bring me every evening 2 buckets of good water from below, and I generally watered it myself: all its big fronds dwindled withered and died! It is now however shooting afresh &amp; vigorously. It is a fine species. I even could not send Dr. Hector specimens, when I sent him the Paper.</p>
         <p>I have seen several plants (alt. 5–6 feet) on the lower slopes of the Ruahine ranges, but none in fruit, yet grandly beautiful! To recline (as I have) under one of them , &amp; to look up skywards through its ample spreading translucent fronds is a magnificent sight, and one not likely to be soon forgotten! I have said “translucent,” this is owing to its <hi rend="italic">many veins</hi>, which allow of a fine tracery of light.—</p>
         <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Hymenophm. </hi>I have some spns. securely put away <hi rend="italic">in bundles </hi>with other plants, but <hi rend="italic">not handy</hi>: indeed, I have nothing handy <hi rend="italic">at present. </hi>But I have long been collecting Ferns from other countries, and many Books on the Family, and hope and intend (shortly (?) or in the coming spring) to go over my lot, and put them in order, and then <hi rend="italic">I will be sure to remember you.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Now to your Books, which you offer, (which, also, cause me to write to you at once, as, you say, “You wish for an early answer.”) I fear, I must say,—We don’t require them. (1) Because—as you may see in our little Reports (1877–1878), we have several of such works, and <hi rend="italic">larger</hi>,—as, for instance, vols. 1–4, 29–30, 36–38. (2) Because the Work itself is scarcely such an one as is fitted for modern scientific <hi rend="italic">reference</hi>,—though very good for reading,—and, I think, an admirable one for a family in the country, or for a Village Library. Curiously enough when last at Auckland I purchased some odd volumes of it at a Booksellers.—</p>
         <p>I have H. &amp; Bogue’s Cat., and had last year noticed the work. As you say, <hi rend="italic">it is cheap at £8.—</hi>And you ought to be able to find a buyer for it, easily, near you. I would myself give £5. for it, to <hi rend="italic">give </hi>away—as Reward Books,—but I don’t need it myself.</p>
         <p>Have you any Botanical friend, or correspondent, <hi rend="italic">N. </hi>of Bay Islands, and on E. Coast? I have long been desirous of getting roots or seeds of <hi rend="italic">Colensoa</hi>,<note xml:id="ftn3-10" place="foot" n="10"> WC: I do not suppose any of your Auckland Gardeners to have it in stock?—seeds <hi rend="italic">preferred </hi>in Capsules.</note> &amp; would pay a fair price for such: as far as I know it only grows away in those localities.—</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well.</p>
         <p>Believe me, Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
