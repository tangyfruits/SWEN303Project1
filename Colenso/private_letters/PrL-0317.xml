         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand<lb/>March 9<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. 1876.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>My last—long—letter to you was dated Feby. 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> (<hi rend="italic">concluding</hi> part)—I hope it will safely reach you in due course.<note xml:id="ftn2-261" place="foot" n="261"> The preceding surviving letter is 9–11 January 1876.</note> Our S.F. Mail is to be made up tomorrow, so I must write. By <hi rend="italic">Herald </hi>this evg. we have London news to 7<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. (per <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Cable!!) which informs us of Wool being rather low—&amp; of the S.F. Mail having been delivered at London on 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—that is (I suppose) <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Jany. one to you.—</p>
         <p>Since my last to you I have recd. 2 letters from you—<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. Decr. 15 and Jany. 2 which have interested me greatly—as I was anxious to know how <hi rend="underline italic">you</hi> would stand the Eng. Winter, which this season appears to be extra severe. I saw Gollan last week who declares the <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> drove <hi rend="italic">him </hi>out of Engd; he <hi rend="italic">arrived well</hi> (like Rhodes) but (like him too) has been laid up a bit through (the Drs. say) the change of returning to N.Z. but this I <hi rend="italic">cannot </hi>understand. G. is still in town!</p>
         <p>First, let me tell you, that I have recd. by this last Eng. Mail, a letter and a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> packet, both from London, addressed to a “<hi rend="italic">Mrs E. </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">More</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">house, c/o A. Luff Esq”—</hi>at <hi rend="italic">first</hi> I thought of sending them on to Canterbury, but on seeing the difference in <hi rend="italic">spelling</hi> the name, I have not done so—what shall I do with them?</p>
         <p>Second, Bank Ex. in October last (&amp; indeed from July) was “60 days, 1%—30 days, 1½%—sight, 2%”—&amp; Brandon tells me, all the Banks in N.Z. were alike.</p>
         <p>Third, in a P. Gazette pubd. some time back, I noticed, in list of Cr. Grants, one for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Oeroland </hi>(I think); I set the Gaz. on one side to send to you, &amp; now I cannot find it!</p>
         <p>Fourth, I have <hi rend="italic">this mg</hi>. got from Scally from “Roy’s hill”—£1.12.0—for 16 Puriri posts I let him have to finish his job of fencing: I enclose a <hi rend="italic">sketch</hi> of <hi rend="italic">the chasm</hi>, &amp;c, by which you may know my <hi rend="italic">present</hi> loss &amp; injury there:—and now Weber has bought the adjoining Section purposely to remove the soil into a Sn. just opposite in the water, which he also had purchased,—of course his own <hi rend="italic">private</hi>. He told me he should take all care, &amp; if he should be the unfort. cause of any damage, he would pay— “up to £<hi rend="italic">50</hi>.” Bless the man! I would not take £100. as equivalent to what has <hi rend="italic">already</hi> been done!! By a Parly. Paper I find, Johnston (Wgn.) has been paid £700., <hi rend="italic">Weber’s award</hi>, for his 3 Sections in Swamp—between Railway &amp; Munro Street! I twitted W. about this,—as he has told me that he would never allow (award) me a 1d. for the damage done me, &amp; for the earth taken for the Railway.—W. retorted, he had awarded (<hi rend="italic">obliged to</hi>) the Gas Co. £100. for the ¼ ac. the Railway had taken: had it been all mine I question if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should have got it. I was at Waipawa last week, and I find the Road Board has <hi rend="italic">ruined</hi> my Section <hi rend="italic">on the hill</hi> (above Bibby’s &amp; Grant’s) which you purchased. I was astonished! They have cut rather <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the boundary of my sections &amp; the fall is 10–12 feet perpendicular, &amp; the earth crumbly!! I went to Bibby, Rathbone (<hi rend="italic">Chairman</hi>)<hi rend="italic"> </hi>&amp;c.—they say, they wanted the earth to fill up below, &amp; that the contractor did cut too deep, &amp; that B. seeing this stopped him:—and, that there was <hi rend="italic">no redress</hi> against the Public Board!! The next day, the wealthy Rathbone, after some demur, paid me £<hi rend="italic">3. </hi>for the £4<hi rend="italic">. I had paid Parker</hi> 12 months ago, for R’s. share of dwg. fence,—saying—“It was badly put up”!!—I felt <hi rend="italic">ashamed</hi> of R. “He asked if the £3. would satisfy me?” I said “Anything for a settlement &amp; quietness: If he felt satisfied in offg. me £3. for what he knew I had paid £4., relying on his word that he wod. pay—then I wod. be so.” – – – MacKay, I fear I shall have trouble with, poor fellow! he is a great loser through the Jany. flood. J. Dolbel—who assured me, last yr, If I wod. wait till Feby. he cod. do something, is still putting off! He says, his wool by “<hi rend="italic">Cel. Queen</hi>”—9 Bales sold at 7d.!! &amp; 15 were withdrawn, &amp; such don’t pay expenses! I enclose a sketch tracing of retaining wall now putting up in Milton Road, on Wilkinson’s old Sn. The Contract was taken (through Peppercorne) for near ₤60.—120 feet:—my man soon saw that they intended to feather the work!—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">this height </hi>to <hi rend="italic">start</hi> from at lower end, &amp; to run it away to nothing at upper!! On my return from inland I saw Contractor: “Yes, it was to be so”!! We went to P.,—had a long talk! &amp; I believe the Contractor was right—though, <hi rend="italic">I am again </hi>the sufferer!—he shewed it by his tender, so much the whole job, or so much per cubic yd. (25/-)—at which price is about <hi rend="underline italic">½</hi> of the whole! I had allotted ₤50. (in mind; &amp; had told P. this,) &amp; now it will cost nearer ₤100! I believe, I shall have the <hi rend="italic">lower </hi>section also walled in (lightly &amp; roughly) &amp; then level away mound &amp; fill up &amp; in.—One or two houses going up in town, but several are empty —as Berry’s (3) Noble’s (2).</p>
         <p>The other day the “Inverness” sailed for Engd. with her load of wool &amp; <hi rend="italic">several</hi> passengers—among whom are Price of Motuotaraia &amp; his wife—going home for <hi rend="italic">her benefit</hi>, to see if Doctors can cure her. A small Schooner was on shore last week, just where the Steamer was, but she was got off. See this day’s <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> which I send you with some others. R.Price actually <hi rend="italic">took </hi>my <hi rend="italic">part </hi>in <hi rend="italic">2</hi> articles <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Mao. Lexicon!!! I send you Copies. Drower has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet pd. for saddlery—3 Dishond. Bills!! And now I am <hi rend="italic">waiting on him</hi>.—More Bankrupts since last—Plante, Mrs Welch, (whose husband died lately at Wairarapa,) Wright—a painter, &amp;c, who had the <hi rend="italic">new </hi>shop next to your old office, and others from inland.—</p>
         <p>This mg. Mr Grubb, seeing my man in town, sent word— “he wod. not be able to write to you by this Mail being <hi rend="italic">so busy</hi>.” The <hi rend="italic">new </hi>P.O. knocks them all up! the letters, for instance, are now delivered <hi rend="italic">within</hi> in a large room, &amp; the one who had to attend to that work, went off from the other business. The Inspr. of P.O. has been here, &amp; spent a few days w. Grubb, but he does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> see that G. needs extra help,—&amp; they nearly had words: he is a <hi rend="italic">young</hi> m. lately from Engld. but was trained to P.O. work there. I shall be <hi rend="italic">very sorry</hi> if G. should leave, (he is now going to have a short furlough,) for I like him much—&amp; he has done not a little towards supplying <hi rend="italic">the hollow vacancy left by yourself.</hi> I enclose in one of the Papers a Circular of the H.B. Phil. Institute: tell me if <hi rend="italic">you remain a Member</hi>. Mr Smalley—through dint of hard striving—has sought <hi rend="italic">me </hi>to assist at their annual Demonstration next week,—J. Rh. in Chair. A big house is building on Harding’s flat for his son Rechab, who is to marry M. Miller’s daughter,—Miller, too, having become a Rechabite!—(and I believe Joe is going to have one at the new station—“Forest Gate”.) H.R.R. takes on himself to make all the Ministers who use the School Room at Waipukau. to pay for it, and now Lyndon (for Ch. Trustees) is suing H.R.R. for Parsonage!!!. Mr Hamlin died just as the last Mail left. Mr Tylee is got round again, &amp; just at office. He shewed me a Book of <hi rend="italic">photographs </hi>bound at Dinwiddie’s,—of fearfully lowering pen &amp; ink scratches of many of us, (much like <hi rend="italic">those</hi> of Tiffen—but it is <hi rend="italic">doubtful </hi>if T. is the author,)—there is myself (often), Justice Johnston, McLean, Lee, Lambert, &amp; several others. Tylee expressed surprise at my not having before seen it,—and other <hi rend="italic">phots. also. </hi>The train runs now to Te Aute (i.e. this side of the Hotel, ½ a mile)—I don’t like it—as it makes me <hi rend="italic">sickish</hi>! (Willie, in his Dec. letter, speaks of having written to you, but at that time, had recd. <hi rend="italic">no</hi> answer. Do him all the good you can—for my sake: he is dwelling <hi rend="italic">very quietly</hi> with my Brother &amp; his <hi rend="italic">large </hi>family.—</p>
         <p>I am pretty well—but <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">very careful</hi>. Have to commence travelling next week, but <hi rend="italic">don’t like </hi>it. The weather is <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>: Waite, schoolmaster at Waipawa, married Wheeler’s daughter (called, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, Tatham)—she was at H.R.R’s. </p>
         <p>The Xmas no. of the <hi rend="italic">Graphic </hi>you mention did <hi rend="italic">not </hi>arrive. So also the no. sent by my son—I suppose owing to their being of extra size! Thanks for the bottle of <hi rend="italic">Neuraline </hi>per Hudson; I have it <hi rend="italic">all right</hi>—I may soon require it, &amp; in using it, shall think on <hi rend="italic">you</hi> more than ever.</p>
         <p>And now my Dear Sir with very kind regards to all your family,—I am, Yours ever,</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
