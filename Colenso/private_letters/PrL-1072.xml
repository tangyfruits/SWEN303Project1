         <p>Dear Mrs. Prebble</p>
         <p>Being very busy to day I was not able to get down to town, and I forgot to speak to my man in time.—–</p>
         <p>If you have any <hi rend="italic">good fresh</hi> strawberries left, I will thank you to give him a box for me. Those, a few days ago, were much praised by the Ladies on the hill.—</p>
         <p>I hope you are well,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
