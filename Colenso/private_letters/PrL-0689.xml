         <p rend="end">NAPIER OCT 17/88</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours of the 13th to hand, and I thank you for it.—at same time sorry you were greatly disappointed—the second time too. I am just able to sit up, and write a few lines.</p>
         <p>I went to meeting on 15th—<hi rend="italic">obliged</hi>—&amp; in pain, (going in trap to &amp; fro, from bottom of hill, &amp; helped up on return by a strong man). I suffered <hi rend="italic">much</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">there.</hi> The only fair report is in <hi rend="italic">Evg News</hi>. It was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> postponed (on 8th) on my <hi rend="italic">account</hi> (as you say), but owing to H <hi rend="italic">not</hi> advertising it. <hi rend="italic">And</hi> the bad weather—my being laid up with <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> Rheumatism happened at same time, &amp; kept me (and my papers) away.—Had I been well I should now be in the Bush, whither I hope to go early next week. Am very sorry to find P.D. laid up with same complaint.—I write with difficulty, and cannot write any more now.</p>
         <p>Kind regards and best wishes</p>
         <p>Yours truly </p>
         <p>W. Colenso</p>
