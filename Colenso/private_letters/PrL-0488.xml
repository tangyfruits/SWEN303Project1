         <p rend="end">Napier, March 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 1882</p>
         <p>Mr J. Drummond</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>You have been very much in my thoughts of late—possibly too much so,—I had promised to write to you this week (which I ought to have done on Sunday last, so that you might get it <hi rend="italic">today</hi>, but I could not)—now however, that it is a downright day of rain, &amp; the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of a new month, I, confined within doors, turn to my unanswered &amp; ever-growing bun­dle of letters, &amp; pull out yours of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Feby, to reply. And first, I thank you for it, &amp; I am pleased to hear that you liked my Maori Essay (or Essay on the Maoris); it ought to have been enlarged, &amp;, above all, my valuable <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, sent with it to Dunedin, should have been published with it.</p>
         <p>I suppose you duly received a copy of our Annual Report I sent you. I have just put up a spare one for Miss L. Smith (your neighbour), asking her to join, &amp; telling her that she can see a copy of the big Yearly Book (Vol XIII) with you,—and supposed you would lend it to her.</p>
         <p>Now, as to your remarks about your <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Spiders dying directly in “Spirits” <hi rend="smallcaps">and the </hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps italic">former</hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps"> </hi>ones struggling ½ hour more; I think my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> were in Whis­key (not over strong, &amp; well watered!!) &amp; this may make or mark the differ­ence.—The old Mao Club found in the swamp I should like to see, but keep it.,(with all other similar things,) until <hi rend="italic">I call,</hi> this Autumn.</p>
         <p>I shall have much pleasure in supporting your nomination “Mr Innis G. Mackfarlane”, at our next Council Meeting (shortly)—is his name with the K (as you have it) or without? &amp; what is G—George?.</p>
         <p>In your last you neither mentioned the boy nor his mother, but, as no news is <hi rend="italic">good</hi> news, I hope that both are well.­</p>
         <p>I have been writing<hi rend="sup"> </hi>all this day, answering letters,—nearly all on Scientific Subjects. Balfour of Glenross, (I daresay you know him) has again sent me a nice lot of living &amp; dead subjects; the living ones ­large insects, (in water here with me) have given me some research, &amp;c, but I have hit them at last, &amp; I believe them to be the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> state of Dragon-fly (or, Horse stinger, though they do not sting), which you sent me, but I will know more about them yet. B has also sent me some (old) Bones &amp; teeth of an <hi rend="italic">animal</hi> (Quadruped), <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> the remains packed into a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> match box (tin perforated)!! &amp; yet may prove to be of value to Science. I have studied these fragments “pretty considerably”, &amp; I shall return to them again.—Winklemann has also sent me some specimens, fossil &amp; botanical, gained during his Xmas holiday excursion.</p>
         <p>I <hi rend="italic">have wished</hi> that I knew where, in <hi rend="italic">Waipawa</hi>, I could send a small box of peaches for you &amp; yours; had I known of <hi rend="italic">your sure</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> man <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, I should have done so; when you next write, just let me now to whom there I could leave a parcel for you, it is handy to know this. I do not take in the “W. Mail” this year, but I saw in the “D.T.” that you were a winner at some of the races at Hampden. The big Pakowhai Races <hi rend="italic">today</hi> are nowhere; put off ow­ing to the rain, till tomorrow. For my part, while I do not altogether disapprove of quiet Country Races, trials of skill &amp; strength between Residents <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> owners of horses,—<hi rend="italic">I do dislike</hi> the common low debasing Races of H.B. with <hi rend="italic">all their</hi> comitants of lying, dishonesty, betting, &amp; cheating; Ind­eed, I have long considered them to be a <hi rend="italic">greater curse to N.Z. &amp; the young and rising generation,</hi> than <hi rend="italic">either</hi> Tobacco smoking, or Drinking;—a wretched lot of travelling Swindlers (who never knew an honest days work) are <hi rend="italic">thus encouraged; these do immense mischief among many of our young men.</hi> I would that races were either abandoned, or suppressed.—</p>
         <p>­I have never forgotten your <hi rend="italic">very important</hi> question put to me in a former letter—about Jesus &amp; the Trinity; &amp; which I had promised to answer. I could <hi rend="smallcaps">do so in </hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps italic">writing</hi>
            <hi rend="smallcaps"> </hi>to any seeker after <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> (like yourself) but to do so in <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> would take up so much time; when we meet we may talk about it. I have a plan in my head <hi rend="italic">to tell you.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>With this I shall send 2 papers, both lately to hand; the one from my son contains a <hi rend="italic">good </hi>bit, bearing on this subject (marked); the one from Dunedin (to hand last night) also contains much that way, and <hi rend="italic">beyond.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I send this one as you may not have seen it. And now, with kind regards to <hi rend="italic">you all</hi> 3, and best wishes,</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
