         <p rend="end">NAPIER<lb/>Aug 20/85</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour </p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yours of the 16th to hand yesterday; good, and wel­come, as ever. I should not write to you now were it not that I have put up a box of Moa bones, &amp;c, for Dr Haast, X ch, (merely to be exd &amp; returned) and I thought your recent fossil “find” (Tarsa, Tibia, &amp;c) had better go with them—<hi rend="italic">to be returned.</hi> As there may be sufficient to indicate the genus—if not the species, from comparison with their <hi rend="italic">numerous</hi> lots. So send them to me early, say by this day week at the latest; my box would be sent Sat­urday next, but I delay it for yours.</p>
         <p>I am glad <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are well. I wish<hi rend="italic">I</hi> were also. Just now, and from Sat 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> I am very so so. I fear I have a boil (or something worse) coming slow­ly under my seat, close in to crease of thigh, &amp; I cannot <hi rend="italic">sit</hi>, save a few min at a time, &amp; then in <hi rend="italic">great</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">pain</hi>. I fear too, it is of the kind called <hi rend="italic">Car­buncle</hi> (of which I have had several in former years, the last about 35 years ago). I assure you my life has been miserable of late; so much to be done, and cannot get about it!! I potter about on my legs to fill up the day, &amp; then at night, no sleep, or but little or broken.­—</p>
         <p>Just too months since I was attacked with Lumbago, &amp; scarcely a sound <hi rend="italic">whole day</hi> since.—I am pretty free from Rheumatism—&amp; in other respects well—but this last visitant—upsets me—but enough of this.­—</p>
         <p>Your Maori sentence may be easy enough—but in all cases the Maori an­swer will <hi rend="italic">depend on the</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">question</hi>, &amp; that in every particular. I would like to know <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> what your friend (F) said. Did <hi rend="italic">he speak correctly</hi>?. What you give as reply—is a strange one for a Maori—quite <hi rend="italic">unnatural</hi>-like, I should say; I fancy “F” said something more, or <hi rend="italic">pronounced</hi> the words <hi rend="italic">wrongly</hi> so as to mean (to the M) something else.—I never before heard of such a reply to such a question. However I will give you the phrase “I am not God,” in Maori:—strictly thus “Ehara au i to Atua”.<note xml:id="ftn3-318" place="foot" n="318"> WC: Ay harra ow ee tay Atooah.</note>
            <hi rend="italic">This</hi> would fit better the word “Arra”, meaning “<hi rend="italic">I don’t know</hi>”,—and so qualifying the remaining words. Or he <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have replied,—“Aua” he Atua koia au, or Aua;<note xml:id="ftn3-319" place="foot" n="319"> WC: as, in <hi rend="italic">Bower Powder</hi>, meaning “I don’t know” “am I indeed a God that I should know”.</note> he atua ranei au” which would be <hi rend="italic">better still.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I write w difficulty. I enclose one of my circulars <hi rend="italic">re</hi> M. Lex; my time is being sadly wasted!.</p>
         <p>             With kind regards</p>
         <p>                             Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
