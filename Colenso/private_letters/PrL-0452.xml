         <p>My dear Professor Von Haast,</p>
         <p>Last week I received a single copy of vol. viii. “Trans. N.Z. Inst.,” from the Secretary N.Z.I., for our Inst. Library; and I have been thinking that probably you have been favoured with a copy,—and therefore I write a line.</p>
         <p>If so, as I have supposed above,—I trust <hi rend="italic">you will have seen therein</hi> what I had intimated to you in my note of last year,—viz. that I had yet much more to say <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the great antiquity of the Maori race here in N.Z. And I have yet more to say thereon,—all tending that way. And I hope to add thereto during this winter’s session.</p>
         <p>I have recently heard of Dr. Hector having returned from Melbourne: you, too, may have been absent there,—indeed, I have not heard anything of you, or from you, for a long time. I hope you are quite well.—</p>
         <p>I have not yet gone through vol. xiii.—indeed, scarcely looked into it, as Dr. Spencer &amp; others wished to see it—our <hi rend="italic">only</hi> (hitherto) copy.</p>
         <p>Shall always be glad to be favoured with a line from you, whenever you have the time to write,</p>
         <p>And am, my dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
