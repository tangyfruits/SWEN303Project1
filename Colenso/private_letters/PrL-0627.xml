         <p rend="end">Napier, July 6/86</p>
         <p>T. Morrison, Esq.</p>
         <p>Occidental Hotel Wgn.</p>
         <p>My Dr Sir</p>
         <p>I got yr address last wk. from Mr. P. Dinwiddie &amp; now I am going to trouble you with a little matter (in <hi rend="italic">our</hi> line) belg. I shall have your hearty help—if you can spare the time.—</p>
         <p>Of course you know of the spn. sht. of the Mao. Lexn. wh. Mr B laid on the Table. I hope you have also <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> it. Now I have been cruelly served in that business from first to last. Five years ago I copied at Sir W.B’s request, some 30–40 pages Ms. But they of the last Govt <hi rend="italic">[****] </hi>werenever ptd. Last yr. Mr O moved that they shod be ptd &amp; Mr B promd. as much. This yr that mis. wretched sheet (contg. at most only one p. of the Lexn.) is produced!!—well I have been trying hard ever since to get more done—if only, say, 4 pages more,—but I cannot succeed, not even w. my offer to pay Mr. D. his charges for doing so; as, they say, he is too busy.—</p>
         <p>Such then being the state of things, I have thought of asking you, to see L.&amp;B. &amp; to ask 1. if they can print me at once (say) 4–12 pages—much as p.4 of that sheet, &amp; to have cord. proof sent to me here. 2. What their charge would be per page for say 250 copies &amp; what 500 copies—in sheets.</p>
         <p>Then I shall want to know if Mr B (or the Nat. Office) will allow of those Ms. pages being passed on to L.&amp;B. as “copy”,—to be kept clean &amp; returned to Mr. B.—Perhaps L.&amp;B. could ask this (of Didsbury or some one). But I will also write to Capt.R. to make the enquiry for me.—I much wish to get a fair sample of the said work printed right off—now that a beg. has been made.</p>
         <p>My only reason for employing L.&amp;B. is, that I don’t suppose Mr. B. would allow the said Ms. to be retd. to me; if he wod. then it cod. be ptd. <hi rend="italic">here</hi> which I shod. greatly prefer.</p>
         <p>I enclose a Parly. P. of ’75, which you may not have seen, it will tell you much about the Lexn.—</p>
         <p>The Spl. Corrt. (whoever he is) of the Wkly News has told a gross error concg. me &amp; the Lexn.—it is in the WN of June 26, p.16. I have just written to the Edr. abt. it.</p>
         <p>If you are not too busy let me have a few lines from you: I hope you are q. well.</p>
         <p>&amp; am yrs truly<lb/>  WC.</p>
         <p>Send Tels. I will pay. Have you seen vol xiv Trans. I have a large share therein.</p>
