         <p rend="end">Napier Wednesday night Sept 19/83</p>
         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have to write you a letter (which job I had set down for myself to do, on Monday afternoon last,) and for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time in my life—or during our (now) long &amp; friendly correspondence, could almost wish I had it <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to perform;—for it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be one <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Jeremiah’s of old, Lamn.—&amp; mourng.—&amp; woe. But I’ll begin.</p>
         <p>First, about your dear little son!. I was so grieved to find in our <hi rend="italic">hurried</hi> meeting last Saturday, that he, my dear little visitor, was in the doctors hands; and now I find from your letter of 17<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. (to hand late last night), that he had been <hi rend="italic">very</hi> ill;—indeed, you had almost feared the worst for him. I trust however that, like most healthy children, he is now getting rapidly well—to the joy &amp; comfort of Mrs Balfour &amp; yourself, to say nothing of his other kind relations. <hi rend="italic">Be sure you let me know</hi>. Second, your <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> case of—well, curios, not <hi rend="italic">Gold</hi>!. I had determined on Sat &amp; Sunday, that, come what may, I would break bulk and go through the whole cargo on Monday Mg. Well, I did so, directly after breakfast in my parlour (the day being wet &amp; cold). I opened &amp; partly cleaned every spn, throwing into the fire the damp rotten papers as fast as I could scrape them off; it was a job, a sickening job, for the mould had dried, &amp; hence flew about in clouds of nasty sickening dust, smelling awfully bad! it nearly knocked me up!!. It seemed worse than the unrolling the bandages from an Egyptian Mummy. Fortunately the stones &amp; bones are not injured, and not a few of the lot are of service in the Museum as <hi rend="italic">Good</hi> spns, and, all being well,will be <hi rend="italic">displayed</hi> at our next ord. meeting in Oct.</p>
         <p>Two questions I must put, anent the same,—What caused you to call a few <hi rend="italic">White</hi> pebbles, Moa Stones”? &amp; “—What is this leathery like fungus?. It is, as if of thin sheep skin, such as bookmakers use, or, as Curriers shavings; or, as if it were an old lining, or, a worn out tobacco pouch!! What is it? whence? &amp; <hi rend="italic">all about it</hi>. It got much wetted in the box, &amp; I had trouble to get the paper off it, &amp; it had dried, &amp; was horridly mouldy. I have only partly looked at it, as it was shrivelled up, &amp; half stuck together, but the thing has interested me much. I shall have some more questions, by-and-bye, to put anent your curios.</p>
         <p>Third—Last night, 8.15pm, my man came in with letters, &amp;c, from P.O, and among them</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">[Page missing]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I must hie awa’ to the woods again before long; <hi rend="italic">there</hi> I am at home; &amp; my health is first rate, although of course, there is <hi rend="italic">less</hi> of house comforts &amp;c. The day you mention as being your coldest, was also so with me; roads <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> frozen,—ice in pools, &amp; the bairnies breaking it up with glee, as I did when a child,—the frost, in the shade, remained all that day without thawing, though the sun shone <hi rend="italic">clearly</hi> all the day; Ah; I enjoyed that day in the woods;—&amp; <hi rend="italic">joined</hi> all around in giving praise &amp; worship with a thankful heart to the great and ever present Father. At such times one can understand the writers of Ps 148, &amp; the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Hymn, “O all þe works of the Lord”;—wherein he says “O ye mountains &amp; hills, O all ye green things upon earth,—bless ye the Lord, praise Him &amp; magnify Him forever”.</p>
         <p>There, far away from the busy world, and from man,—there in those ancient woods, among “The trees of the Lords planting,” &amp; communion with God,—I always return <hi rend="italic">strengthened</hi>; but I must stop this.—</p>
         <p>Your <hi rend="italic">bits</hi> of Hepaticæ I have only just looked at; always send more of each sort (when you do send) &amp; in fruit, &amp; in the rough moss as gathered. I have seen some beautiful ones in the woods &amp; glens, <hi rend="italic">dark shaded</hi> glens—but it was too early; Next month &amp; 2 following ones they will be in fruit; Keep a good lookout for your Symphogyna biflora—in fruit. My head is aching, I must close; I had no dinner today, second time this week, in order to finish my cases in time, my “parlour” being my workshop, and my table my working bench by day &amp; by night.</p>
         <p>My health on the whole is very good; a little rheumatism at times, but weather splendid. I believe the Bush air, &amp;c., agrees with me better than the sea-side.</p>
         <p>Goodbye; and with very kind regards to all, &amp; best wishes </p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. What about the <hi rend="italic">case</hi> ?. I hope you <hi rend="italic">may</hi>, somehow, get this early. W.C.</p>
         <p>P.S. After all, I think the little tin boxes as handy &amp; A.1. good as anything for those small matters by post. I purpose leaving for 70 mile bush on Wednesday next.</p>
