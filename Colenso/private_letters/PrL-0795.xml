         <p>Dear Mr. Mantell</p>
         <p>I write a line to inform you that I am this day returning by Mail that vol. of the Quarterly Review to the G.A.L., through Capt. Russell—from whom I received it.—</p>
         <p>I wired a line to you on Monday last to let you know I should do so.—</p>
         <p>I have been working very hard at my paper day &amp; night (having had to hunt up so many authorities for necessary extracts,)—and am happy in being able to tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, that I have succeeded in triumphantly clearing <hi rend="italic">your</hi> honoured Father from the malevolent &amp; lying onslaught of that Reviewer. I hope the N.Z. Institute (i.e. Sir James Hector, Director and Editor,) will by-and-by publish it. I <hi rend="italic">may </hi>have to look to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.—</p>
         <p>And I also hope, that that Reviewer may still be alive to read my <hi rend="italic">exposé</hi>.</p>
         <p>Trusting you are keeping quite well—and with very kind regards                       I am</p>
         <p>                             Yours faithy,</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. If you can—by&amp;by—answer those 2 queries in my <hi rend="italic">former</hi> note I will thank you to do so.         W.C.</p>
      </body>
