         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>April 5, 1893.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. Harding</p>
         <p>I think I must write to you tonight, although it is <hi rend="italic">before </hi>my time: for, I have yours of the 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi> (quick reply to mine of 27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. ulto.) and I thank you for it.—I would you had said <hi rend="italic">less </hi>about “Billy” Swanson, whom I never knew, &amp; don’t recollect. [just 2 pages of your note!!]—</p>
         <p>Don’t trouble yourself <hi rend="italic">re </hi>Bidwell, it is of no great consequence—only I think it will turn out that <hi rend="italic">he </hi>was the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>to travel inland (Taupo dist.) <hi rend="italic">besides </hi>his visit, or <hi rend="italic">ascent </hi>of Tongariro; by-&amp;-by will do for that.—</p>
         <p>If “Atkinson’s Critique” appears in Trans. we shall see it. In town this mg. I saw Large, Craig, &amp; Dinwiddie junior, by Bk.N.Z. tel. post, hard at it! chatting—I supposed they were plotting or hatching, and I wod. not disturb them: aftds. I saw D. in Craigs shop, and I asked him <hi rend="italic">re </hi>“Report”—he sd. that White was getting it out, &amp;c—&amp; soon to be in Printer’s hands. I have recd. from Hon. Secy. Auckld. branch, a copy of theirs—as usual, some thousands of credit! but several members struck off for <hi rend="italic">non-payt</hi>. but others elected. I note what you say <hi rend="italic">re </hi>yr. kind speaking to <hi rend="italic">Maskell</hi>—last week (Good Friday) I recd. such a lot of copy (Proofs) of several of my Botl. papers—about 30 pps. altogether well-printed, but a sad trial for my eyes in the <hi rend="italic">dull </hi>sun-<hi rend="italic">less </hi>weather of that time—to be read <hi rend="underline italic">&amp; retd. immy.</hi> to Sir J.H.; as before, <hi rend="italic">no </hi>press Copy came with them; however I read them, only a <hi rend="underline italic">few</hi> errors, &amp; in retg. wrote a <hi rend="italic">priv.</hi> note to Sir James, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>what I had written to you:—and now you tell me—<hi rend="italic">he is absent.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>You say “Jacky-tye” reptd. there by N.Z. Mail—did they also insert my notice?</p>
         <p>I have looked over—<hi rend="italic">scanned</hi>—that <hi rend="italic">long </hi>ep. in “Press” on Macaulay’s N.Zr. Surely the writer should enter a monastery—or become a R.C. Priest. If you, or any one, read it through—you have more patience than I have.</p>
         <p>You amused me consy. with your memo. re<hi rend="italic"> </hi>“<hi rend="italic">Professor</hi>” K. in my Lex. letter, so I hunted up a copy (now scarce):—yes, you are right,—but that (nearly 20 yrs. ago) was correct then for a <hi rend="italic">short time only</hi>, when K. as “<hi rend="italic">Science </hi>Lectr.”—gave some teachings for a <hi rend="italic">time </hi>in Lincoln Agl. Coll. at Cy., &amp; <hi rend="italic">assumed </hi>that title: right, enough, perhaps, while <hi rend="italic">so employed</hi>,—as <hi rend="italic">our </hi>Captains, &amp;c. &amp;c. I noticed the other day, in a List of the Members of the Linn. Sy. (pubd. <hi rend="italic">annually</hi>), and <hi rend="italic">all have to give in their proper and respecticve titles</hi>, &amp;c—that K. has the face to call himself—<hi rend="italic">Chief</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Conservator of State Forests</hi>”—in italics: but <hi rend="italic">that </hi>is <hi rend="italic">the man</hi>! ever like the old Jackdaw!—–</p>
         <p>Thanks for the <hi rend="italic">Mao. Dy. </hi>come <hi rend="italic">quickly</hi>: have only just looked into it: (and <hi rend="italic">so </hi>w. his former one, <hi rend="italic">also </hi>Tregear’s—this last turned up the other day! among a <hi rend="underline italic">heap</hi>—in its orig. package). Between Wms.’ &amp; Tregear’s—there is <hi rend="italic">now </hi>no room for mine,—no <hi rend="italic">want </hi>either: still I should <hi rend="italic">like </hi>to have (if only A.!) printed: but, as I told Sir James—I can do <hi rend="italic">no more </hi>at my own expence. Enclosed I send your kind <hi rend="italic">outlay</hi>, w. thanks—also, a <hi rend="italic">slight hint</hi>, in a <hi rend="italic">memo. of yr. own </hi>(in newspaper), to show how you are a <hi rend="italic">loser </hi>by that kind of thing. I fancy you would make but <hi rend="italic">poor </hi>Treasr.</p>
         <p>I laughed over yr. <hi rend="italic">Cicada </hi>clipping! It is no “<hi rend="italic">pest</hi>”—it lays its eggs certainly in yg. soft branchlets of trees, &amp; <hi rend="italic">sometimes </hi>such break off—not always—the young larvæ from the branch (those “<hi rend="italic">fly blows</hi>” mentioned,) soon drop into the earth—whence they emerge in the spring, in their chrysalis state, &amp; climb posts, trees, &amp;c. &amp; bursting their back <hi rend="italic">rind</hi>, out comes the C.—It is the <hi rend="italic">true economy</hi> of Nature over again.</p>
         <p>The weather here, changed a <hi rend="italic">little </hi>for the better on Saty. Sunday (2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>.) &amp; ever since truly magnificent w. </p>
         <p>I went to town this mg. &amp; called on your dear Father—found him in the old Composg. Room, in the midst of a hundred things!! Books, papers, &amp;c &amp;c—(reminding me much of <hi rend="italic">my own </hi>such a tiresome <hi rend="italic">mess</hi>! here) I spent some time w. him—<hi rend="italic">so glad </hi>to see me, &amp; have some talk (mostly on astronl. subjects) but, alas! he is getting more &amp; more deaf; obliged to put up his own palm even when one bellows! &amp; then, sometimes, to do so 2–3 times. We spoke also of you: since my return I have looked out a wk. for him by an “M.A. &amp; Commander R.N.” proving (?) the <hi rend="italic">falsity </hi>of the Newtonian Astronomy, &amp; also that the Earth is <hi rend="italic">stationary</hi>, &amp; the sun <hi rend="italic">goes round it</hi>!! Your F. was looking well, &amp; <hi rend="italic">active</hi>.</p>
         <p>What more? I was at Meeanee last Sy. night, Ch. S., good &amp; pleasing Congn., returned at ix.30: next Sy. night (D.V.) to be at Taradale, &amp; return by Rymer on Monday. Tuke has been elected to Waipukurau, &amp; has resigned Taradale. I purpose going to Waipawa &amp; to Waipukurau next week—a money hunting! (which I <hi rend="italic">hate</hi>—but “if the mountain won’t come to Mt., why Mahomet must go to the mtn.”)—P. Gow &amp; wife (my old trusty acqs.) are again going to the Home of their Fathers, on a visit.—Did I ever tell you of <hi rend="italic">Luff’s</hi> “<hi rend="underline italic">Picture</hi>”? let me know.—</p>
         <p>I have been very well of late, excy. so on Sy. last, on retg. I <hi rend="italic">ran </hi>up this hill! in town today I walked a great deal. I visited Moreton’s Gally. of pictures—nearly 100 of his own taking—but all <hi rend="underline italic">alpine</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>scenery, grand but (dare I say it?) <hi rend="italic">too much of it</hi>. I told M. I wod. prefer knowing something of their <hi rend="italic">Botany. </hi>I go tomorrow to see the Bp., who is <hi rend="italic">very unwell</hi>, with Linseed poultices on his chest: he took the Waipukurau Ch. duty last Sy., &amp;, forsooth, must ride to Takapau for 3 p.m. S., &amp; riding back (against time &amp; wind) caught a fearful cold.</p>
         <p>In last week’s “Herald” Supplement is a capital “skit”—a long one too!—from the “Catholic Times”—well worthy yr. reading: it professes to be telegc. commn. between Ballance &amp; Co. &amp; the philosophers, <hi rend="italic">or Politicians </hi>in the planet Mars!! I rarely look at the “<hi rend="italic">Supplt</hi>.”—but it so happened that I did on Saturday last (pubd. on G. <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>) &amp; was vastly pleased. I heard today in town that <hi rend="italic">Fannin </hi>went to Wgn. on Thursday last,—he &amp; 1 son now lodge &amp; board at Mrs. Dick’s—not far from office.</p>
         <p>Today I settled my “shindy” with Jago—<hi rend="italic">re </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">1</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>of my “standard” ps., it was <hi rend="italic">detained </hi>under 3d. fine: however it came out, <hi rend="italic">at last</hi>, that it was 4 oz. &amp; <hi rend="italic">barely </hi>a ¼! (owing to an extra ½ sht. Py. proceedgs.) so I gave in &amp; <hi rend="italic">pd. the 3d. fine.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I think I told you of the pamphlet I had sent to Leipzig from the Bush to a Mr. F. Stephani last yr., having been returned to me w. 2–3 German P.O. notices—“not known.” When I came back to N., &amp; found his address, I sent it again—keeping dry its old wrapper w. Germ. <hi rend="italic">mottos</hi>: at same time writing to Stephani: I got a letter from him last wk., in which he makes (among others) this curious remark:</p>
         <p>—“There are several people of my name in this city and as the English write the large f so F and we Germans so F they have misunderstood the Christian name; no doubt they ought to have asked if the parcel might be meant for me—a long residence in this city entitles me to so much attention.” I give you all the sentence—but ’tis only the 2 <hi rend="italic">F’s</hi>. that puzzles me! for I cannot see any difference!!–(<hi rend="italic">Good night.</hi>)</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">6</hi>
            <hi rend="sup italic">th</hi>. In town this mg. called on Bp. (cost me 5/-) found him pretty well—getting nicely round. I shall be at Waipukurau, Ch. S., on 16<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. and probably 23<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>.—I was surprised to see at Craig’s a <hi rend="italic">Bible </hi>in <hi rend="underline italic">short-hand</hi>!! Pitmans: what next? In this day’s “<hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>” (I send) an excellent article</p>
         <p>             Good bye—Yours always</p>
         <p>                                                     W. Colenso.</p>
