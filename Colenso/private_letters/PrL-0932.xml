         <p rend="end">Dannevirke,<lb/>March 29<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1895.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>I feel inclined to write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> this night, although I have little of consequence to impart; but it is a rainy night &amp; I have no visitors; and I have nothing particular to occupy my mind—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> that I can manage <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>
         <p>Your long &amp; <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> &amp; ever-welcome letter of 7<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. I duly received, &amp; thank you for it; much pleased with the <hi rend="italic">good tidings</hi> therein respecting health of your family, &amp; trust such continues.—</p>
         <p>I came hither on Friday 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. in rain &amp; <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>,—snow on low ranges around. Mr. Robertshawe left for Weber District on Saty., retg. on Tuesday, while I had the Ch. Services here last Sunday: weather fair (cold &amp; showery <hi rend="underline italic">mg</hi>., but fine at <hi rend="underline italic">evg</hi>. when a <hi rend="italic">large </hi>Congregation,) I did intend to stop 1 night at Waipukurau that I might call on Mr. Grant, but as I left N. on the Friday instead of Thursday (owing to holidays in town, &amp;c) I put off my doing so till I return; another reason was, Robert’s wife leaving on Tuesday (son, also, w. her) for Wgn. on her way to Greenock, which helped to put us <hi rend="italic">all out</hi>: she left in Tongariro on 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>, &amp; their son returned to N. on Sunday last. We were surprised on Saty. last in hearing of the sudden death of W. Jones, for many years Driver of Cobbs’ Coach, &amp; more lately Landlord of Commercial hotel Woodville &amp; <hi rend="italic">my host</hi>, he drove a coach to &amp; from Eketahuna on the day previous, came back well, &amp; next mg. died—from rupture of internal blood vessels. I had sent him a book from Craig’s on the 20<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> for his eldest son Willie—a nice youth in 6<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Standard &amp; 1 of my juvenile Wdv. correspondents: as I well-knew them all, &amp; had purposed visiting them, I <hi rend="italic">wired </hi>to Mrs. Jones on Saty. mg. saying I would visit on Tuesday, 26<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., which I did, &amp; returned yesterday to this place.—While there I called on Lindauer, who is executing <hi rend="italic">several </hi>portraits, &amp; among them 1 of late Maori Kg., with other Maori celebrities—living &amp; dead:—and a very <hi rend="italic">nice </hi>portrait of Miss Buller (has Sir Walter <hi rend="italic">more </hi>than one daughter?) Eccles had been away for a month at N. Plymouth, on exchge. w. some minister there, &amp; just returned: I saw but <hi rend="italic">few others</hi> whom I knew. I wrote a pretty long letter to Buller this day, sympathising w. him on his great loss by <hi rend="italic">fire </hi>at his Country residence, &amp;, also, loss of “case” in Court; besides a few remarks on his “Author’s copies”, papers pubd. in “Trans. v. XXVII” as I heard from Lindauer that B. was shortly going to England. There has been several deaths lately at N., among them 2 steady Settlers,—1, Muir, a Blksmith. from Hastings (died in hospl. from cancer) &amp; 1, a Gardener named Webb, Havelock. And I see in today’s paper, that Albert Karaitiana (whose child was buried last wk. at Havelock) his <hi rend="italic">furniture</hi>, Cows, horses, buggy, &amp;c. at Clive, all taken under Execution Warrant, at suit of some Gisborne man, &amp;, <hi rend="italic">also</hi>, that he has subsequently become Bkrupt. I suppose you know, that Jardine is no longer Bptcy. Agent, &amp; that Mont. Lascelles fills that situation. I hear, today, that Bp. Williams is gone <hi rend="italic">N. for 3 months</hi> throughout that end of Diocese before winter; &amp; on his return moving this way. I do not (<hi rend="italic">at present</hi>) know how long I may stay <hi rend="italic">here</hi>—if I return early to N., then I <hi rend="italic">may </hi>pay another visit before winter, but I <hi rend="italic">cannot </hi>remain <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, having too much to do at N. I have received a very kind letter from Dr. Hocken together w. a pair of specs., slightly tinted &amp; suitable, he says, for my eyes, &amp; also a very kind &amp; pressing Invitation to visit Dunedin &amp; put up at his “nice &amp; comfortable house”—but this old m. <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be drawn! (So much the worse for “the old m.”, methinks I hear <hi rend="italic">you </hi>say.) Since my last to you I have had another bulky lot of “proofs”—Papers in “Trans.” to read, &amp;c., and now expect another lot—if <hi rend="italic">all </hi>my papers had passed. Hill is still at the N. Bp.W. was shut in “bar-bound” at Wairoa 10–12 days, Craig went over on 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi> night, got there the next mg., found Bp. on Wharf, who said, to C:—“Are you, too, come to be bar-bound?” C:— “No: to bring you away”: &amp;, sure enough, both came to N. on Saturday 16<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—(this from Craig.) Fannin is <hi rend="italic">evicted</hi>! orders to clear out! so rooms taken at “Herald” Off. Chambers: and I shall <hi rend="italic">never more </hi>enter Fannin’s <hi rend="italic">old</hi> office! it is wanted for H.M. <hi rend="italic">Customs</hi>. Tiffen is making many 1000ds gallons of wine at Green-Meadows, and <hi rend="italic">strangest </hi>of all (Wgn. paper) Saunders, Teetotaller, &amp;c, &amp;c, supporting the Distilling of Whiskey (pur et simp.) <hi rend="italic">here in N.Z.</hi>, to save our money going to Scotland. I suppose you <hi rend="italic">know </hi>that Balfour is <hi rend="italic">out </hi>of office: his successor, a Mr. Somerville from Fiji, 9 yrs. there Mgr. of Bk. N.Z. a pleasant man to talk with.—–</p>
         <p>I note, w. pleasure, your account of those beautifully <hi rend="italic">silvered </hi>ferns—this reminds me of those I used to see at Murphy’s Club Hotal, Wdv.—which I have also written about in one of my papers. I well remember Neilson: an old favourite of mine, still living there &amp; as active as ever (indeed, <hi rend="italic">much more so </hi>of<hi rend="italic"> late </hi>years) is Fredericksen, an <hi rend="underline italic">aged</hi> Swede who itinerates among his people preaching, and I encourage him—tho’ I cannot speak his lang.—all through an Interpreter. Hope <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may have the ptg. “Polyn. Quarterly”. <hi rend="italic">So </hi>their high &amp; mighty crowned President Patroness is <hi rend="italic">out</hi>! (that snobbish nerve on part of Smith &amp; Co. mainly kept me from joining) and now Bp. W. is put in! (another <hi rend="italic">similar </hi>move, as he can <hi rend="italic">never </hi>attend) I shall enclose 2–3 clippings: if the one <hi rend="italic">re </hi>M. Lexicon &amp; W.C. is already known to you perhaps you may be able to tell me, whence <hi rend="italic">I got it</hi>! I have quite forgotten.—–</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Fine</hi> apples &amp; <hi rend="italic">good sorts</hi>, for sale at 1d. per lb. here, Bush Dist. &amp; at Wairarapa, but no demand—3d. 4d. <hi rend="italic">retail</hi> at N.</p>
         <p>And now my dear Sir, once more Goodbye. I am tired: Kindest regards to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—<hi rend="underline italic">all</hi>, &amp; best wishes for your prosperity. Ever yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                                           W. Colenso.</p>
