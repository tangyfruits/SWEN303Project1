         <p>Dear Mrs. Hill</p>
         <p>It is a very long time since I last had the pleasure of seeing you, (indeed, I might have said the same of Mr. Hill until 2 days ago, when I was agreeably surprised with his kind visit, and <hi rend="italic">your very kind </hi>message,) but then you live so far away from <hi rend="italic">me </hi>(this <hi rend="italic">old </hi>man!) with your many &amp; growing maternal cares and duties—with the wet winter season only just closed, and my long absence (nearly 2 months) in the Bush!——</p>
         <p>Next Monday night (7<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.), however, if fine, being strong moonlight, I hope to see you both together at this, the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, Meeting for 1889: and that over, I again flit away to the Bush!</p>
         <p>In town this morning, I called in at Craig’s, &amp; seeing—among a lot of newly-arrived and pretty things,—a very nicely got-up book highly illustrative of the recent grand wedding,—I somehow thought, that you would like to see it, (provided Mr. Hill had not already forestalled me, but then I knew he was so very busy this week,)—and so I ventured to purchase one for you, which I send with this, and beg your acceptance.</p>
         <p>With kind regards,</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
   </text>
