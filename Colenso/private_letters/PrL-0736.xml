         <p rend="end">Tuesday night <lb/>4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>In our much talking last night we (or I) forgot some things—so I called to see you today, &amp; then went to Hamilton’s,—you had <hi rend="italic">just left him</hi>: I felt <hi rend="italic">too tired</hi> to return.—–</p>
         <p>1. I wished to show you an advt. in “N.Z. Herald” of 25 Jany. re the little new book,—price 1/- postage 2d, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>2. Also, to say—If you were writing to your friend Mr. B. by <hi rend="italic">this Mail</hi>, you should have my reserved copy for him: (of course, it is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> too late.) I hope to receive a few more copies shortly—<hi rend="underline italic">I need them</hi>.</p>
         <p>As you said, you would be leaving for Wgn., soon, perhaps you may write, or send, to Mr B. <hi rend="italic">before</hi> you do so—to go by next S.F. Mail,—if so, <hi rend="italic">this said copy</hi> is at your service <hi rend="italic">for him</hi>: your brother could call for it.—</p>
         <p>3. Enclosed is Chq. for £1.1.0, my subsn. for ’90—to the “Ph. Institute”—I send to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as <hi rend="italic">the Treasurer</hi>: I mentioned it to Mr. Hamilton this mg.—–</p>
         <p>4. Did you notice in “D.T.” of <hi rend="italic">last</hi> evg. Johnston’s <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> (?) remark on Rev. Mr. Wallace &amp; myself! &amp;c, &amp;c. How frequently that fussy person goes astray in his prolix &amp; lengthy communs.—</p>
         <p>Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
