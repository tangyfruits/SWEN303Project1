         <p rend="end">Baddeley’s Hotel,<lb/>Dannevirke.<lb/>Novr. 12/87</p>
         <p>Mr. R.C. Harding, <lb/>Napier.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I have entered on my 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. week of Country &amp; Bush life, &amp; have often thought of writing a few lines <hi rend="italic">to you</hi>—especially since receipt of your last No. of “<hi rend="italic">Typo</hi>”:—though I should greatly prefer an hour’s quiet &amp; uninterrupted chat: now, however, that it is <hi rend="italic">again</hi> raining, and I, of course, confined indoors, I will sieze this golden opportunity, &amp; try to improve it.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Imprimis</hi>; <hi rend="italic">re</hi> “Typo”: I was greatly pleased w. it, &amp; not the least so w. portion <hi rend="italic">re</hi> J. Vogel, which (to tell you the truth) was much increased when I found Ed. “Evg. News” opposing <hi rend="italic">particularly</hi> that portion. I fear, my dr sir, in your strenuous labours to <hi rend="italic">raise</hi> the (or <hi rend="italic">our</hi>) craft, you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> appreciated here in our little place, (which <hi rend="italic">you should</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">be</hi> by <hi rend="italic">all printers</hi> &amp; Pg. Offices at least,)—but it is only the old old story— “a prophet” (teacher of any kind) “is without honour in <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> Country!” Moreover the mind only sees what the mind brings, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>I note your saying, you intend again referring, &amp;c., to our “Jubilee” paper in your next no. of “Typo”. In your doing so (if agreeable to you) I should like for you to notice the quotation I <hi rend="italic">read</hi> from Lubbock, before I began my paper. If I had met w. it earlier, I should assuredly have inserted it, somehow: for it is exactly what I said and wrote &amp; <hi rend="italic">taught</hi>, 30–35 years ago; and for which I have so largely suffered from that narrow-minded &amp; too dominant clique, &amp; having brought that slip away w. me, I enclose a copy.</p>
         <p>I see in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> mg’s. “Herald”, notice for next Monday’s meeting: some of us cannot be there—Hill, Bowerman, self, &amp;c. Did you hear of Peacock? poor dear fellow, <hi rend="italic">while at our last meetg.</hi> w. his wife he recd. telm. of <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi> death of his mother! Whom he was preparing to receive at Xmas. (P. had also sacrificed his <hi rend="italic">night’s </hi>wages to be present! &amp; no doubt, but for that stunning news would have spoken to the matter before us.</p>
         <p>I was surprised to hear of sale of Dr. Spencer’s <hi rend="italic">Library</hi>, I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> begin to fear he may not return to us. Bowerman, too, dissolving p-p., &amp; leaving N. “for good”:—a loss to our Sy. and doubly so to me—all my old friends &amp; acquaintances, in or near to my usual line of going &amp; returning from town are gone! Bowerman, being near to his place on 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. (holiday), very kindly came <hi rend="italic">in rain</hi> to see me and wish “Goodbye”! I <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> his leaving. Well: ere long, I, too, <hi rend="italic">must </hi>bid <hi rend="underline italic">my final</hi> “Good bye”—to you &amp; to all: but is it to be a <hi rend="underline italic">final</hi> one?—————–</p>
         <p>Did you see a late atrocity? the <hi rend="underline italic">title</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">-page</hi> to Cat. of Dr. Spencer’s auction. I think I never saw the like!—</p>
         <p>Now I close; with very kind regards—to Father also.</p>
         <p>                             Believe me, yours truly,</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
