         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Hawke’s Bay,<lb/>June 24, 1850.</p>
         <p>Secretaries, <lb/>C.M. House, <lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs, </p>
         <p>1. My last short letter to you was in February of this year. With it I forwarded a portion of my Journal down to Feb. 16/49, and a copy of a letter which I had just sent to the Archdeacon.</p>
         <p>2. I now send you another small portion of my Journal down to June 8/49; and a copy (translated) of the Appendix to my letter to the Archdeacon, and also a copy of my letter to the Bishop. </p>
         <p>3. I returned on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of April from my usual autumnal tour throughout the District. At Wairarapa myself &amp; nearly 200 native communicants (many of whom had assembled thither from a distance to partake of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Supper) were greatly disappointed in the non-arriva1 of the Rev. Mr. Cole, who was absent with the Lt. Govr. at Taranaki; but of which we knew nothing till after our arrival at Wairarapa. </p>
         <p>4. Nothing very particular among the natives has lately occurred in the neighbourhood. The disaffected party are <hi rend="italic">now</hi> both (outwardly) quiet and inwardly vexed; so that I see but little of them.</p>
         <p>5. On the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. ulto, at 6 p.m. a very severe shock of earthquake was felt, which made us all leave the reeling houses as quickly as possible; it was the most severe of any we have hitherto experienced, &amp; lasted about 1½ minutes; we, <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>however, received no damage. On the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst. our Station was again inundated through the late heavy &amp; almost continual rain, &amp; we feared the worst as the mouth of the river was dammed up, but we were again providentially delivered from our fears. A large portion, however, of a new totara fence was torn up, and some timber &amp; 6 goats carried away, and the whole place, including garden, transformed into a most miserable quag through <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> &amp; water. About 3 weeks since I had a public interview with the principal chief, Te Hapuku, and other chiefs, at his village, relative to my proposed removing to Waimarama; to this, however, he would not consent unless I purchased the site for which he modestly demanded £200! I am, therefore, still hedged in. His wish is, I know, to keep me by his side on account of medical &amp; other collateral aids.</p>
         <p>6. I have been, and still am, suffering much from Rheumatism which is increasing in the violence and duration of its attacks. Such is the loss of strength and mental depression attendant upon it, that I have been unfitted for almost everything. I believe that it is in a great measure to be attributed to the unhealthy low &amp; wet spot on which we reside; to which, doubtless, our continual headaches also owe their origin. </p>
         <p>7. I have not yet heard from the Lieut. Governor or the Bishop. But from the Archdeacon we have lately had a kind sympathising Letter, in which <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>he says (Vid. letter of April 6, 1850.) “I have just been reading your long account, and must express my entire satisfaction with the statement you have made, and my conviction of the hard measure dealt out towards you. ‘If when ye do well &amp; suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable unto <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>.’ I doubt not you will see hereafter that good will arise out of this evil. It seems clear that there was deep rooted evil in the heart of Leonard—this had begun to shew itself in the careless apathy of his conduct during your absence from home, and hence the necessity of his removal when amendment appeared to be hopeless,” We have also had similar letters from others of our brethren, particularly from Mr. Baker, (who, during his residence at Turanga in the Archdeacon’s absence, had ample opportunities of seeing and conversing with several Chiefs who went there from this neighbourhood), he says:— “Your public letter to the Archdeacon of Feb. 25 I have read very attentively.—I have grieved much over the events mentioned in that letter; they are of a very painful character. You have indeed been in the hot fire of persecution. The treatment you have received from your people exceeds all I have ever heard of in this country. A viler proceeding has not yet been known in N. Zealand. The source from whence this persecution has arisen is clearly traced to Leonard, your chief Teacher, &amp; upon whom you appear to have bestowed greater attention than to any of the others; what base ingratitude! What a complete Judas he has proved himself to be! I can <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>very closely enter into your circumstances, knowing your ardent zeal for their good, and only receiving in turn the abuse of those who ought to manifest the greatent sense of obligation”. Leonard, the ex-teacher, is now at Manawatu, endeavouring to stir up some of his own tribe against me, and still threatens vehemently what he will yet do:—but our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> lives &amp; reigns.</p>
         <p>8. There has been no little talk among the Settlers at Wairarapa, and the inhabitants of Wellington concerning the late ill-usage which I “The Natives’ Friend” have received from them.—May I be allowed to request, for my family’s satisfaction, that you will kindly grant the loan of the copy of my letter to the Archdeacon with its Appendix to my cousin,—the Rev. J.W. Colenso of Tharston Hall, Long Stratton, Norfolk?—And, should he draw upon you for £20 (Twenty pounds), please honor his draft and charge the same to my account. </p>
         <p>9. I have not yet received any answer from you to my Letter of Decr./46.—I trust, I have still the confidence of the Comee. of the C.M. Society. </p>
         <p>10. I hope to send you some more of my Journal by an early opportunity. And—desiring to be constantly remembered by you in your prayers—am, my dear sirs, </p>
         <p>with every respect, </p>
         <p>Your mo. ob. servant, </p>
         <p>William Colenso. </p>
