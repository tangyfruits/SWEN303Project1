         <p>Dear Mr Harding</p>
         <p>I am <hi rend="italic">again here</hi>! &amp; again <hi rend="italic">thinking on you</hi>—&amp; so I write. Several things combined cause me to have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> much in mind:—1) the enclosed clipping from a Paper I brought w. me: 2) our Lecture meeting last night, “in aid of <hi rend="italic">Presbytn</hi>. Ch.”—it was well attended, closed at x. 30—all, I hope, well pleased; it (my L.) was supplemented w. 6–7 songs: Mr. R. Stewart, Chn., who did well.—(3) my seeing in a Paper the sale by auction of Capt. Cook’s log. book (?) in London for £30. (How could this be?) (4) my noticing <hi rend="italic">this day</hi>, a big advt. in “Herald,” re <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Almk. now their’s: (5) your cousin, Mr. R. Harding, being here yesty. (w. Herrick &amp; Williams) on Sowry’s matter—but their work suddenly stopped [<hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi>.?] by Injunction from Sup. Ct.!! I think, I have given you reasons enough—though I still have others.</p>
         <p>I wrote to you from N. on 10<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.–11<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., &amp; left N. for Dannevirke on 18<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., came hither on 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. (there being no train on 23<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>.) &amp; shall return to Dvk. on 27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.—Saturday.—Weather fine, yesty. stormy, &amp; this night, <hi rend="italic">very fine</hi>.</p>
         <p>On Monday aftn. the newly-appd. Lay-Reader here, Mr Clarke, called on me, &amp; among other matters, wished me to preach next Sy., which (of course) I refused.—I <hi rend="italic">much </hi>fear the Congn. is <hi rend="italic">much </hi>disappointed—no doubt <hi rend="italic">they </hi>expected too much, &amp; Mr.C. has <hi rend="italic">much</hi> to learn: but, if he will only quietly &amp; <hi rend="italic">contentedly </hi>work upwards from the lowest rung of the ladder, he may (aye, perhaps, certainly will) succeed: I hope so—if he <hi rend="italic">has the root of the matter in him</hi>. I fear, however, he expects too much at beginning.——</p>
         <p>I went over this mg. to see, <hi rend="italic">our </hi>old townsman, (and often my pol. foe! in Pl. Council, &amp;c.) W.W. Carlile, but he was <hi rend="italic">not </hi>at home; although this was my fixed day for seeing him: Lanauze came up, yesty., unexpected, on business, and so C. had to ride w. him.—However, I <hi rend="italic">may be here again in about a fortnight. </hi>I may truly say, I shall lose 2 days this week, through the train <hi rend="italic">not </hi>running!—</p>
         <p>I am pretty well: though on Tuesday mg. on leaving my room I had <hi rend="italic">an extra 2 hours of severe Rheum. </hi>owing to <hi rend="italic">no </hi>fire <hi rend="italic">in sitting room &amp; window open </hi>to the Sy.!! through carelessness of a <hi rend="italic">new </hi>servant. To say the truth—I feared I was done for!</p>
         <p>Of course you will have heard of Ormond <hi rend="italic">wholly </hi>resigning—&amp; of Swan (!) being brought forward in <hi rend="italic">his stead</hi> &amp; by O’s. party: I regret this.—–I hope Capt.R. may be re-elected:—Tanner (I hear) will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> again come forward—<hi rend="underline italic">right</hi>. Did you notice the <hi rend="italic">scathing </hi>remarks in a late “Dy.T.,” copied from a R.C. paper on our late Parliament? But I don’t greatly care, now, for pol. matters.—only, I hope, trust, wish, &amp; pray that rank &amp; low Democracy may <hi rend="italic">never</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">prevail</hi>. Perhaps there may be a letter from you <hi rend="italic">at Dvk</hi>: &amp; if so, shall be ansd. thence (D.V.) next week. Hope your little son is improving fast—that Mrs. Harding &amp; yourself are both <hi rend="italic">quite </hi>well, &amp; w. kind regards, I am—</p>
         <p>Yours very truly, W. Colenso.</p>
