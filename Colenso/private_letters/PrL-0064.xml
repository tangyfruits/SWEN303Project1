         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Hawke’s Bay,<lb/>New Zealand, Jany. 20. 1847.</p>
         <p>Rev. J. Venn,<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c<lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have only <hi rend="italic">very recently</hi> received the afflicting tidings of the death of our very dear and faithful friend Mr. Coates. It came upon me most unexpectedly—and occasioned great searchings of heart—I thought much and prayed earnestly that <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> would raise up a suitable person and direct the Parent Comee. to such an one to fill that important post—rendered doubly so in these critical times. And now I have been refreshed and gladdened indeed, in hearing that you have accepted that situation. Oh! my dear Sir, may <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> Almighty bless you continually for your having so acted, and make you a blessing in every way to your numerous missions. I can not tell you the thoughts—I dare not give vent to the feelings—of my heart. It seems to me to be not a little analogous to the death of Moses when Israel was about to enter into the Promised Land—at <hi rend="italic">the</hi> time when apparently such a Leader was most needed; yet, through God’s foresight and providence, more than made up in Joshua—may it be so now. Amen.<hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>
         </p>
         <p>I wrote a long letter to Mr. Coates in June last, which perhaps may have safely reached the C.M. House. My Letter was a <hi rend="italic">Confidential</hi> one, and I was led to write as I did to our lamented friend, in Consequence of a Note from him, bearing date “May 31/45” (but which was a very long while in coming hither) in which he says— “Pray continue to write fully and unreservedly . . . . . . . . write to me private Letters if you wish it.”—Believing then, as I do, my dear Mr. Venn, that in many (may I not say <hi rend="italic">all</hi>?) matters concerning the welfare of the C.M. Society—the spread of Evangelical Religion through her instrumentality—and the benefiting and improving of her Missions (i.e. Missionaries and Converts)—your heart is, like that of your predecessor in Office, already given and firmly fixed, I have no scruple whatever (confiding in my belief) to keep me from desiring that that Letter, written by me and addressed to Mr. Coates, may be received by you as if in every respect it was written to you <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>yourself. You will therefore please accept it and use it as you may deem proper.</p>
         <p>I hope, my dear Sir, it will be in your power to obtain the few articles for me (for my Natives), which I have requested in that Letter: and, if so, to cause then to be forwarded viâ Wellington without loss of time, for my day is slipping fast by, and night is at hand.</p>
         <p>I hope, also, (D.V.) soon to write you again, and to send you the remainder of my Journal. Please acknowledge these 2 Letters at your earliest convenience, and craving an interest in your prayers</p>
         <p>       Believe me ever,</p>
         <p>               Rev. and Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>       Very sincerely &amp; obediently yours</p>
         <p>                       William Colenso.</p>
