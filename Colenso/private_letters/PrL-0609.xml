         <p>Mr D.P. Balfour </p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Late though it is I have determined before I drop tools for a week, to reply to your note of the 22nd; and so (if I may) have done with letter writing for a short season as next week (and month) I must stick to my Dicty.—having lost so much time. Your letter surprised me—not a little, I assure you—to find you had so <hi rend="italic">quickly</hi> parted with your fossil Tibia which you had said, in yours of last week, <hi rend="italic">you were going to keep</hi>—and this I re­gretted.</p>
         <p>The Moa bone I have returned to P.O. for you; it was, I fear far too imperfect to be of any real service. Mine were mostly from P. Bay. I sent them to C.Church yesterday.</p>
         <p>I am very much better at last; P.D. was here on Friday night, &amp; will be here again on Monday evening; he is leaving for Australia. I hope you are keeping quite well.­</p>
         <p>Having put you to unnecessary expense in stamps, I enclose ½ doz to make up.</p>
         <p>I am</p>
         <p>Yours truly </p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
