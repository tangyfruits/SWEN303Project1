         <p>D. McLean, Esq.,</p>
         <p>     &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>For the last week or more I have been going to write to you—but I am <hi rend="italic">so busy </hi>every day that I have not found time—until I have been much too fagged.—</p>
         <p>What I wished to say to you is—that, in the event of Sir G. Grey coming hither to see these Natives, (which, I suppose, he will be sure to do,) <hi rend="italic">do you come with him or be here while he is here</hi>—for, I have heard enough to convince me, that some of those Natives will make great attempts to get back some portions of Lands <hi rend="italic">bona fide </hi>sold by them to you &amp; paid for by you,—to alter boundaries—to represent their not being half-paid, &amp; so on.—And I much fear they are organizing among themselves deep laid schemes of this kind, &amp; mainly against yourself. You know them well enough to know, that they will scarcely dare to do any thing of the kind to your face—but, your being absent, is quite another thing.—“Now or never”—is their belief—&amp; I almost fear they are <hi rend="italic">privately </hi>encouraged by some <hi rend="italic">whites</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I hope you are well.—I have heard nothing (be Letter) from your city since I left. I have suffered a great deal—throughout 10 weeks—from severe Rheumatism. The <hi rend="italic">present </hi>warm weather is however doing me much good—more than all the medicine I have taken—though I am not yet free from pain.</p>
         <p>Our Natives are very quiet—notwithstanding Bousfield’s outrageous conduct—it is (I think) charitable to conclude him to be a little “cranky.” The Natives are leasing (after their fashion) on all sides. Will they not fall out about <hi rend="italic">division </hi>of utu reti? Hapuku &amp; Urupene are now almost at war—no doubt they would if they could.</p>
         <p>I should greatly like to know <hi rend="italic">the fate of that letter of mine to W. Tamihana</hi>—given into the hands of Wi Maehe of Rotorua.—Did it ever reach Wi Tamihana? or was it delivered to some white <hi rend="italic">not very far from you</hi>? When I gave it to W.M. <hi rend="italic">the Bp’s. Native was with him. </hi>Try to know whether W.T. recd. it.</p>
         <p>     Believe me ever                 My dear Sir</p>
         <p>                     Yours sincerely</p>
         <p>                             W. Colenso</p>
