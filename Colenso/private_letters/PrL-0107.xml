         <p>D. McLean Esq.,</p>
         <p>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Mrs Colenso gladly avails herself of an opportunity to send you a little Butter—to which I add a few nuts—having nothing better of fruit kind to offer.—</p>
         <p>There are however a few bottles of gooseberry &amp; elder wine remaining which are wholly at <hi rend="italic">your </hi>service.</p>
         <p>I saw a <hi rend="italic">Brig</hi> off on Saturday which (at first) I took for the Govt. Brig—but afterwards supposed to be a whaling one.</p>
         <p>I suppose you heard of my “Maumauhaere-noa” to Molangiangi: whence I returned on Friday 4 a.m.</p>
         <p>I should like to know when you may be coming this way—that I may be at home when you call.</p>
         <p>I should have told you, that the 2 vols. of “Mitchell’s Travels in Australia,” which you so kindly lent me, are still here.</p>
         <p>There is a young scamp of a Chief belonging to Ngatihineuru Tribe, but who chiefly resides at Tangoio, called Mohi Tarapuhi, of whom you should know something.—As, (in addition to his having taken a <hi rend="italic">second </hi>wife,) he has very recently taken away from her husband the <hi rend="underline italic">mother</hi> of his 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. wife! with whom he is boldly cohabiting: relying upon our forebearance &amp; his nuinga.—</p>
         <p>       Believe me</p>
         <p>               Yours truly</p>
         <p>                       W. Colenso.</p>
