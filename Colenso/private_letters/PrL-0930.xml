         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand,<lb/>March 18<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1895.</p>
         <p>My dear nephew William,</p>
         <p>I wrote to you on 26<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. Feby., and in it I said, “I would send you a few seeds for your friend,” I have this day endeavoured to fulfil my promise &amp; send you by this mail some seeds, and hope they may grow &amp; flourish: and in order to keep their vitality I have put some up in their own ripe state, without removing their pulp or fleshy part, but drying them as they grew, and in order the better to preserve the cleaned 7 <hi rend="italic">dried</hi> ones (seeds), I have put them separate in a tin Canister; some are from shrubs in my garden here, and some that are sea-side plants should do well in the slopes of lower Lariggan.——</p>
         <p>By this Mail (or, rather, these <hi rend="italic">two </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">Mails</hi>, both closing together) I am sending in duplicate the <hi rend="italic">promised</hi> £<hi rend="underline italic">1000</hi> in a draft to the Mayor and Treasurer of your Borough. I returned from Dannevirke on the 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst., and found his cablegram here awaiting me, informing me briefly of his and your <hi rend="italic">acceptance</hi>.—and as I wish to lose no time, and to have done with it, and so have it off my mind, I have <hi rend="italic">finished</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">my work </hi>at it. Do you &amp; your Co-workers see that it is laid out <hi rend="italic">well &amp; securely</hi> for the good of the poor of P.—</p>
         <p>I return to Dannevirke again on 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. as I have to take the Ch. Services there on 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., to allow Rev. E. Robertshawe, the resident Minister, to visit a lot of scattered Settlers living apart and many miles away, with no proper roads yet to their Homes.—–</p>
         <p>I am keeping well: weather here still fine. I suppose it is rough and blustering with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. I have a keen recollection of <hi rend="italic">March </hi>winds &amp; weather at Home, which I always disliked.</p>
         <p>This week, our Town is almost given up to holidays! <hi rend="underline italic">today</hi> St. Patrick’s day (Banks &amp;c close), <hi rend="italic">tomorrow </hi>first day of Races: <hi rend="italic">Wednesday </hi>a whole holiday—all hands for Races—&amp; so on.</p>
         <p>I enclose a memo. of the seeds &amp; fruits now sent: I hope you and yours are <hi rend="italic">all well</hi>, and with kind regards, love, &amp; best wishes</p>
         <p>I am, my dear Nephew</p>
         <p>Yours affy.,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. In your letter you expressed a wish to see <hi rend="italic">advertisement</hi> of my town properties sold here in October last: I have lately procured you a paper containing it which I send: all were sold—of course—at <hi rend="italic">low </hi>figures (compared with Govt. valuations) 2 sections in Hyderabad Road, valued by Govt. <hi rend="italic">underlings</hi> at £100. ea. I put them up at £20. ea., sold for £26. ea. The <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> proceeds of the sale, already <hi rend="italic">more </hi>than gone.                                        W.C.</p>
