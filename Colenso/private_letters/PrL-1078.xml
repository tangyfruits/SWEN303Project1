         <p>In sending you Dr. Spencer’s paper (now to hand from him with Drawings), I would just observe,—that his remarks in pp. 1 &amp; 2, (partly gathered from Dr. Hooker’s “Hand-Book,”) gave rise to much discussion, at the reading of his paper. I, for one, showed (rather warmly) <hi rend="italic">the utter impossibility </hi>in <hi rend="italic">past</hi> years of any one of us in N.Z. having all the requisite means for carrying out such a work—including., of course, <hi rend="italic">time</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> place, </hi>&amp;<hi rend="italic"> quiet</hi>, (which indeed, he himself has lamented!) and that, while Dr. Hooker had made those remarks (yet not exactly in the way in which Dr. Spencer had done,) still, he himself, had <hi rend="italic">wintered </hi>here in B. Islands, and had done nothing in that particular branch! Moreover, I thought that Dr. Spencer was pretty fairly supplied with many valuable works of authority in the subject,—as Ralf’s Desmideæ, Hassall’s f.w. algæ, Hooker’s (f. &amp; son) <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> setts, Montague’s Sylloge, Microg. Dicty., &amp;c, &amp;c. I see the Doctor has toned down his introduction—a wee bit, (which, he had, in part, promised to do,)—and has, also, left out something more; but I would that he had not come out quite in that style: besides, Maskell has been hard at work on the Desmids. I introduced Dr. Spencer to Mr. Maskell, and now, I hope, they may work well together.—Of course, <hi rend="italic">all this is private</hi>.</p>
         <p>Our President (Waiapu) has just returned to us from his <hi rend="italic">long</hi> tour, and I arranged with him yesterday for a Meeting of Council on Tuesday next,—the main subject, to secure a proper room <hi rend="italic">for ourselves only</hi>, which we sadly want: I have 2–3 plans in contemplation: more anon.—</p>
         <p>Thanks for your kind note of 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I am now hard at work on 2 papers for our Society: both nearly finished.—Hope you are <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> well: and am,</p>
         <p>             Yours ever,</p>
         <p>                             Wm. Colenso.</p>
