         <p rend="end">Wellington<lb/>July 17, 1862.</p>
         <p>His Excellency<lb/>Sir George Grey, K.C.B.<lb/>Governor of New Zealand<lb/>&amp;c    &amp;c  &amp;c</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>I do myself the honor of briefly addressing you with reference to a petition from myself to Your Excellency which accompanies this letter.—</p>
         <p>I should not venture, Sir, to trespass upon your valuable time at this particularly important and busy period, were I not necessitated to do so in consequence of the very extraordinary decision of the Civil Commissioner of the Hawke’s Bay District, lately given in his Court there against myself.</p>
         <p>Should you not, Sir, be already fully acquainted with that Case, you will find it faithfully reported (<hi rend="italic">copied from the Court record made by the Magistrate’s Clerk</hi>,) in the Hawke’s Bay “Herald” of June 28<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>My principal reasons, Sir, for losing no time, in both writing to you and forwarding my Petition, are:—</p>
         <p>1. That you may early have a faithful outline of the whole matter:—</p>
         <p>2. That you may certainly and quickly know, that I neither had, have, or can have any intention or desire at all approaching towards anything of a factious or embarrassing nature;—but, on the contrary, a most hearty disposition to aid Your Excellency in your zealous endeavours after the good of the Natives. (Hence, also, Sir, I early seek to acquaint you of my wishes lest I should be again misrepresented.)</p>
         <p>3. That, as a sworn and loyal subject of Her Majesty the Queen, I should lose no time in informing you, Sir, that I have very good reasons for believing, that the desire of the “King” Natives of Hawke’s Bay, to have back the small piece of Land at Te Awapuni, is only a beginning (as it were) of a trial of strength on their part, as to how far a sanctioned and written Deed in which Her Majesty the Queen is the Grantee can be broken; and, if so, to follow it up by seeking to have other Deeds broken in which Her Majesty is also the Grantee, the matter of a consideration (as in the case of other Deeds) being to them of small moment.—</p>
         <p>You, Sir, who have known so much of this people, must be aware, that, with them, a “<hi rend="italic">tapu</hi>” (in the name of a powerful chief) can never be broken. If, however, such should be done and permitted, then the “<hi rend="italic">mana</hi>” of his name would necessarily be greatly lowered, or gone for ever. Now Her Majesty’s name, in this said Deed, (taken in connexion with the utter irreversibility of the gift— “<hi rend="italic">mo ake ake ake</hi>,”) is, <hi rend="italic">to them</hi>, very similar:—at all events is quite a cognate idea. I may add, that Mr. Commissioner MacLean, always took this (my) view of the case (with reference to the 10 acres at Te Awapuni); believing with me, that to set aside the Deed of Gift would prove a dangerous precedent (and this was our opinion long before any of the late troubles or demands arose).</p>
         <p>Moreover, according to <hi rend="italic">their own</hi> customs, the Natives would never have once thought of seeking to remove me, or to regain possession of the Land, had they not been (in 1853–4,) incited and encouraged to do so. The very facts of their having called my “<hi rend="italic">waka</hi>” to shore—publicly selected my abode—stepping out the boundaries, fencing it in, and building my dwelling-house (<hi rend="italic">the principal Chiefs</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">with their own hands</hi>) and my clearing it, and raising food—having children born, and my own blood shed thereon—each of these, much less all—would have constituted a legitimate claim in their eyes—and according to their established customs and usages.</p>
         <p>Should Your Excellency, however, be pleased to determine the said Land to revert to them;—I would beg to suggest, (to save, if possible, any future trouble from them,) that such should be done under your own Deed and Seal, and not upon the mere word of one of your Officers.—</p>
         <p>In making those remarks I trust Your Excellency will clearly perceive, that I am not actuated by any desire to retain Waitangi: (to me it is, and must ever be, a place of many associations pleasant &amp; unpleasant,—and time was, when I could scarcely have borne the loss of it:) believe me, Sir, I only seek that which I conscientiously believe to be for the common good of the Colony.<note xml:id="ftn2-57" place="foot" n="57">
               <p> Minute added: “Mr Gisborne! write to the Bishop of New Zeeland stating that Mr Colenso proposes to give up this land on receiving £300 compensation for his improvements &amp; request the Bishop to inform the Govt. whether Mr C. has received at any time allowances or compensation from him or the Ch. Missionary Society... W. Fox 21.7.62The Bishop of N.Z. 22 July/62—Selwyn replied on 4 Aug. that he had never had any pecuniary trans. with Colenso and had forwarded his letter to the Bishop of Waiapu.</p>
            </note>
         </p>
         <p>It was my intention, Sir, not to present my Petition until I had received an open Letter to Your Excellency, signed by the <hi rend="italic">early</hi> Settlers and Magistrates of Hawke’s Bay, bearing testimony to the truth of the same, which should accompany it. For the above-mentioned reasons, however, I desire to lose no time; and I hope you will allow me to forward on to you, Sir, the said Letter on my receiving it.</p>
         <p>I have the honour <lb/>  to be,<lb/>Your Excellency’s<lb/>  obedient humble Servant,<lb/>            Wm. Colenso.</p>
         <p>To His Excellency Sir George Grey, Knight Commander of the most honorable Order of the Bath, Governor and Commander in Chief in and over Her Majesty’s Colony of New Zealand and its Dependencies, and Vice-Admiral of the same, &amp;c, &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>The Petition of William Colenso, Clerk, Provincial Treasurer and Inspector of Schools for the Province of Hawke’s Bay, and member of its Provincial and Executive Councils, and also of the General Assembly of New Zealand.— </p>
         <p>Humbly sheweth:—</p>
         <p>That your Petitioner came to New Zealand in the year 1834, as a Missionary from the Church Missionary Society. </p>
         <p>That your Petitioner, though often performing long and difficult Journies, mainly resided in the Bay of Islands till 1844. </p>
         <p>That during the whole of that period your Petitioner never once broke the rule of the C.M. Society—viz. not to acquire nor possess Land from the Natives.—</p>
         <p>That in the year 1844, your Petitioner came to Ahuriri to reside, (which place he had visited in the previous Year) being sent thither by the Bishop of New Zealand.</p>
         <p>Thst among other stringent conditions imposed by the Bishop of New Zealand upon your Petitioner, on his coming to Ahuriri, (having previously limited him to the use of ten acres of Land,) was this, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, that he should not hold nor acquire any Land wlthout his consent.—</p>
         <p>That your petitioner was the first European Settler in the Ahuriri, among a little-known, fierce and untractable Tribe.—</p>
         <p>That your Petitioner dwelt on a small piece of low land of ten acres at Te Awapuni in Ahuriri aforesaid; which Land was freely and publicly ceded and given by all the Chiefs, Owners, in the year 1845 to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, by regular Deed of Gift, drawn upon the spot in the New Zealand tongue by the present Bishop of Waiapu, (as directed by the Bishop of New Zealand, and advised and sanctioned by your Excellency’s predecessor Governor Fitzroy,) to be by the Crown re-granted to the C.M. Society. </p>
         <p>That soon after, or within two Years or your Petitioner’s coming to Te Awapuni to dwell,<note xml:id="ftn2-58" place="foot" n="58"> Inserted, “By whose authority was he located upon the land.”</note> the Natives who were formerly the Owners of the said small piece of ceded Land, seeing that your Petitioner had laid out very largely upon it,—in Building, Fencing, Planting, Draining, and Sowing Grasses,—began to demand payment for the same, (as well as for many other things which lay wasting and rotting around, such as drift firewood, flax, raupo, reeds, cockle- shells, pumice-stone, etc. etc.,) and which demand they, for a considerible time, never ceased to reiterate, and that often in a very obnoxious way.</p>
         <p>That at that very time, (and indeed throughout the whole of the period of eight years—from 1844 to 1852,—during which your Petitioner remained in connexion with the C.M. Society,) your Petitioner regularly used and spent all that he could devote of his Salary (never laying anything by) besides sundry gifts from Christian friends in England, in feeding and clothing his large Infant School, and many other children of the more distant natives, as well as the numerous sick and infirm of his large District, and also in procuring glazed windows doors and furniture for Native Chapels and School-Houses: no allowances having ever been made to him by the C.M. Society for any of those purposes. </p>
         <p>That your Petitioner never once paid to any of the Native Grantors of the said ten acres of Land anything as payment or as rent; always firmly meeting them with the statement, that the transaction had been closed: and he fully believes, that, in due time, his constant firmness on this point had its desired and proper effect.—</p>
         <p>That during those eight years of heavy toil and no little hardship, your Petitioner never once left his District: for which, and for the great and unexpected improvements within the same, he, in March 1852, received the thanks and congratulation of the Bishop. </p>
         <p>That in December, 1852, your Petitioner's connexion with the C.M. Society suddenly ceased.—</p>
         <p>That in the following month (January 1853,) the very large and strongly built Dwelling-house of your Petitioner, (which had but lately been quite finished,) was,with all its contents, and the adjacent out-houses, entirely destroyed by fire. </p>
         <p>That by that calamitous accident your Petitioner lost everything he had, (save a portion of his Books, which were in a detached building,) among which were many valuable zoological and fossil specimens—the unwearied collecting of nearly twenty ears.—</p>
         <p>That up to this time, (and, indeed, till 1854,) your Petitioner did not possess a foot of Land in the Colony. </p>
         <p>That in March, 1853, the Bishop of New Zealand (accompanied by Your Excellency) visited Ahuriri: when the Bishop wished your Petitioner to leave the place on which he had so long resided, and which he had mainly at his own expence made habitable; but which your Petitioner (considering himself hardly used, after nearly twenty Years heavy Service, and being nearly destitute, without means or resources, or any other New Zealand home,) refused to do,—without, at least, compensation for his outlay and improvements: the said Land not having been granted to His Lordship the Bishop of New Zealand, nor required by him for a future Mission Station, in consequence of the then recent removal of the Natives from its neighbourhood, and, also, of a very large block of Land having been recently granted for that purpose at Te Aute. </p>
         <p>That shortly after, two, out of five, Native Grantors, instigated (as your Petitioner believes,) by European influence, endeavored to induce your Petitioner to remove from the place. </p>
         <p>That, subsequently, the Bishop of New Zealand applied to the then Crown Land Commissioner and Resident Magistrate (Mr Domett) to eject your Petitioner. </p>
         <p>That your Petitioner was afterwards written to professionally from Wellington by the Bishop’s Solicitor there (Mr. Brandon) to cause your Petitioner to give up both possession and also the Deed of gift.—</p>
         <p>That your Petitioner (by his Solicitor, Mr. Hart,) still demurred to do so without equitable Compensation. </p>
         <p>That, in 1858, a Government Surveyor (Mr. Kempthorne) was sent by the Chief Native Lands Purchase Commissioner to survey the said piece of Land, in order to a Crown Grant being issued for same to the C.M. Society; to which Surveyor the Native Grantors pointed out the boundaries. </p>
         <p>That one of the Native Grantors—and perhaps the principal one of the original five—the Chief Puhara, (who was unfortunately slain in battle by Karaitiana and Renata in 1858,) though a steady supporter of the R. Catholic Religion, not only always advocated your Petitioner's remaining, but, with his last words to your Petitioner, (in the presence of Te Hapuku,) besought him never to give up or leave the same.</p>
         <p>That of the four remaining Native Grantors, one, Te Waaka Te Kawatini, to your Petitioner’s certain knowledge, is most averse to the said piece of Land being taken from your Petitioner: and, further, that your Petitioner has very good reasons, for believing, that another of the said four Grantors (Te Hira Te Ota) is still (as he ever has been) averse to such being done.—</p>
         <p>That your Petitioner has learned from unquestionable authority that the Natives who severally addressed both Your Excellency and the Hon Mr. Fox, (et Te Pawhakaairo and Matahiwi,) on your recent visits to Hawke’s Bay, concerning the said piece of Land, were Renata and Paora Kaiwhata, Natives having no real interest in the reversion of the said Land, not being original Grantors of the same, nor belonging to the Grantors’ <hi rend="italic">hapu</hi> or family. </p>
         <p>That your Petitioner has not himself for the last four Years been either told by the Native Grantors to quit or to pay rent for the said Land, though frequently seeing and conversing with them.</p>
         <p>That nevertheless your Petitioner has reason to believe that two of them (Karaitiana and his brother-in-law Tareha,) do now (since their connection with the Native “King”) wish to have the said Land back. </p>
         <p>That your petitioner was summoned on the 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. June last, to appear in Court to answer an information (laid under the Native Land Purchase Ordinance of 1846,) charging him with being in occupation of Native Lands; That you Petitioner appeared on the 23<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>. of June before the Civil Commissioner, by whom your Petitioner was fined ₤<hi rend="underline italic">5</hi>., (although, as your Petitioner believes, totally unsupported by evidence, and also upon illegal and unauthorized information,) and ordered forthwith to give up the said ten acres of Land at Te Awapuni to the Natives.</p>
         <p>That your Petitioner is not now greatly desirous of retaining possession of the said piece of Land, especially if it be the wish of Your Excellency that such should revert to the Native Grantors.—</p>
         <p>That your Petitioner however believes, from his long experience and knowledge of the Native character, and particularly from their present unsettled and unsatisfactory notions, that such a step as the destruction of any sanctioned Deed of Land, however small, formally and publicly granted to Her Majesty the Queen of England, would not be a wise one; and one assuredly to be followed by demands for similar concessions, wholly or in part of other Deeds of Land, transferred by them to the Crown. </p>
         <p>That your Petitioner therefore respectfully submits for Your Excellency’s consideration, whether it would not be more advisable under all the circumstances of the case (now that the Trustees of the C.M. Society have expressed their determination not to apply for a Crown Grant in trust for the said piece of Land,) to direct that the aforesaid Native Grantors be paid by Your Excellency’s Government for the said piece of Land.—</p>
         <p>Lastly, that if it be the wish of Your Excellency that your Petitioner should forthwith leave the said piece of Land,—together with the houses, gardens, field, brick chimnies, fences, and other improvements thereon), that Your Excellency will be pleased to take into consideration the facts narrated in this Petition, and to direct, that your Petitioner be equitably compensated for his real improvements on the said Land, to be determined on the spot by fair and equitable arbitration:—, or, should it be Your Excellency’s wish to have this (already disagreeable) matter closed as quickly as possible, you’re your Petitioner (in order to save any further writing, trouble, or delay,) would be willing to yield up possession, etc. on his receiving the sum of <hi rend="underline italic">₤300</hi> (Three Hundred Pounds) as Compensation for his Improvements and fixed Property which must necessarily be left.—</p>
         <p>And your Petitioner will ever pray.— </p>
         <p>William Colenso </p>
         <p>Wellington, <lb/>  July 17th, 1862.</p>
         <p>To His Excellency Sir George Grey, Knight Commander of the most Honorable Order of the Bath, Governor and Commander in Chief in and over Her Majesty’s Colony of New Zealand and its Dependencies, and Vice-Admiral of the same, etc. etc. etc.—</p>
         <p>We, the undersigned, early settlers, magistrates, and land proprietors in and of the Province of Hawke’s Bay, having carefully read the Petition of William Colenso of Napier to your Excellency dated Wellington July 17, 1862, do hereby certify that we have long known the said Petitioner: that we believe his statements in the said Petition to be correct: and, that we heartily recommend to your Excellency’s favorable consideration the Petitioner’s Prayer for equitable compensation—should it be Your Excellency’s wish that he should leave the piece of land referred to by him in his Petition.—</p>
