         <p>Dear Hans Mortensen</p>
         <p>I have been thinking on you, &amp; yours, very much of late, and this day I have been working a bit for you. I believe you asked me some time ago for copies of the little books, or Papers, I had been writing about New Zealand, and I have promised to send you some; but here is the difficulty, I think I had already sent you one, or two, and if so, I have forgotten all about it, and I should not like to send you the same twice over. However I have this day looked you out <hi rend="italic">two</hi>, which I shall send with this.—</p>
         <p>I have also put up for you, that is, for your two dear little children, some toys of a nice kind, which will serve to keep them quiet and interest them in wet weather: these toys are more than 30 years old,—they did belong to my own children when young, and I have always greatly prized them (far more than they were worth) on that account, and I don’t think I would part with them to any other person.<note xml:id="ftn3-745" place="foot" n="745"> The Mortensen children played with the “Colenso blocks” (Ball OE 1997. <hi rend="italic">The families of “Fernhills” and their Garfield neighbours, pioneers of Norsewood</hi>. Feilding).</note> I also send some <hi rend="italic">small </hi>books, which may be of some little service—these also, or some of them, were my own childrens.—</p>
         <p>The big book, the New Testament and Psalms, is for your father-in-law, with <hi rend="italic">my love</hi>.—</p>
         <p>I said, I had been thinking much on you of late:—this was owing to my <hi rend="italic">not </hi>being able to have my talk with you, when you kindly came to see me on Whitsunday (2nd June), owing to my town friend, who had not seen me for 2 months, calling at the same time, and he had also fixed that hour by letter, so that I could not well alter it. I was not a little vexed with myself about it. Another matter that has caused me to think on you, and my old Norsewood friends, was a letter I received last week from Charles Clemett, telling me he had joined “the Army” as a soldier. It both surprised and grieved me very much: I have written to him a very long letter, (being my last,) showing the errors and false teaching of those miserable deluded credulous folks.</p>
         <p>I hope you &amp; your wife may be able to get hold of that letter and read it quietly and attentively, and look-out also the passages of Holy Scripture I have brought forward in it. In many places where I have been I hear Norsewood (or the Scandinavians) laughed at, for being so easily beguiled by every strolling sect, who seem to make a good thing in their way out of Norsewood: I fear, my dear Hans, your countrypeople are very credulous, very superstitious, too easy to believe any quack, or talkative fellow.</p>
         <p>But I must close: my thumb is much better, but is far from well yet. I write with my fingers only, and exert myself to do so. Good bye.</p>
         <p>Kind regards to you &amp; yours.—–</p>
         <p>Believe me Yours sincerely,                W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>No.2. Wednesday night, 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <note xml:id="ftn3-746" place="foot" n="746"> Auckland Museum MS 58, Box 5, Folder 3.Year and month not given. June 1895 is the first Wednesday 19th after his injury, and the content fits this date.</note>
         </p>
         <p>I could not make up your parcel yesterday, and this day I have done my best, but it was an ugly job, altogether, owing to my thumb, so <hi rend="italic">painful</hi>, and always “<hi rend="underline italic">in the way</hi>”!—</p>
         <p>However I have also added some seeds from plants here in Garden: If you noticed a <hi rend="italic">Large-leaved </hi>tree near this house when you were here, that is the cork-tree, “<hi rend="italic">Hauama</hi>”, the little books for children, you can give away if you do not want them.</p>
         <p>Weather here fine but cold, much colder I think thence with you.—I am keeping well, Good bye Dear Hans, Kind regards to your good wife, and love to the dear children. I hope you may receive the parcel all right. Do not be in any hurry to write to me about it. Believe me,</p>
         <p>                           Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>                                           W. Colenso.</p>
