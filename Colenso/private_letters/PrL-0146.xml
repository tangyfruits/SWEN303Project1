         <p>&amp;c &amp;c</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I am just returned from Te Hapuku, and I lose no time in giving you (in a few words) the result of my Mission.—</p>
         <p>He says—that he cannot comply with the demand to leave on Monday next:—that he has no faith in their (Te Moana &amp; Tareha) promises; and even if kept by them, would not be binding on others; as, according to the Nat. Custom, the promise of any Chief, <hi rend="italic">when respected</hi>, only binds his own immediate followers; and that in the case of the firewood, &amp;c. at Wakawiti, after the first skirmish, which was to be allowed to be taken away, on Te Ẁatuiapiti vacating that place, before it could be all removed it was thrown into the river, &amp;c; &amp; that, 2 days ago, on a canoe drifting, when Peehi, Puhara’s native was sent after it, &amp; Moana said it should be given up, while he &amp; the Chief were tangiing over Puhara’s death, Tareha &amp; party took away the canoe up into the pa—so that their words are devoid of <hi rend="italic">mana </hi>&amp;c:—that, <hi rend="italic">the only </hi>way he can remove, is, by degrees <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, his Ploughs &amp;c &amp;c <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, women &amp; children <hi rend="italic">lastly</hi>, himself—&amp; this has been re-echoed (to day) by <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi>: that he never will forsake his people, women, &amp;c: that the other side has boasted their soon getting women slaves, &amp;c:—that you have no force, nor means of controlling them: and that they know well, that, though in following him up &amp; killing him, you could not afford to be very <hi rend="italic">vici</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">they know you want their Lands</hi>, &amp;c &amp;c: and as to returning to take away any thing, or <hi rend="italic">after </hi>leaving to think of having the Crops, are <hi rend="italic">unheard </hi>of things in Native Warfare; that his enemies would grab all, &amp; in all likelihood kill not a few of those, who (following out the notice given) might be left.—</p>
         <p>He thinks he is safe against their attacks where he is, for some time at least: &amp; speaks of moving at his own time—<hi rend="italic">Ngahuru</hi>.</p>
         <p>Cows, &amp;c., were driven inland yesterday, &amp; Horses this day. —</p>
         <p>I cannot help thinking there is a deal of truth in what he says: and, that the other party should either listen to reason—or, must do their worst.</p>
         <p>I write this in great hurry to go to Grindell: pray excuse it. And believe me</p>
         <p>     Yours very sincerely</p>
         <p>             W. Colenso.</p>
