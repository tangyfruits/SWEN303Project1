         <p rend="end">Napier June 27<lb/>1866</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>I received your note of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst., and thank you for it. Marvelling at your not having earlier recd. mine sent to you at “the Bay”. And, also, at your not noticing my main question in my last relative to the Mss. which I had brought from Wgn. Now however that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are (justly) entitled to receive packages per Post <hi rend="italic">free</hi>—I send you the said Mss. by this Mail, &amp; not by our Mr. Ormond, [who is no greater friend of mine now than he was last year: alas! for politics]. As I said before to you (I think) or perhaps Dr. Eccles—I scarcely know how this Mss. came to be packed up by me—save, that it—with many other <hi rend="italic">similar sized </hi>packages, (specimens, &amp; Parly. Papers,) were all cleared out together, &amp; sent to Lyon’s to be packed with some Books &amp; papers of mine. I did not even find it out here for some time after my return—and then <hi rend="italic">I fully </hi>expected <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to return to Wgn. by this Coast:—but enough of this.—</p>
         <p>I wonder whether it will ever be published? — —</p>
         <p>— — — — — —</p>
         <p>However the 2 main subjects of my present note,—are,—1. Can <hi rend="italic">you frank packages </hi>per Mail <hi rend="underline italic">to England</hi>? I wish to send some roots (<hi rend="italic">Caladium</hi>) to Hooker for Kew by next Mail—and I shall forward them hence to you—so far, I know your “jurisdiction” extends. Gisborne kindly franked the last for me from Wgn. to Dr. H. and those roots then sent “arrived in splendid condition” so that, if you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>, G. <hi rend="underline italic">can</hi>, and I have <hi rend="italic">no doubt will.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>2. I am now sending by this Mail my first 2 elementary English Maori Books to Col. Russell—(contg. about 220 pps. Mss.). I need not say to you, I think,—I would that Mantell were Nat. Minister, or Dr. Shortland, or even Mr. Weld: I have had several letters from Col. R.—all of a severe <hi rend="italic">martinet</hi> style, which <hi rend="italic">I don’t like</hi>, and which cannot be productive of good.—I see that M. is (rightly) Member of the Leg. C.—(I am glad he is, and D. too,) and I wish you to ask him, <hi rend="italic">to seek to see those Mss. of mine now sent</hi>—I think he can do this very well, from his having been N. Minister, and from our having corresponded (officially) <hi rend="underline italic">largely</hi> about the work. I may also tell you, that Col. R. &amp; myself do mot speak to each other—ever since the Waitangi affair here, (which M. understands,)—though I believe, the fault as to silence <hi rend="italic">is his own</hi>.—His last offl. letter to me (written <hi rend="italic">after receipt of mine</hi>, which shewed him how things were, and how my engaging in Public duties, and in, &amp; for, N.Z. exhibition, had thrown me back, &amp; how I would try hard &amp; get these 2 parts (now sent) ready by 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. June,)—informed me—he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have <hi rend="underline italic">all</hi> by 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. June, he would give no longer time, &amp;c, &amp;c. (He might as well have asked for Jupiter’s satellites.) In doing what I have (especially <hi rend="italic">in the copying plainly for press</hi>) I have burned a good deal of midnight oil!—but the great difficulty with me in <hi rend="italic">plain </hi>writing is, the loss of my thumb—all being done w. my fingers.</p>
         <p>Perhaps you, or M. might mention to Sir George of the Mss. being sent to Wgn.—and Sir G. might wish to see it. All I want is <hi rend="italic">fair play</hi>,—&amp; not to be left <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> to Col. R. (who knows nothing of Maori) &amp; to the clerks in his Depart.—</p>
         <p>With you, I regret my not visiting Wgn. at this time—I confess, I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> expect it last year, although a little, very little reflection would have served to shew, the hopelessness of my contest in such a small Province as this with its Superintt. Had I known such would have been the case, I should have troubled you much more in your <hi rend="italic">Sanctum sanctm.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Excuse this, written in my rough way.—I have lots of letters, &amp;c. to answer—having set aside my own private work &amp;c for those Mss.</p>
         <p>We have had a little rain this morning, the <hi rend="underline italic">first</hi> for many months! Therm 62°! this mg. Bar., last week 30<hi rend="sup">5</hi>/<hi rend="sub">10</hi>ths. most unusual weather.—A <hi rend="underline italic">very</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">warm</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> wind </hi>yesterday from NW., our warm quarter.—I long to see you &amp; to hear your account of <hi rend="italic">your </hi>
            <hi rend="underline italic">N</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">. travels</hi> &amp;c., in which I am greatly interested. Believe me</p>
         <p>Ever truly yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S.—I may also add, that Col. R. said, if such &amp; such were not done, he would not recommend any appropriation for the Lexicon.!!!</p>
         <p>You can, if you think well of it—shew this scratch to Mr. Mantell.</p>
