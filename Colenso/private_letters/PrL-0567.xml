         <p>Mr. H. Lund,<lb/>    Matamau.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>A few days ago I heard from Rees Watkins that you were now stationed at Matamau: I was pleased at hearing this, and also, that you would have spare time; as I supposed you would now be able to secure good specimens of ferns.—–</p>
         <p>And further, in thinking over the above, I have also concluded to ask you to do me a little favour, believing it may be in your power up there in those woods.—</p>
         <p>There is a small tree there, of which I wish to get the seeds. It is a curious one, and I dare say you have often noticed it: it grows erect, with a tall &amp; slender stem, its leaves are <hi rend="italic">very long</hi> &amp; narrow (in its young state), stout, and coarsely notched:—it is sometimes called the Lance wood tree, and its long and pliant stems are often used as handles for whips for the bullock teams.—I have seen plenty of young trees on the dry ground near Norsewood.</p>
         <p>I should like some seeds, and fruits (as they grow) and flowers,—but this is not the season for flowers.—</p>
         <p>If you should meet with any, and could send me a parcel (by post or rail), I should be obliged. You can also speak of it to Birnie the P.O. Keeper at Matamau who might help you.—</p>
         <p>I hope you are well,</p>
         <p>and am, Yours truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. I have seen the leaves nearly 2 feet long, &amp; less than 1 inch wide. They are straight, thick, and variegated.       W.C.</p>
         <p>Also, any other curious or novel thing you may find near you at this season of the year.—Fine mosses, in fruit; curious Fungi.</p>
         <p>W.C.</p>
