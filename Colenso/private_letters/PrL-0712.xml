         <p rend="end">Napier, March 25/89</p>
         <p>Mr. Wm. Gordon’<lb/>New Plymouth.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I duly received your kind &amp; welcome letter of March 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., with its accompaniments. I am much obliged to you for <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, and should have replied long ago had I not been hindered—(1.) by ill health (though <hi rend="italic">now</hi> very much better), and (2.) by writing to England—which I finished (for the time!) on 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. inst.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, thanks for the photos. of the L.P. I find 2 of them much <hi rend="italic">darker</hi> than the rest, and very fair copies of your clever artistic work, showing-up better those Maori carvings &amp; the ornamental Initial letters, which were so indistinct in the former one you kindly sent me.—I enclose a Postal Note for 15/- to pay for them with their attendant expenses postage, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>I have also to thank you for your photo. of a “pen &amp; ink sketch of a study table”:—it is certainly a quaint medley of all sorts! and if it be (as I take your words to mean) one executed by you, really &amp; wholly copied with pen &amp; ink, it is a truly wonderful performance: but I should rather suppose many of the papers, sheets, &amp;c.,—shown, to have been first reduced in size by photography &amp; then promiscuously arranged, &amp;c. I have only very recently unrolled the packet, and so have not yet had any opportunity of showing the photos., living, as I do, retired from town!——</p>
         <p>Since my last I found from a young friend of mine here that he had some years ago purchased at Nelson a copy of the photo. of your L.P.—I find you are right as to the Maori of it being in accordance with that in the P. Book (ed. 1858): I had merely looked into the Bible (N.T.), 1868, and found the difference, which from reading yours I had suspected, viz. “N<hi rend="underline">a</hi>uterangatiratanga”, for “N<hi rend="underline">o</hi>uterangatiratanga”. I note what you say as to the Eng. translation adopted:—I cannot, however, admire it.—</p>
         <p>I am almost inclined to grieve over my not having earlier known both you and your work;—it seems to be of that kind (or branch) of art on which my heart &amp; mind has long been set; I would have encouraged you to the utmost, and thank you for persevering in your praiseworthy efforts against the flowing tide of public opinion. Unfortunately, however, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, my time is <hi rend="italic">past</hi>! and I really cannot—must not, (much though I may wish it,) take up with any new &amp; desired correspondence.——</p>
         <p>If, however, you have spare time, and you could send me faithful &amp; clear copies of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Maori carvings you know with their distinctive names, I would pay you for them. As I have reasons for believing there is a gr4eat difference between many words used at Taranaki and the W. Coast,—and by the Maories here on the E. Coast. I had a Taranaki Maori living with me some 40, or more, years ago, and in his W. Coast dialect I detected much difference, but I had no time then to attend closely to such things. And about 4 years back, when the Government called in their Officers throughout the Colony, residing in Maori Districts, or having dealings with Maoris, officially in the Gazette, to aid me in all my enquiries for the “Maori Lexicon”,—all responded promptly save those at Whanganui and N. Plymouth,—who did not even afterwards reply to my letters to them!!</p>
         <p>And like as I had not even heard of your valued &amp; prized photo., so you (you say) “had no idea that the voyage of the canoe was ever doubted”!! It is more than 30 years since I first wrote about it; and since then <hi rend="italic">often</hi> in separate papers on the Maoris, but in no case exhaustively or completely; so that I cannot point out <hi rend="italic">one </hi>paper or article to you; but in vol. I. “Transactions N. Zealand Institute” (published 1869), you would find pretty much to interest you on this subject: (and a copy of <hi rend="italic">this volume can be obtained at Wellington</hi>; as, owing to that Paper of mine, (an Essay on the Maoris, originally written for the Dunedin Exhibition of 1865,—assigned to me by Sir G. Grey &amp; the Imperial Commissioners), that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> volume of the “Transactions” went through a 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> edition: then, also, in vols. XI, XII, XIII, XIV,—in my series of long Papers on “the Ideality of the Ancient New Zealanders,”—there is more or less reference to that myth, which I am sure would gratify you;—and those Papers would have been followed by more from me completing the series, had not <hi rend="italic">certain untoward </hi>circumstances prevented.</p>
         <p>Unfortunately, Taranaki and Whanganui seems to have stood aloof  from all scientific matters,—never yet having formed a <hi rend="italic">branch </hi>Institute. I hope, however, you have a Public Library at N. Plymouth; and if so, then in it those vols. I have referred to.</p>
         <p>Does the “beautiful <hi rend="italic">Clianthus</hi>” grow commonly with you—or, on the W. Coast? In vol. ZVIII, “Transactions N.Z. Institute”, I have defined &amp; described <hi rend="italic">2</hi> species—the N., &amp; the S. one.</p>
         <p>I think I enquired in my last, Why the Rengarenga is termed, in your description of the carvings, “the <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> lily”? Do you know why? Or, is that Mair’s saying?—</p>
         <p>I cannot exactly tell you the origin of Te <hi rend="italic">Kooti’s</hi> name. If he is a Baptized Maori (which I take him to be), then, no doubt, it is that of some pakeha—ancient or modern—transmogrified! (as is so often the case):—or, it may be from the English word—the Court, thus maorified <hi rend="italic">Te Kooti</hi>: but, in any case, the pronunciation is <hi rend="italic">not </hi>that of “Te Kuti,”—neither “caught,” nor “court;” but is merely the <hi rend="italic">long</hi> English O, as in dole, hole, pole.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">[two thirds of page cut off]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>And now, I think, I have answered your letter.———</p>
         <p>I shall be pleased in hearing again from you: because I feel much interested in your old &amp; long labours. But, though I have now</p>
