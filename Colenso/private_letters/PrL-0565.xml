         <p rend="end">Napier, June 13<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1884.</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Your letter of the 4<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst., is <hi rend="italic">now </hi>to hand: and I hasten to reply by this outgoing mail of to-day to your city.—</p>
         <p>1. Re Mr. McDonald’s election: our plan has been to re-elect,—but there will be <hi rend="italic">no </hi>difficulty about it: I will call on Mr. McDonald during the coming week, and put things in order.</p>
         <p>2. I thank you for writing to <hi rend="italic">me </hi>on this matter: we (or they) have been in a bit of a muddle, but as my “report” (prepared in January) has been at last! printed (in May) you ought to have received copies long ago: I will endeavour to get you one sent next week.</p>
         <p>3. I enclose a clipping from our locals containing the advertisement<note xml:id="ftn3-242" place="foot" n="242"> The newspaper advertisement for Colenso’s <hi rend="italic">In Memoriam</hi>—see, for example, <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 4 June 1884 p.3 advertisements, column 2.</note>
            <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the “papers” you mention,—now in the course of printing (advanced to 40 pages): the little book is scarcely a “private publication” though approaching to it.<note xml:id="ftn3-243" place="foot" n="243"> WC: printed at <hi rend="italic">request </hi>of those who had heard it read, &amp; who were subscribers to the former little book.</note> You will see, that, like those 3 Papers of mine printed here last summer, these were also originally written for our Society,—and now enlarged with copious notes, &amp;c., mainly for H.B. settlers.—</p>
         <p>There will be, I suppose, a <hi rend="italic">few extra </hi>copies for sale, (as of the former book,) and if so, the price will be 5/-—but to subscribers 4/-—If the Auckland Institute (or any one else) wishes to <hi rend="italic">subscribe</hi>—you will be in time to do so, up to (say) July 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>. Sir G. Grey has subscribed for 6 copies: Mr Justice Gillies, and a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> others of your Province are also subscribers.</p>
         <p>                             Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                                             W. Colenso.</p>
