         <p rend="end">Napier, April 1/93</p>
         <p>Dear Sir James Hector</p>
         <p>For some time past I have been thinking of writing to you—and now that I have <hi rend="italic">to send you</hi> the accompanying “proofs” I do so.</p>
         <p>I wish to ask, If I write a paper containing a few peculiar striking events—facts, adventures! (strange yet <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, showing what I had to meet &amp; put up with from the then principal chiefs of these parts,) during my first 10 years of residence 1844–1853, would you receive it for Trans. N.Z. Institute?—</p>
         <p>I ask this question:—</p>
         <p>1.) because I have been repeatedly requested to make such known and more recently (among others) by our mutual friend Sir J. Hooker.</p>
         <p>2) To write a paper which (again) might <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be published by you, would cause a large waste of time to  me;—as having lost so largely by former publications of such papers here, I should not be inclined to print again at my own cost.</p>
         <p>3) I could, of course, at one or more of our branch meetings, give those facts <hi rend="italic">orally</hi>—aided by a few notes from my Diary: which, of course, would be the <hi rend="italic">easier </hi>mode for me, though not, perhaps, the most satisfactory one to some; yet, what would be very interesting, at a meeting, might not prove the same to readers—just as in some Lectures &amp; Sermons!</p>
         <p>4) and, as I suppose you do not see our local papers, I may mention that recently, I had to deny point blank the truth of a long statement which appeared in our Morning Paper <hi rend="italic">re </hi>a battle-royal <hi rend="italic">here</hi>! between the Bp. of N.Z. (Dr. Selwyn) and a prominent tribal Chief; written, too, in a <hi rend="italic">taking</hi> kind of style: fortunately <hi rend="underline italic">I could</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> meet it</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Should you deem such a paper to be scarcely suitable—please tell me so <hi rend="italic">plainly</hi>: as such as announcement <hi rend="italic">from you</hi> shall make no difference to me.—</p>
         <p>     Trusting you are keeping very well, I am,</p>
         <p>             with kind regards,</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                             W. Colenso.</p>
