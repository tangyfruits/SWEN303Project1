         <p rend="end">Wairarapa, April 3/52.</p>
         <p>Dear Mr. McLean, </p>
         <p>Your kind note of Feb. 5 duly reached the Mission Station, but being myself absent at Patea, &amp;c., (a second time! this season.) I did not get it until my return; when, there being no opportunity for Wellington, and I only at home for a few days, I brought it with me, intending to answer it during my journey hither, as I expected to meet Mr. Hadfield in the valley.—</p>
         <p>As I have not any desire to become a Land holder, save for my own residence or use, and as I have not the most distant intention of ever moving farther South, and as (as you state) Scrip will not be received in exchange for Land about us at Ahuriri, I must consequently give up all thoughts about obtaining any—and am really sorry that I have given you so much trouble on my account—at the same time, thanking you heartily for having so kindly interested yourself on my behalf in this matter.—</p>
         <p>Your pencilled note, written (I believe) from Te Waipukurau, I also received—and, some time in January I visited Hawea. I did not go very far in, as I did not like the aspect of the country thereabouts.—</p>
         <p>I have also called on Mr. Park, who very kindly shewed me his Map, &amp;c., but as I neither know how, or when, the suburban land of the Ahuriri <hi rend="italic">City</hi>! will be offered, (nor size of allotments, nor price) and as the want of firewood in all that locality is a great drawback to a person selecting thereabouts, (unless he had some specific object in view), I am still at a loss how to act.</p>
         <p>I think it is likely, I may go upon some of the Native ground (unbought) in order to be near them, and out of the way of others. It is high time that I should do something in the matter.—</p>
         <p>I have also to thank you for the Newspapers—sent and promised—and shall always welcome a note from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, whenever you may have time and inclination n to write.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Colenso was well when I left—ditto, the children who often speak of you, &amp; of your travelling together so far as Te Pokonao, &amp; of your horse, &amp;c.—And I am very sure that Mrs. Colenso would wish me to remember her kindly to Mrs. McLean &amp; to yourself did she know of my now writing—and</p>
         <p>Believe me, </p>
         <p>Dear Mr. McLean, </p>
         <p>Yours sincerely, </p>
         <p> William Colenso.</p>
