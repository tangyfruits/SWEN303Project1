         <p>Dandeson Coates, Esq.,</p>
         <p>Secy. C.M.S.</p>
         <p rend="end">Paihia, Bay of Islands, Novr. 19, 1844.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>1. My last Letter to you was dated May 30/44, per Mr. James Busby, since which I have received yours to me of Decr. 4/43, authorizing me to draw upon you for the sum of £50, on a/c of the late Mr. G.D. Browne—this I have subsequently done, having drawn two Setts of Bills of Exchange, (one, No. 12, for £30, to order of T. Addeman, and one, No. 13, for £20, to my order,) at 35 days Sight and dated August 9/44 upon you for the said Sum of £50. I should have written to you immediately on drawing those Bills, but as I had reason to believe they would not be presented at Salisbury Square for some time, and as there would soon be an opportunity <hi rend="italic">direct </hi>for England (by which vessel I now send this letter), I delayed the doing so.</p>
         <p>2. The Bishop was pleased to admit me—together with Mess. Hamlin, Chapman, Jos. Matthews, &amp; C.P. Davies,—to Deacon’s Orders, in the Church at the Waimate, on the 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. of September last. It was a solemn time—one to be ever remembered by us all. The Service was in the Native Language, and the Church was crowded to excess. I trust that <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> will ever supply all our need through Christ Jesus for the work to which we have been called; and that your prayer and wish for me, as expressed, my dear Sir, in your last Letter,— “determine to know nothing among the New Zealanders save Jesus Christ and Him Crucified,”) will be graciously answered. During the term previous to our Ordination, we each had a series of essays to write, (on “the Creation and Fall of Man, Redemption, Justification, Regeneration and Adoption, Renewal and Sanctification, The Sacraments, The Church, and the Duties of the Christian Ministry,”) and which I thought might prove a great obstacle, if not an insurmountable one—to my being admitted to Orders. However, fearing and preparing for the worst, looking up for strength and direction, and leaving the event to <hi rend="smallcaps">God, I </hi>wrote on each subject—and that without concealing or altering the doctrines I had already embraced and preached,—and was much and most unexpectedly gratified to find that all of my essays received the imprimatur of the Bishop; with scarcely any correction or remark,—none whatever in doctrine,—<hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>to <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> alone be all praise, who in this, as in many other instances, was greater than my fears! Having by <hi rend="smallcaps">God’s</hi> help surmounted this difficulty, another presented itself—in the shape of a circular Letter from the Bishop, sent to each of us for our consideration and consent (vide, enclosure, No.1.). This Letter (unfortunately for my peace of mind at such a period) was sent to us in the fortnight preceding the day of Ordination, and, after having considered it, we were each to have a <hi rend="italic">private</hi> conference with the Bishop upon the subject of the same, to which honor we were selected according to our standing in the service of the Society! consequently I stood in my lot as the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. person though I knew that those who preceded me had consented to the Letter <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>; and knew, also, from conversation with the Archdeacons that they approved of it, I could not bring my mind to do it, and so I told the Bishop, with whom I was closeted, on this occasion for more than 5 hours, Archd. Williams being present.—I particularly objected to par. 1, alleging I could not subscribe to it without the Consent of the Society, adducing what the Society certainly states, in “Appendix II to the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. report,” p.xi, (in an extract from a Letter of the Bishop of Calcutta,) and, also, in “No.V. Appendix to the 43<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. report,” p. 138,— “the Committee unquestionably and avowedly possess—the appointment of spheres of labour, the temporal power, including pecuniary support.” And, in answer to plain questions put by the Bishop, further told him, that I could but consider myself always bound to obey the Society. On this the Bishop plainly told me, unless I would subscribe to the Letter he would not ordain me; when, seeing I had <hi rend="italic">no one</hi> to hold with, and, that I had been already a long time shut up from active service, that if I ventured to refer the question to the Society my very doing so (not to mention other matters of which I had no reason to be careful) would perhaps have always powerfully operated against me, and that Archd. W. Williams expressed opinion before the Bishop, that he saw no just reason whatever for my refusing to subscribe to that Letter—I assented to sign it. I confess, not with the full consent of my Conscience. There is one thing, it is true, which cheered me—a ray of light in the midst of gloom—the declaration of the Bishop, that in signing I only bound myself for the seven years mentioned in the Letter, after which time I was free from what I then bound myself to. <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>And, I also considered, that you had not made any remark in your two last Public Letters, concerning me, although I had more than intimated—both in my Letter of May 19/43 as well as that of October 2/43—the great probability of my being sent to the Southward, and which Letters you had acknowledged the receipt of. If, however, I have done wrong, I am sorry for it: I hope I have not: <hi rend="italic">I am sure I have not willingly</hi>: and I am equally sure that I will do all that man can do towards reparation: but let me hear from you, my dear Sir, on this head. My head and mind is somewhat confused, for I have been sadly knocked about of late,—but <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> is good, and “all things,” I <hi rend="italic">know</hi>, (blessed be His Name!) shall ultimately be for my good.—</p>
         <p>3. The day after my Ordination, Mrs Colenso and myself proceeded to pack up our few things and to leave the Waimate, which, in company with Messrs. Hamlin and Chapman and Mrs. Chapman, we did on the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., and arrived at the Bay of Islands, by way of Kerikeri and Tepuna, on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. On the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. October they all left the Bay for Auckland; and on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the same month, I commenced my leave-taking journey to the Natives residing on the Coast and the shores of Wangarei Bay, and returned on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. to Paihia. During my journey I baptized 9 infants and 1 adult—a sick and dying Chief at Wangarei. Since my return to the Bay I have been employed in packing up and making arrangements for leaving for Ahuriri in Hawke’s Bay, to which place I have been stationed by the Bishop. I am now awaiting the arrival of a vessel from Auckland, which will at the same time take Mr. Hamlin and family to the Wairoa in Hawke’s Bay, where he has, also, been stationed by the Bishop.</p>
         <p>4. In a small Box, which goes by this vessel, the “Bolina,” Capt. Daldy, you will find—a Copy of the Journal of my journey to the Southern parts of this Island during the summer of 1843–4, together with a map of a portion of my route:—a copy of an Address, written and presented by the Clergy <hi rend="italic">whose names are annexed</hi> to the Bishop at the Waimate:—a Copy of the Bishop’s Circular Letter to us, referred to in par. 2 of this Letter:—3 Auckland Newspapers which contain 3 Letters published by one of the Wesleyan Missionaries in N. Zealand, and which made no small sensation among the Colonists generally.—A parcel for Sir W.J. Hooker, containing a few dried Specimens of Plants.—A small parcel for Mr. Octavius <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>Browne, containing accounts and papers relating to his deceased brother Mr. G.D. Browne.—And a small parcel from Mrs. Williams for Mrs. Heathcote.</p>
         <p>5. Since the date of my last, the Natives have been in a very disturbed state, especially in this district. You will, doubtless, have heard of John Heke (one of the principal Chiefs of Kaikohe near the Waimate,) having gone with a large party of Natives of that village and neighbourhood to Kororareka in this Bay, in June last, and cut down the British Flag, chopping up and using the staff for firewood, and breaking windows, plundering the houses and shops, and ill-treating some of the Whites. On the Governor’s hearing of this outrage, a ship was immediately chartered to Sydney for troops, whose arrival the Natives expected with the utmost <hi rend="italic">nonchalance</hi>—often declaring what they would do by them and all White residents the moment hostilities should be begun. The Troops arrived at the Bay, together with the Governor and Mr. Clarke, and every endeavor was made use of to get Heke to see the Governor, but he would not leave his village Kaikohe. A Meeting was finally held at the Waimate, when a few muskets were demanded by the Governor, as an acknowledgement of having done wrong, which were immediately brought forward and laid at his feet by some well-disposed Chiefs, when the Governor immediately returned them. All things passed off very well;—but it required little knowledge of the Native Character to discern much of dissatisfaction in the speeches of the Native Chiefs made at this and other meetings. They compared the present and prospective state of things with the past,—praised several of their old Missionaries and Mr. Busby,—and spoke ill of the new Missionaries, the Bishop, and the Government, whom they always class together. They, also, spoke much against the continual moving of their Missionaries from them to other parts of the Island,—of the alteration of the Liturgy, praying for the Queen, Queen Dowager, Prince Albert, Albert Prince of Wales, &amp; others instead of the Native Chiefs, and of many other things, both Ecclesiastical and Civil; which shew, at least, their great powers of discernment. The Governor returned without seeing of Heke; who, a few days after, rode through the Waimate, with about 150 followers, to attend a Native feast held at a <hi rend="italic">pa</hi> close by. On his return the day after, he stopped at the Waimate and wrote two Letters to the Governor, which were of such a nature that the Bishop would <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>not receive them, nor allow any one of the Mission to write one for him. At our request Heke remained until Archd. W. Williams arrived from Paihia, when he was induced to write Letters of a better description. Shortly after the Governor’s return, and towards the end of September last, a young woman, the sister of a Chief at the Kawakawa named George King, got wounded in an affray by a policeman, on which a suitable payment was demanded by the Chiefs from Lieut. Beckham the Police Magistrate, however, not being fully aware of the merits of the Case, and misled by the representations of his Interpreter, (Henry Kemp, son of Mr. Kemp,) refused to give any payment for the offence done, on which George King, with another Chief named Broughton and their united band of followers, immediately made an inroad on Capt. Wright, an old &amp; respectable Settler residing in the Bay, and took from him by violence 8 horses! Archd. H. Williams used all his influence to get the horses back, but only got grossly insulted and laughed at. During the month of October various means were used; Mr. Clarke came up again from Auckland, and, at length, six horses were restored to Capt. Wright, on the Natives being paid by Lieut. Beckham, 1 Horse, 1 Cask Tobacco, and 1 part of a Cask of ditto. Mr. Clarke had scarcely, however, returned again to Auckland, when George King with all his party visited Kororareka, plundered the shops, and the Jail of Soldier’s stores; whilst another party visited Mr. Hingston, a respectable Settler in another part of the Bay, &amp; took away 3 horses. Mr. Busby’s horses have, also, been attempted, and Archd. H. Williams’ large farming establishment at Pakaraka has been more than once threatened with a visit. Several of the Natives now declare, they are tired of the English, and wish to have either the Americans or French, or both, to be their friends; while from many of their speeches it is too plain, that both Republican Americans and French Papists, have had their share in the late commotions.—A consequence of this very unsettled state of things—the independent spirit of the Natives—and the Governor’s present, powerless situation, (together with, perhaps, a wish to abstain, if possible, from all collision with the Native Tribes,) the Governor has stated this part of the Island to be, <hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi>, without protection, and the Government Officers (it is said) are to be removed forthwith. Hence several Settlers have left, and more are now leaving: to which, perhaps, I should add, the Bishop’s removal with the Students, Scholars, &amp; Mechanics from the Waimate <hi rend="bold">[6] </hi>has not a little contributed. Those Natives, George King, Broughton and their followers, have quite thrown aside their profession of Christianity,—(it has been said, have destroyed their Books,)—and are now talking of making war on the Christian Natives in the neighbourhood of Wangarei, to seek payment for some of their relatives slain by them in battle many years ago. While, on the other hand, the more quiet and well-disposed Natives of this neighbourhood are so disturbed as to be bent upon emigrating (!) to Sunday, or to Curtis’s Island, in S. lat. 30 ͦ., or to some other uninhabited Islet of these seas; from which we with difficulty dissuade them.</p>
         <p>6. Of the many alterations and appointments you will, perhaps, have heard before this can reach you. Rev. A. Burrows has been removed from Korareka to Waimate, and Rev. W.C. Dudley is at Kororareka, <hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi>, until the Bishop ordains a Deacon for that place, which, I believe, he intends doing on Trinity Sunday next,—some young man, a Settler residing near Auckland, is the person,—when Mr. Dudley will proceed to Orere in the Thames. Rev. J. Hamlin I have already spoken of as going to Hawke’s Bay. Mr. Kemp was removed to the Waimate, (to which arrangement, I believe, he at first acceded, but afterwards declined it,) to Superintend the Schools at that place; this is now to be done by Mr. Edward Williams, Archd. H. Williams’ son. Rev. R. Davis will soon be at Kaikohe; and Rev. J. Matthews is spoken of as being about to be sent to Matamata or Opotiki, perhaps to the latter place. The Natives in connexion with us, are, from various causes, very generally dissatisfied, and what will become of my old Congregations in the villages on the Coast and about Wangarei I do not know; my heart feels for them, while I endeavor to remember them before the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>. Look on whichever side you may just now, there is little indeed, that is cheering. I dare not commit all my thoughts to paper, but (although I may not now be believed) I may yet be allowed to say, it will be well, if ere long many of the Natives do not turn to their old customs of Heathenism, or become Papists or Infidels. Ten years experience in the Mission field has taught me, that nothing short of the plain and practical preaching of the truth <hi rend="italic">as it is in Jesus</hi>, in all its <hi rend="italic">simplicity </hi>and <hi rend="italic">pureness</hi>, will be blessed by <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, either in bringing sinners to a saving knowledge of Jesus, or in keeping them humbly in the way.<hi rend="bold">[7] </hi>—The rage for proselytising, and the undue exaltation of the Sacramental elements, will, I fear, be eventually found to be the openings through which no small amount of evil will have been inflicted upon the New Zealanders. Perhaps a few years may fully display to the C.M. Society the truth of several remarks, which, from time to time, I have ventured to make in my Letters to you. I know, my dear Sir, that such a prospect as I have here scarcely outlined, is, by several among us, denied. Flattering hopes are cherished; high-coloured pictures are drawn; and Peace, peace, is cried, when there is (to me) no prospect of “Peace”. All I can now say, is,—Happy, thrice happy shall I be, to be found a false prophet: but to me the signs of the times are clear enough; coming events too often, alas! cast their shadows before.</p>
         <p>7. Before I conclude this Letter, I would, my dear Sir, venture to speak on a subject which has been long thought upon by me; and to which I am the more emboldened from a belief that you will at least give me credit for having the welfare of the New Zealanders at heart. With all due deference then, and yet in my plain way would I say,—Let it be the Society’s particular aim to fill up and strengthen her Mission <hi rend="italic">here</hi> with <hi rend="italic">evangelical </hi>preachers <hi rend="italic">from England. </hi>I will not, I dare not, make any comparisons, which are at all times invidious, but we know, alas! too well, what is meant in England by being “<hi rend="italic">educated</hi> for the Ministry”;—where the Holy office is selected and entered upon in much the same spirit as the professions of Law, Medicine, or Arms. Further, I would venture to say, my dear Sir, Hesitate about receiving sons, or sons-in-law, or relatives, or friends of Missionaries to the Heathen. If such <hi rend="italic">must </hi>be put into the Priest’s Office in New Zealand, there are other Societies than the C.M.S., and other situations than those of Missionaries. A clever moral man, or a good classic, <hi rend="italic">may</hi> (?) fill the situation of a Chaplain, who is utterly unfit for that of a Missionary to the Heathen;—such <hi rend="italic">must </hi>be <hi rend="italic">converted</hi> men; such must <hi rend="italic">know</hi> something more powerful than Baptismal Regeneration. It was remarked to me a short while ago, by a Gentleman who had resided for some time in N. Zealand, and who is a keen observer of men and manners,— “Should the C.M.S. ever relinquish the purse-strings they would cut off one of their wings;”—<hi rend="bold">[8] </hi>to which just remark I would add,—should the C.M.S. be ever induced to concede the selection of their <hi rend="italic">men</hi>, they would as certainly cut off the other. For it is possible that you may be necessitated, for Peace-sake, to concede the selection of Stations, but never give up the selection of <hi rend="italic">men</hi> to fill them. And, still keeping from comparison, I would further venture to say,—that <hi rend="italic">converted </hi>men of the lower or middle classes will, in <hi rend="italic">general</hi>, make more useful and more acceptable Missionaries than men from the higher ranks. They are better fitted to go among men of low estate, and are better able to put up with many things, which, too often, astonish and shock the finer feelings of persons educated in a higher rank of life. For there are many plain blunt and naked things, of all kinds—in words and works—which yet <hi rend="italic">are not sins</hi>, among a people emerging from the gross immoralities of Heathenism—which must not only be patiently borne with, but had sometimes better not be seen.</p>
         <p>8. A fortnight ago I received the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. edition of the Vulgate, which you so kindly sent me—and for which, my dear Sir, I am greatly obliged: I hope (D.V.) to make a good use of it hereafter. It is just the copy which I wished, containing, as it does, all Jerome’s prefaces. As Archd. W. Williams has returned to Turanga, (which he did while I was absent at Wangarei,) I cannot <hi rend="italic">now</hi> send you an authorized Indent for a large Bell and Communion Service for Ahuriri, and small Bells for the many villages, and Slates, &amp;c., for the several Schools—but I hope to do so ere long; meanwhile we must be content to use our clanging hoe, or “bent musket-barrel”!</p>
         <p>9. I shall be obliged in your paying (£4.) Four Pounds to the Secretary of the B. &amp; F. Bible Society for me, for Bibles and Testaments sold on account of the Society: I have written a Letter to him explanatory, which I enclose.</p>
         <p>10. I have been obliged (in winding up Mr. G.D. Browne’s affairs) to draw a Bill upon you for (£25.) Twentyfive Pounds: Mr. Octavius Browne had authorized me to draw upon him for £50. additional, if I required it; finding, however, that (in consequence of the conduct of Major Browne’s agent in Sydney, who refused to honour our Bills,) a Bill drawn on Mr. O. Browne would not now be cashed, and being about to leave this neighbourhood, I was necessitated to do as I have done, and have not the least doubt but that Mr. B. will retire the Bill immediately. Should, however, anything arise to hinder his doing so, please to retire the same and charge it to my <hi rend="bold">[9] </hi>account. This Sett of Bills is, also, drawn in Duplicate, “No. 14, 35 days sight, to my order, and dated, Paihia, Novr. 25/44.”—</p>
         <p>11. In one of your last Letters you speak of the Society’s wish to form a Corresponding Committee here—at Auckland. Such an Association, would, I think, be very desirable, and be of great benefit to all, if it be composed of pious <hi rend="italic">Laymen</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Such </hi>a Commee. would, in my opinion, be a very great blessing.</p>
         <p rend="end">December 2, 1844.</p>
         <p>12. I am still here awaiting the vessel’s being ready,—(or rather waiting for Mr. Hamlin to be ready, who had until the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. to do so,)—and went yesterday (Sunday, Decr.1,) as usual to the Kawakawa to hold Service. When near the village, I found the unhappy George King in the enclosure in front of his house; I went in and talked with him, and got him to go to Chapel with me; after Service I conversed with him for a long while, and I was, on the whole, pleased with his conversation. He said, his heart was very sad for his deeds; and that he feared <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> would not receive him again. I gave him, I trust, suitable advice, and recommended him to follow the examples of Peter and Zaccheus. I have now some hope that this poor wanderer will be restrained from going further in the broad way of open and notorious wickedness.</p>
         <p>13. I have, from time to time, <hi rend="italic">heard </hi>of several Books (some published by the Protestant Assocn., and some others, such as, “Ancient Xy.”, “The Bp. of Ossory’s charge”, &amp;c., &amp;c.,) having arrived here, being sent, perhaps, by the C.M.S. for the use of their Missionaries in N.Z. I have, however, never been able to obtain <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, and have only been able to borrow, for a short time, one of the Bp. of Ossory’s charges. I mention this now, that you may know the true state of the case, and that, should you send any more of such works to N.Z., and wish <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to obtain any of them, (as I think I have been in the vanguard against the Papists, and am, moreover, a subscriber to the Prot. Assn.,) you will please to cause the same to be directed to me at Ahuriri.</p>
         <p>And now, my dear Sir, I must conclude my long and prosy epistle. I trust I shall not have offended you with anything herein written. And, praying that the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> may be pleased evermore to guide us all—always, I am</p>
         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>with every respect,</p>
         <p> ever most faithfully yours</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
