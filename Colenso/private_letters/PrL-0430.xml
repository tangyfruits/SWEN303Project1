         <p rend="end">Napier, November 18, 1880.</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>I have the honour to send you herewith four Miscellaneous Papers, which were read here before our Society during this Winter Season just ended: viz.—</p>
         <p>1. On Life, by Dr. Spencer.</p>
         <p>2. On Historical Incidents, &amp;c., (little known) of the ancient E. Coast Maoris, by W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>3. On the Vegetable Food of the ancient New Zealanders before Cook’s visit;—(read in two parts), by W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>4. Contributions towards a better knowledge of the Maoris: Part II., by W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>There are also three other papers, which were likewise read, to follow; these are all very short, and comprise 1 Zoological and 2 Botanical ones.—These, together with the Abstract of Annual Proceedings,—List of Officers and Members, &amp;c., shall be sent soon.—</p>
         <p>These last mentioned three papers are for the time detained, as these have only <hi rend="italic">very recently </hi>obtained better specimens (in fruit), &amp;c., of some of the species therein presented.</p>
         <p>I have the honour to be,</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>Your mo. ob. servt.,</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso,</p>
         <p>Hony. Secretary,</p>
         <p>H.B. Ph. Institute.</p>
