         <p>My dear Mr. McLean,</p>
         <p>I cannot allow another Steamer to return to Wellington without acknowledging your note of the 15<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. inst. At the same time I am as far off as ever from being able to “make some proposal about the Lexicon.” Ever since the receipt of your note the subject has been uppermost in my mind: (indeed, I may truly say it has been so from July 23, when I received the Offl. Telegram concerning it, so that between it and Rheumatism I have had a jolly life of it! Not being able to offer, or even think of, anything that would be satisfactory and at the same time <hi rend="italic">practicable</hi>, has caused me to delay writing you.</p>
         <p>I have felt not a little vexed about what has been said in the House about it &amp; me―with no one there (apparently) to shew (or willing, or able to show,) how the whole matter really stood. <hi rend="italic">I </hi>am repeatedly blamed, and made the scape-goat for the Govt. <hi rend="italic">laches </hi>(not, however, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Govt.) Had the Govt. kept faith with me, the Work would have been very far advanced, and in a very different state to what it now is. I have since seen in the <hi rend="italic">Hansard </hi>what was said, and I find you were all wrong:―you, in saying I had received £<hi rend="italic">1180</hi>. (here is an error of nearly £<hi rend="italic">200, </hi>as the Treasury has always lumped together the payments for the Lexicon and those for the Elementary Books &amp;c., lately published: this latter being a separate affair, arranged for in ’63, when Dr. Shortland was N.M.,)—and also, in your <hi rend="italic">not </hi>saying that I had <hi rend="italic">never </hi>in any shape or form received that aid from the Government which was expressly stipulated for; and further, in your not clearly stating,—that, from the time when the Govt. broke their faith and ceased to pay me, they had no longer any other than a <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> moral claim, which they <hi rend="italic">could not press</hi>: that’s the position. At the same time I notice that <hi rend="italic">you </hi>spoke kindly of me, for which I thank you. On the <hi rend="italic">second </hi>occasion, Mr. Reader Wood was wrong altogether,—“<hi rend="italic">it ought to be stopped at once</hi>,”—I cannot comprehend. Did he not see that the Govt. had already “stopped” payment?—or, did he think I was still being paid? or, that I could, or would, continue slaving at it year after year, since March ’70, for the paltry “₤100. at completion”?</p>
         <p>Last year I had serious thoughts of getting a Select Comee. appointed to enquire into it,—so that the House may know <hi rend="italic">all </hi>about it, and justice should be done me in the matter:—and a Commee. may yet be appointed. Were printing cheaper I would have had the whole history of it, printed as a pamphlet—for the information of Members and the Public.</p>
         <p>You ask me to make some proposal: well, what I would do, if I had the means, (if, say, I had sheep, and was a monetary gainer through the late rise in wool,—whereas <hi rend="italic">I </hi>am a great <hi rend="italic">loser </hi>through this very prosperity!)—I would just hand back to the Govt. every farthing I have ever received (including for expenses &amp; outlay,) and burn all my Mss.;—or possibly sell, or give, them to France or Germany: states which value &amp; patronize literature and scholarship.—Do not think, my dear Sir, this is a <hi rend="italic">new </hi>thought;—not so: I told Mr. Ormond so, in 1870, when the Govt. cut me adrift. I feel, &amp; I have long felt, that I was a great fool to have ever entered into any such an agreement with them—devoting my whole life &amp; energies for something over ₤<hi rend="italic">200. </hi>per ann.,—and then to be repeatedly taken to task, and snubbed &amp; spurned, year after year, by persons who know nothing at all of the matter, or the Work! The fable of the dying Lion and the Ass is as nothing to it.—</p>
         <p>I will, however, write you again in a day or two, when Mr. Ormond returns, by which time I may (?) be able to think of something.</p>
         <p>You may make any use you please of this.</p>
         <p>     I am,</p>
         <p>             Yours very truly</p>
         <p>                     Wm. Colenso.</p>
