         <p rend="end">Napier,</p>
         <p rend="end">(Sunday afternoon) </p>
         <p rend="end">March 3, 1889.</p>
         <p>Mr. D.P. Balfour,</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Having a few spare minutes (and pretty well knowing I shall be very busy this week) I write a few lines to you—to thank you for your letter of 24th Feb., and to express my hopes that Mrs. Balfour is again quite well.</p>
         <p>I had seen in the Papers the Birth &amp; the Death, and while I knew the Mother would <hi rend="italic">naturally feel</hi> it, I cannot say that I was grieved at it, (in burying many infants in past years, although at <hi rend="italic">times</hi>, I have even shed a tear at their graves, I have always considered them better off,) and in this particular case of the infant being diseased, <hi rend="italic">I look on it as a great mercy &amp; one that I feel thankful for.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I am sorry to find you are in for such a large sum with Mr. Kinross, and I hope for your sake there will be a fair dividend. I have not been in town since last Monday &amp; have seen no one here, &amp; know no news.—indeed I have not <hi rend="italic">once</hi> looked into a Napier paper for all last week! They are regularly brought to me, but remain unopened.</p>
         <p>I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> visit the said “Exhibition”. I have since heard there were several nice things there. I am pretty busy with Hill’s and Hamilton’s new lot of Tongariro plants, several nice things among them, but they take up a world of time! not merely to examine them &amp; describe if <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, but in overhauling the many descriptions of similar (or, maybe, the same) plants in so many books.</p>
         <p>I called, twice, on Premier re Mao. Lexicon: this, too, may give me a world of work!—I am now writing to Wgn. about it.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Nothing yet done</hi> with our Society towards annual Meeting, Election of Officers, Report for ’88, &amp;c, &amp;c.—I am <hi rend="italic">very sorry for this.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Cannot say <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I may revisit Bush, perhaps not at all. Weather here <hi rend="italic">very</hi> dry.</p>
         <p>With kind regards, <lb/>  Yours truly,</p>
         <p>PRIVATE.</p>
         <p>In your letter you say:— “I sent for a Doctor and for Mr.Tukes. Mr. Tuke just arrived in time: we gave her the name of Grace Elizabeth, and 10 minutes after the Baptism the poor little thing left for the <hi rend="italic">Throne of Grace</hi>: where we hope she now is”.</p>
         <p>I cannot tell you how greatly—how <hi rend="italic">very strangely</hi>, these words have affected me! Day &amp; night they have been running in my mind. It is a long long time since I have heard of such a strange medley: and bearing in mind, that you are a good Scotchman &amp; a man of sound mind &amp; strong reasoning powers, I cannot help thinking that you wrote them down hastily, never once considering their real meanings, and correct inferences.</p>
         <p>I look on them as containing most erroneous, most <hi rend="italic">pernicious </hi>doctrine! Just what your brave Countrymen with John Knox at their head once drove out of Scotland. To think for a moment, that Mr. Tuke in sprinkling a few drops of water on an infant sends straight to glory!!! And, if <hi rend="italic">without </hi>the water, What then? This is the Papist<hi rend="italic"> opus operatum </hi>with a vengeance! But there is also much more behind it. To me, there is something awful in the thought of it and therefore <hi rend="italic">constrain </hi>myself <hi rend="italic">unwillingly </hi>to write. </p>
         <p>Rather than adopt such stuff I would join Mrs. Attenborrow, or <hi rend="italic">even Daniells.</hi>
