         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Jany. 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1895.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir James Hector</p>
         <p>In writing at this season (though late) I must not omit the good old hearty greetings of our forefathers—which I sincerely wish you.—</p>
         <p>At last I send you, herewith, my Botanical papers, read <hi rend="italic">partly</hi> in rough draft at our last meeting in Novr., with my promise, that clean copies should be ready <hi rend="italic">before </hi>31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. Decr.: but I did not then foresee the huge lot of writing that was so soon to fall to my lot! (10, or more, letters to our papers, some of which were long &amp; requiring research and time: you may have seen or heard of them:)—I have however worked diligently at these Papers: not yet knowing an hour’s holiday: and I may tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, my dear Sir James, that I have been stimulated to do so from a kind of — — — what? presentiment?—feeling, that these may be my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> on Botanical subjects. I have much <hi rend="italic">other </hi>work to do, &amp; <hi rend="italic">age tells</hi>; <hi rend="italic">partly. </hi>in delicate examinations &amp; microscope work my hand is unsteady, &amp; that re-acts (!) on temper, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Væ mihi</hi>!—I am however keeping well: <hi rend="italic">far better</hi> as to my old Chron. Rheumatism than I used to be, and this I have attributed to my long thorough and fearful bout with influenza 4 yrs. ago. I hope you are <hi rend="italic">quite </hi>well. Shall I ever have the pleasure of <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> you again?—</p>
         <p>           With kindest regards,</p>
         <p>           Bel. me, yrs. faithy.</p>
         <p>                   W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>P.S. Have you seen Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Legacy</hi>—the big “Index Kewensis”? vol. III lately to hand: how Hooker must <hi rend="italic">toil</hi>!</p>
