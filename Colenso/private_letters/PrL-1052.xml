         <p rend="end">Napier, N. Zealand,<lb/>June 5<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., 1898.</p>
         <p>My dear nephew William</p>
         <p>My last to you was on 14<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. March—and I have none to answer from you since.—–</p>
         <p>I am writing to you now on two particular subjects.—</p>
         <p>1.) I yesterday wrote to your Mayor Mr. Julyan on a subject I have been some time considering, and in my letter I said, I should also write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> on the same: viz. to send ₤<hi rend="italic">1000</hi> as a second donation for the benefit of <hi rend="italic">your poor</hi>: In my <hi rend="italic">first </hi>letter to him of ’95 I had said, I hoped to be able to <hi rend="italic">do this</hi>: and now that our careless, worldly &amp; pleasure loving folks have declined to subscribe towards a public Museum and Library, my conditionally promised ₤<hi rend="italic">1000</hi> is <hi rend="italic">free</hi>, and I propose to send it to Penz. I have told Mr. Julyan that <hi rend="underline italic">after</hi> I had sent the former ₤1000, &amp; it had been by him &amp; the Corpn. invested, I received a letter from an old &amp; most respected resident in Penz., saying I should have <hi rend="italic">done better</hi> with it—in the way of <hi rend="italic">larger interest</hi>, &amp;c. In my reply, I said, I had left it all to the Mayor, &amp;c., and, it was <hi rend="italic">too late</hi> now to tell me that, and so, my dear nephew I want for you to <hi rend="italic">act for me</hi> in this matter, &amp; get the <hi rend="italic">most </hi>you can on <hi rend="underline italic">good</hi> security; &amp; I have told Mr. Julyan so. And, by &amp; by, in sending the Draft I think I shall get it made payable to <hi rend="italic">you two </hi>conjointly, unless you, in replying to his, should deem it better not to do so—write freely. The said sum is in Bank here as a Fixed Deposit, on it I gain 3%, so I shall lose ₤<hi rend="italic">30</hi>. per ann.—which I can ill afford; but, on the other hand, <hi rend="italic">our Banks </hi>are <hi rend="italic">not wholly safe &amp; sure</hi>, and I have lost enough already by this Bk. of N.Z., (like you &amp; Rd. w. Batten &amp; Carne’s) besides, in my leaving it by Will our —– Govt. would demand a <hi rend="underline italic">heavy</hi> percentage as a tax!!</p>
         <p>2.) I have frequently thought of offering <hi rend="italic">you</hi> 2 painted miniatures I have of my father &amp; mother: they were taken expressly for me some 60 years ago, by Tonkin, (whom I knew well, who lived in a shop next to Vigurs, Bookseller, at the round Corner entering into Chapel Street,)—I considered them <hi rend="italic">good</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">likenesses</hi>, and only give them to you, to have and preserve &amp; hand down to <hi rend="italic">your own </hi>family—or to Rd’s., If he marries &amp; has children,—so as to be kept in our family. Perhaps you may remember your grand parents.</p>
         <p>I suppose you will have heard of me from Willie: I went inland, to Woodville 100 miles S., at end of April, returning to Napier on 26<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. May. At Woodville (the scene of my accident in ’97,) I preached on 2 Sundays, the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>Sunday <hi rend="italic">twice</hi>, Mg. &amp; Evg. reading lessons, also, &amp; assisting at H.C.,—and so, again, on 22<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. May at Waipukurau, 2 Sermons in the <hi rend="italic">one day</hi>: I am keeping well, but still deficient in walking power, that is, on hills, or uneven ground. I can walk a mile, or two, on flat smooth ground, but <hi rend="italic">dislike </hi>steps and cannot well kneel: do not in Church. I hope you &amp; yours are all well. Sarah, in her last (<hi rend="italic">for Willie</hi>) said, your Sailor son was then <hi rend="italic">at Home</hi>, and I trust <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. I must refer you to <hi rend="italic">Willie’s </hi>papers for common news.</p>
         <p>With much affection to you &amp; yours, &amp; kindest remembrances to all the family. Believe me,</p>
         <p>                                 Your affect. Uncle,     W. Colenso.</p>
         <p>Hope you recd. the book I sent you.</p>
