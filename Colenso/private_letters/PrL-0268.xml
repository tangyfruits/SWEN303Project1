         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>Octr 21  1873</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Yesterday I received a copy of your circular of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Inst., informing me of your being about to reprint the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. vol. of the “Transactions”, and requesting me to point out any errata I may have noticed in my contributions in that vol.</p>
         <p>Speaking from memory I should say, that the “errata” (Printer’s &amp; Editor’s) are very few; but what I wish particularly to know is, whether the great erratum (?) or omission of the “<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>” to the essay on the Maoris will now be printed w. this 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Edition? If so, then I would mark the proper spots where the <hi rend="italic">small</hi> reference figures to those notes should come in. Of course, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know how very much I regretted their being omitted,—however, that could not be helped. And, I suppose, you will recollect that, at your request, I made you a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> clean copy of all those “Notes” some time ago, which Ms. I hope you have both safe and at hand.</p>
         <p>Please let me know early about the printing of those Notes in this 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Edn.</p>
         <p>Hoping you are quite well—I am</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
