         <p>Hon. D. McLean</p>
         <p>My Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Although you are “te ngakakii” in business, just now,—still, I think, I may venture to write you a line when <hi rend="italic">it requires no answer</hi>.</p>
         <p>Whether it was a misunderstanding on my part I don’t know—but I fully expected you would call while here—believing, that <hi rend="italic">you yourself had fixed to do so</hi>. Therefore I staid at home, closely, after Council,—day &amp; night, thinking you would call. Perhaps you were too busy: but had I not depended on your calling, I could &amp; would have called on you: as I wished to have some talk with you about Native Matters.</p>
         <p>Last week Locke shewed copies of Parts I &amp; II of that English-Maori work of mine, which I hear is in request. Could you pass the word for me to have a copy of each part (or, <hi rend="italic">3 </hi>copies of each part)? And, by-and-bye, when you are less busy,—tell me, <hi rend="italic">whether you would wish the work to be continued.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Col. Russell, who received the Mss. from me when Native Minister,—was a means of stopping it:—and has always, I believe, opposed it,—unknowingly, perhaps.</p>
         <p>Well: I hope <hi rend="italic">you will get well through </hi>this session. Don’t be <hi rend="italic">quite </hi>surprised should you see me some day in the gallery!!</p>
         <p>I went last Thursday to see Alexander: he is very low, but still sensible, though he wanders at times. I don’t think he can recover, or will last long. His Brother has since arrived, and is now with him; at which I am glad.—I believe he will soon be a <hi rend="italic">grandfather.—</hi>
         </p>
         <p>     Believe me</p>
         <p>             My dear Sir</p>
         <p>                     Yours truly</p>
         <p>                             W. Colenso.</p>
