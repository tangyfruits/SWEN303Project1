         <p rend="end">Napier<lb/>November 26, 1870</p>
         <p>My dear Mr. Mantell</p>
         <p>Having been engaged this day in putting up our Society’s Papers for the Manager N.Z. I. who is now <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for Wgn. <hi rend="italic">and</hi> will call here tomorrow on his way thither,—I write you this. (Bearing, of course, in mind, your present duties in Leg. Council.)</p>
         <p>Among those Papers are two of mine on the <hi rend="italic">Moa</hi>, (2 <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, &amp; 1 new,)—and I would beg of you to use your influence in the N.Z.I. to get them published in the forthcoming vol. of “Transactions.” You may remember, that I wrote to you <hi rend="italic">about</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Part </hi>I long ago, and received your kind answer,—and on that I have acted—That <hi rend="italic">first </hi>part was read here <hi rend="italic">last </hi>year,—but detained for part II. to accompany it. </p>
         <p>There is also another of mine, (“Contributions &amp;c.”, no. 2,) which may particularly interest <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—there is a good deal of Maori wit and lore in it.—</p>
         <p>Unfortunately this paper <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be my <hi rend="italic">last</hi>! I did both plan &amp; hope to get on with several <hi rend="italic">of them</hi>,—but the action of the “Directors” N.Z.I. last year <hi rend="italic">re </hi>my “Ruahine Journey” papers, has completely shut me up! (as I cannot wish to be served so again). I may, however, continue to write them for <hi rend="italic">some other </hi>Co.—but ?</p>
         <p>And now a word <hi rend="italic">re </hi>this precious Property Tax Bill, Do strike out the worse than Goth-like doubly Bœotian tax on <hi rend="italic">Books, plates, drawings, specimens</hi>, &amp;c, &amp;c,—or I must knock under, &amp; that at once.</p>
         <p>             Hoping this may find you enjoying good health.</p>
         <p>                     I am,</p>
         <p>                             My dear Mr. Mantell,</p>
         <p>                                     Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>                                             Wm. Colenso.</p>
