         <p rend="end">Napier, March 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. 1882</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>Lest you may be led to think me somewhat uncourteous I write you these few lines:—for I wrote to Dr. Hector <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi>, returning the printed sheets you had kindly sent me, to go by early overland mail this morning, (as Dr. Hector had endorsed them to be “returned at once”,) and I could not get ready a line to you by the same opportunity.</p>
         <p>I have to thank you for your kindness in sending me this Catalogue of <hi rend="italic">Neuroptera</hi>, as a <hi rend="italic">loan </hi>from your Library: I will soon return it; and I thank you very much for it.—</p>
         <p>As your <hi rend="italic">big packet</hi> only arrived here on Tuesday night, 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inst., by the <hi rend="italic">overland</hi> mail,—it was the merest chance in the world that I happened to be in Napier,—for I had fully arranged to go to the woods “&amp; far away” on Monday 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.—but, at the <hi rend="italic">last moment</hi>, the news of <hi rend="italic">increasing</hi> sickness (common and general) in those parts, caused me to “hold on”, and “bide a wee”!—Had I gone, your packet must have lain here till my return—say, <hi rend="italic">after </hi>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. April. As it is however I don’t know when I shall be able to move out in that direction;—if at all this autumn.</p>
         <p>There were not many gross errors (as you will see),—but there were a few “<hi rend="italic">printer’s </hi>errors” which ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be found in <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>-work now-a-days in Wellington.—</p>
         <p>I little thought when I last wrote to you, That Dr. Hector was on board of <hi rend="italic">that same </hi>Steamer that took your letter!</p>
         <p>Our papers tell us of “15 cases having been packed at Col. Museum for exhibition at Canterbury,”—so I suppose you have been, &amp; are, <hi rend="italic">extra </hi>busy.</p>
         <p>I saw Mr. Newman in town to day.—</p>
         <p>Yours faithfully</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
