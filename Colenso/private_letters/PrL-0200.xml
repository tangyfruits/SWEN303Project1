         <p rend="end">Wellington, Septr.29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1865.</p>
         <p>Jas. Hector, Esq., M.D.<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c<lb/>Wellington.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>I have just received your note of this morning, covering an official note (no. 3024,) from the Hony. Secretary to the Dunedin Exhibition to you of the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst., and also Ms. notes, 21, 22, &amp; 29, to my Essay on “the Maori Races of N.Z.”—which notes are considered by the Commissioners to be “objectionable,” and such as “ought not to be printed.”</p>
         <p>I have again closely perused them, and, failing to discover any thing objectionable in them, I confess I scarcely know how to reply.</p>
         <p>It must be clear, that in my writing on the New Zealanders, (who have been, and are, so heavily charged with immodesty,) I wished to shew what they were – what the first navigators &amp; visitors found them to be: of course, if those notes (collected from rare and authentic works,) are to be struck out, my own opinion &amp; early knowledge of them (being contrary to the general modern estimation,) will appear still more peculiar; while by such suppression of the truth not only myself but also the N. Zealanders will not have justice done us.</p>
         <p>—Pardon me, if I say, I had thought the day of ultra-fastidiousness in scientific enquiry had well-nigh passed away.—</p>
         <p>In order, however, if possible to please all  parties, I have no objection to the striking-out of the middle part of note 21,—(beginning “the writer recollects,” and ending at “comforted,”)—also, the first part (or the whole) of note 22 (at the same time I feel such would be a suppression of the truth)—and, the term “making water,” in note 29, could perhaps be modified by some more delicate word, or euphemism,—or given in Latin!—or, if still objected to, let this note (29) be struck out altogether.</p>
         <p>Once more, and in conclusion, may I be permitted to observe—1. That, viewing the Ms. Essay and Notes as being the property of the Commissioners, they should deal with them as they please: but, if they should choose to print them with much alteration or suppression of parts, or of (necessary) notes, that I should be allowed to reprint them in full (say, at least 2 (two) years hence,) if by me desired.—2. That, if the Commissioners should on the whole prefer to decline the printing of them, I am quite willing to receive them back, leaving it entirely to them to make any allowance to me for trouble expense and loss.—</p>
         <p>Should I live to complete my large projected work on N.Z.,—statements and notes of a much more “objectionable” character than any to be found in the present Essay &amp; Notes, will, of necessity, be found in it.—</p>
         <p>Believe me<lb/>              Dear Sir<lb/>                   Yours truly<lb/>                                Wm. Colenso.</p>
      </body>
