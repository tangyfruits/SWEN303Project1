         <p rend="end">Church Mission Station, <lb/>Waitangi, N.Z., <lb/>December 4, 1852.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs, </p>
         <p>A little cutter-boat being now about to sail from Ahuriri for Wellington, allows me an opportunity of writing you a few lines, just to inform you of the present sad situation of myself &amp; <hi rend="italic">my flock</hi>. </p>
         <p>On Monday morning last, the 29th. ulto. the Rev. J. Hamlin most unexpectedly arrived here from his Station, bringing me a packet from the Bishop of New Zealand, containing his definitive judgment against me,—inhibiting me from performing any ministerial duty,—revoking his Licence,—and closing with no hopes of a reversal of his Sentence!— </p>
         <p>This unwise step,—this most harsh most hurried judgement of the Bishop’s—not only as far as regards myself (that is the <hi rend="italic">least</hi> of the matter), but as it regards my flock, whose very remaining together is now imperilled,—has been pronounced by my “spiritual father and Ordinary” in consequence of a voluntary confession which I had made to him of an error I had committed nearly 2 years ago.— </p>
         <p>My letter to the Bishop was marked “Private,” and written (as I firmly believed,) in accordance with the Exhortation in our Communion Service and the concluding sentence of the cxiii Canon of our Church,—and, above all, the copious &amp; repeated directions contained in the New Testament concerning all such sad matters.—My “spiritual father &amp; friend” has, however, not only pronounced his hasty &amp; severe judgement against me, but has also broken Confidence in giving my Letter into the hands of 5 Clergymen; all of whom, had I been present, or cognizant, I should have challenged, as being prejudiced against me. His own 3 peculiar clergymen on account of their Tractarian views; &amp; Messrs. Kissling and Burrows—the former, from my often having denounced his incessant German habit of smoking tobacco and his dwelling <hi rend="italic">in</hi> a Colonial town, while the latter, (who was formerly my intimate friend,) has, for some reason best known to himself, ceased from even noticing my Letters ever since I left the Bay of Islands. The Bishop too, as my “Judge”, has not allowed me to speak in my own defence; for, in my letter I had said, that there were many things which I could tell him, which might be urged in my favor;—these, however, he cared not to hear. His Lordship also wrote to Mr. Hamlin, to “advise me, as a friend, to leave Ahuriri immediately!” Had I received such unhappy advice I need scarcely tell you, that your flock here would have been for ever gone from, at least, the outward communion of the Church of England.— </p>
         <p>But, to return:—On recovering a little from my surprise, (I had just returned from our Chapel with a wedding party, having, the day previous, had a larger congregation than usual,)—I informed Mr. Hamlin, that I would fulfil that part of my Ordination vow &amp; <hi rend="italic">obey the Bishop</hi>, but that the consequences would rest with him. Mr. Hamlin also told me, that the Bishop had written to Archdn. Hadfield to send Mr. S. Williams here to take charge of the Station. This information was the only gleam of light afforded us. Mr. Hamlin having fulfilled his unwelcome mission, wished to return quietly in a day or two; but I insisted upon <hi rend="italic">his declaring</hi> the Bishop’s judgement to as many of my Native Teachers &amp; Christian Chiefs as I could collect to see him. To this he, at length, assented: so I exerted myself: and, though my messengers and they (the Teachers &amp; Chiefs) travelling all night, they arrived here from the nearer villages by Wednesday noon, when in the afternoon, the sad &amp; most unwelcome tidings was by Mr. Hamlin publicly made known.—</p>
         <p>I will not attempt to pourtray their state on hearing it. We fell on the ground &amp; wept together. I endeavored to pacify—1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. by example; declaring I should assent (though never never <hi rend="italic">con</hi>sent) to the Bishop’s order; and, 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. by leading them to consider the near approach of a useful minister in Mr. S. Williams. </p>
         <p>Their feeling oratory flowed till dark. To the proposal of Mr. Hamlin, to remove me hence;—they repeatedly expressed their great indignation.— “What” said they, “if Neho (myself) had died naturally wouldst thou and thy Bishop come here to remove his body? and now that he is dead (Ministerially), cut down by thee and thy Bishop, will you attempt to remove him?—No: no.—Leave his body here that we may daily look at him,—still our father, still our friend,—whom, thou sayest, we can no longer hear.”— — </p>
         <p>Fortunately Mr. Hamlin left at a <hi rend="italic">very early</hi> hour on the ensuing morning, unnoticed; or, I fear, from what I have since seen &amp; heard, he might not have got away so safely. It being the ancient &amp; superstitious custom of the New Zealanders to kill or greatly abuse the messengers of bad tidings.— </p>
         <p>Ever since the Natives have been in a state of the greatest excitement. Fresh parties are continually arriving to condole, etc., after their fashion: and it requires much tact &amp; firmness on my part, and all my belief in, &amp; submission to, Episcopacy, to keep the flock within anything like proper bounds. They have tried to induce me, at least to continue to attend to the duties of the Ministry until Mr. Williams shall arrive, but without any success on their part. I have promised to instruct <hi rend="italic">privately</hi> the Teachers and others; and have declared, that I shall always go to Church to hear &amp; pray with them. They, however, say, (and I partly believe it,) that if Mr. Williams does not come <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>, they shall all be scattered. </p>
         <p>I cannot, however, write you any more at this time. In fact, I fear I am too late for this boat, and I have to send this 7 miles to the harbour. I write you now, my dear Sirs, chiefly <hi rend="italic">to beg you, to defer answering the Bishop’s communications to you </hi>respecting me until you shall have received my explanatory letter, which (D.V.) will follow this at an early date; I hope, within a fortnight, if an opportunity should offer.</p>
         <p>I have indeed erred, erred greatly; but I dare believe, that my most gracious Lord and Master, the Bishop of Souls, hath long ago forgiven me the iniquity of my sin.</p>
         <p>Praying you to remember both me &amp; <hi rend="italic">my flock</hi> in your prayers,         I am,</p>
         <p>my dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>Yours truly though unworthily, </p>
         <p>in much affliction,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
         <p>Secretaries, <lb/>C.M.House, London.</p>
         <p>P. S. I had almost forgotten to say, that Major Straith’s <hi rend="italic">valued</hi> letter of January 31st. (for which I thank him much,) only came to hand a short time ago; having slumbered 3–4 months in Mr. Cole’s study at Wellington! I sent you a large packet of my Journal about 6 weeks ago.    W.C.</p>
