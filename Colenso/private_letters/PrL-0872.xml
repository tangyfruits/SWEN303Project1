         <p>Dear Sir James Hector,</p>
         <p>I have just received a letter from Hamilton (Dunedin), containing the enclosed clipping from “Otago Witness” of June 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>.—and I lose no time in sending it to you—though you may have seen it. If this story be true—then <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is the clue to our Bell.<note xml:id="ftn3-650" place="foot" n="650"> The clipping refers to the finding of an ancient wreck near Raglan, of what was thought to be a Javanese or Japanese ship.</note>—</p>
         <p>And, as I am writing, may I ask—If that matter I formerly mentioned to you—(<hi rend="italic">re </hi>my <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> a paper for our “Trans.” containing several strange &amp; curious matters, anecdotes, that once occurred here in the ’40’s,) has been by you &amp; the <hi rend="italic">Governors</hi> considered?—I do not care much about it myself—indeed, half of our session for ’93 is expiring, and I have already written 2 papers for them;—and if <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> it would make small difference <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>.—</p>
         <p>Hope you are keeping in good health: and with kind regards, I am,—</p>
         <p>             Yours sincerely,</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso.</p>
