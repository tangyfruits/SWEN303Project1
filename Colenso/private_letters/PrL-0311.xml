         <p>Na, e hoa, kei pouri koe ki taku tonanui ki a ratou, me titiro kite wa roa I tatari ai ahau, kei riri koe ki ahau.

         <p>Dear Karaitiana<note xml:id="ftn2-248" place="foot" n="248"> Karaitiana Takamoana , a former pupil of Colenso’s, Christian convert, powerful rangatira and MHR for Eastern Māori 1871–9. Translation by Frith Driver-Burgess.</note>
         </p>
         <p>Greetings to you two and the tribe. Here is what I have to say. In my opinion the time has passed for complaining about trials, about race time and voting time;—therefore I am writing to your younger relatives, Henare<note xml:id="ftn2-249" place="foot" n="249"> Possibly Henare Tomoana or Henare Matua</note> and the others, to bear me in mind;—and after this I will rest easy.</p>
         <p>Now, my friend, lest you be downcast at the import of my message to them, consider the long time I waited, and do not be angry at me. Te Hiana<note xml:id="ftn2-250" place="foot" n="250"> Possibly John Sheehan, (MHR 1872-1879, 1885; Minr Native Affairs 1877) who is referred to elsewhere by a Māori transliteration “Te Hiana”. While considerably younger than Colenso, both were involved on different sides of the Hawkes Bay Repudiation Movement: Sheehan was a friend of Takamoana and his lawyer in the movement, while Colenso counselled Takamoana and other chiefs that pursuing repudiation would only land him in greater debt to his lawyers.</note> and I have only just seen this,—and, as I said, we appear somewhat similar, very well, then, if not, then there’s nothing to be done, but for my lawyer, Te Rahera<note xml:id="ftn2-251" place="foot" n="251"> A Te Rahera appears, advertising his services as a lawyer in Gisborne, in advertisements of 1878. “Te Rahera” G. W. Russell, a young lawyer (and later politician), served in Gisbourne in the early 1870s.</note>, to avenge my injuries.</p>
         <p>Kara, my friend, I considered you for a long time, and considered in depth too,—your parliamentary position, your name, and also our shared area. However, I will not do this, if your younger relations are obstinate,—they will caught up by Te Rahera, and will be summonsed, and towed into the Court, it will be in the newspapers as news, and this person will elevated as famous. Now, if this comes to be, you two might say it’s the begrudging younger relative only, but it was you two who spoke ill of me.  </p>
         <p>That’s all for now, my friend Kara. Open your ears.</p>
         <p>Yours, your wise friend,</p>
         <p>Colenso.</p>
