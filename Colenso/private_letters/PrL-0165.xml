         <p>To A. Alexander, Esq., J.P.,—<lb/>  and, also,<lb/>To Thomas Lowry, Esq.<lb/>  H. Bay</p>
         <p>Dear Sir</p>
         <p>The Genl. Govt. has very recently sent me a copy of a Letter from Bp. Williams of Poverty Bay to the Hon. the Colonial Secretary, concerning myself and Waitangi. The Bishop has written in very disparaging terms respecting some of the Houses that were there; speaking of the Mission House as only “<hi rend="underline italic">a temporary</hi>
            <hi rend="italic"> Raupo building</hi>”:—of the weatherboard Store, as “a <hi rend="italic">small one</hi>”:—and of the nicely ornamented study, merely as “a small raupo building in which Mr. Colenso lived after the fire,” &amp;c. &amp;c.—Of course the whole gist of Bp. Williams’ Letter is, that I ought to receive nothing further for <hi rend="italic">such</hi> Improvements: and that, in my having received from him on the part of the C.M. Society, (at the Bay of Islands, in 1844,) the sum of ₤70.—that that sum covered all Building Expenses including Fencing (down to the present time, 18 years!)—or, at all events, I ought to receive no more.—</p>
         <p>Now, as you, Sir, were one of the very few persons now in Hawke’s Bay who saw the Mission Premises at Waitangi during the time referred tp by Bp. Williams—<hi rend="italic">i.e. </hi>from 1845 to 1853—before the Mission House there was destroyed by fire—I will be much obliged in your kindly stating your opiniojn as to those said three Buildings and fencing, for the information of the General Government.—</p>
         <p>                             I am,<lb/>                                      Dear Sir,<lb/>                          Yours truly<lb/>                (signed)        Wm. Colenso.</p>
