         <p>Napier<lb/>Novr. 26, 1879</p>
         <p>My dear Dr. von Haast,</p>
         <p>I find on enquiry, from Mr Dobson, that you really have returned to Xt.Church! I hope none the worse for your sojourn in the warmer latitudes.</p>
         <p>I was led to enquire through having recently received a telegram from Mr Gore (N.Z.I.), to forward on to Wellington our Society Papers;—and, also, on <hi rend="italic">finding that </hi>Dr. Hector was <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> from Sydney, and would call <hi rend="italic">here</hi> on his way tomorrow. Shall I see him?—</p>
         <p>I wished to let <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know, that my 2 Papers on the <hi rend="italic">Moa</hi> (all that I have written) will be sent with others tomorrow to Wellington. Now the question is, Will they publish them?—in the forthcoming vol. of “Transactions.” In my accompanying Offl. letter to the Manager, I have plainly said, that I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> agree to their being “abstracted”: I offer no objection to their being “<hi rend="italic">rejected</hi>,” that is quite within their province. And I write now hurriedly to say to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—if you have any particular friend among the “Directors” at Wellington, or any influence that way, <hi rend="italic">use it</hi>. I myself shall write to Mr Mantell. Of course, should my 2 Mao Papers be “rejected” I shall write to you again.</p>
         <p>I should like to ask a score of questions <hi rend="italic">re </hi>your Sydney visit, but as I fear you may be too busy just now, (and I have but little time to spare,) I forebear.</p>
         <p>And, with best wishes,</p>
         <p>Am, my dear Dr Von Haast</p>
         <p>Yours very truly</p>
         <p>Wm. Colenso.</p>
