      <p>Friday 2 A.M.</p>
      <p>My Dear Enys </p>
      <p>I have your note with spn of Lomaria enclosed – thanks.  In town yesterday I sought you at the Club – found you were gone inland.  I did not before know that you were staying there – had supposed you were at Riverslea.</p>
      <p>At our Council Meeting on Tuesday (full attendance), I was talked over to get a paper ready for 14th (the old old story!) this makes me desperately busy.  However, I have thought on your kind offer, &amp; have hastily put up a few seeds for Kew – which I send herewith to you – their duplicates I shall send (anon) by Mail to Dr Sir J. H. – </p>
      <p>If fine tomorrow I will go down to town, and try to see you; the weather however has again changed, &amp; so I may not have that pleasure. – </p>
      <p>If not, I wish you bon voyage, &amp; a true Cornish
 welcome at Home.</p>
      <p>Ever Yours, Sincerely (in haste) Wm Colenso</p>
