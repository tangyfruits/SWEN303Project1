         <p rend="end">Napier, April 21<hi rend="sup ">st</hi>., 1894.</p>
         <p>My dear Sir</p>
         <p>Several times of late I have been thinking of writing a few lines to you—but my time has been so fully occupied both night &amp; day, &amp; especially in letter-writing, that I have continually procrastinated. (An old correspondent of your city, in a letter a fortnight ago, reminded me of my not having answered two of his letters since Xmas.!—he was right: and in replying I told him,—“I had written in the March Quarter, just ended, 227 letters, also 81 in the month preceding; and now have 2 bundles <hi rend="underline italic">perennial</hi> of unanswered ones!) But to business.—</p>
         <p>1. To thank you for again kindly remembering me with a copy of the “Annual Report” of your Institute &amp; Museum. for ’93–’94: you have indeed <hi rend="italic">something</hi> to show under every heading—go on &amp; prosper. In looking over your List of <hi rend="italic">additional </hi>Books, given in it, I do not see the “Index Kewensis,” vols. I and II, perhaps you have a private copy. I have them (as a subscriber), and I find several of your plants mentioned therein: unfortunately for <hi rend="italic">us </hi>it does not come down later than “’85, Trans. N.Z.I.,” (which, of course, has Botl. papers only of 1884,) so that not a few of our plants must be omitted. It is, however, a wondrous work! entailing a heavy amount of <hi rend="italic">dry </hi>labour on the compilers.—</p>
         <p>2. I send you herewith, a copy of the “Annual report” of our branch Society,—a very poor production in every sense, save, that, now the Institute is out of debt—and this is something. The Secy. omitted <hi rend="italic">one </hi>of my Papers, of which, however, I have seen the <hi rend="italic">proof sheets</hi> from the Editor: but my principal paper (?) was read before the <hi rend="italic">Wgn.</hi> Society,—I being, also, a member.</p>
         <p>3. I also send you a copy of a Parliamentary Paper <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the “Maori Lexicon,” (long out of print, which I lately got reprinted a 2<hi rend="sup ">nd</hi>. time, as there has been a large demand for it, mostly, however, <hi rend="italic">out </hi>of N.Z..,) thinking you may not have seen it, and noticing in your Report a List of Papers read at your meetings,—one being, “Notes on Colenso’s Maori Dictionary, by F.D. Fenton”; when I am not aware of any such production of <hi rend="italic">mine </hi>ever having been published! True, <hi rend="italic">early </hi>incipient extracts (sent to Government per official requests, some 20 years ago, or more, were jumbled together and printed in Gazette size and form,) and I supposed <hi rend="italic">such </hi>must have supplied Mr. Fenton. If his paper should be published in the forthcoming vol. of “Transactions”, of course, I shall see it: but I remember that Atkinson’s critique on Tregear’s Maori book was refused!—</p>
         <p>4. Have you ever met with specimens of that curious and rare plant <hi rend="italic">Dactylanthus Taylori, </hi>Hook.? If not, I can furnish you with a spn., though not in so good a state as it should be, through having been sadly neglected in drying: Mr. Hill, our Inspr. of Schools, lately detected it, in high forests near East Cape.</p>
         <p>5. Hamilton has recently returned from the far-off Macquarie Islet, (not so pleasant a trip as yours to the “3-Kings,”) I hope he has done something Botanical as well as Zoological, in the way of collecting spns.</p>
         <p>6. A short time ago, in answering another (and 3<hi rend="sup ">rd</hi>.) letter from a Mr. Herbert Jones at Auckland, I referred him to <hi rend="italic">you </hi>as secy. &amp;c., of the Library. Mr. J. had wished me to write afresh something for him and his Book (?) <hi rend="italic">re </hi>the Maories; but I referred him, as above, to many scattered papers of mine in the vols. of “Transactions N.Z.I.,” &amp;c.—</p>
         <p>7. I suppose you have long ago seen a copy of my paper—“Signing Treaty of Waitangi” published by the Govt. at the Jubilee period? If <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, having still a few spare copies I can send you one.—</p>
         <p>8. You will have seen some able papers in late vols. of “Transactions” on N.Z. Malcology, by a foreigner named Suter, living at Xt.church. I have heard (more than once) that he is very badly off financially,—though Prof. Hutton has, at times, employed him, but the Museum authorities there are just the opposite of yours—poor! Could you give him a job? I think he is a good industrious scientific naturalist, and should not want here among us.—</p>
         <p>9. Yesterday I saw in <hi rend="italic">our </hi>Papers a notice of the death of Archdn. Maunsell, in which (as usual!) there is some error, viz. his arrival in 1834, and his having framed the Treaty of Waitangi,—though not residing in the Bay of Islands! Perhaps my noticing this, has stirred me up to write to you now.</p>
         <p>Well, now I think I have repaid my debt to you with Interest. I purpose, next week, once more! revisiting my dear old haunts in the Bush District where, however, I cannot do much <hi rend="italic">now. </hi>My time has been largely occupied as a kind of “emergency man” helping our Church Ministers in Ch. work in various places both in town &amp; country, and I am keeping very well. I trust you are also well; and w. kind regards, I am, Yours faithfully, </p>
         <p>                                                     W. Colenso.</p>
