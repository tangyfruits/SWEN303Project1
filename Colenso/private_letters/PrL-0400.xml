         <p>Dr. Hector,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I find your Steamer will call here tomorrow on your way back to Wellington,—but whether you may land, or I see you, is doubtful,—so I write you this.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, to welcome you back again to N.Z. after your long sojourn in Sydney (which I hope has proved an agreeable one),—and to congratulate you on your escape from foundering in that dreadful gale you experienced!—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, to say, that I have only this day finished putting up our Society’s (Read) Papers for you, having last week received a telegram from Mr. Gore in answer to my enquiry. A letter from me (just written) will accompany the packet of Mss., both of which I shall send by <hi rend="italic">your </hi>Mail.</p>
         <p>I fear you will not have much time to rest at Wellington before that you will have to come this way again <hi rend="italic">re</hi> this case in the Sup. Court; therefore I would now ask you—to consider what I have said in my official letter to you, when you read it, <hi rend="italic">re </hi>our Papers now sent.</p>
         <p>A short time back we held a Council, and a Resolution was passed to the Directors N.Z.I., asking them to petition for an <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> of the yearly sum allowed for publishing. And now we have this precious Property Tax Bill! I hope you will do all you can to have that Goth-like portion of the said Tax abolished,—<hi rend="italic">viz. the tax on Books, Drawings, Plates, Specimens, &amp;c, &amp;c.</hi>—I cannot understand it!</p>
         <p>     Hoping you are quite well, I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>             Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>                     W. Colenso</p>
         <p>I shall seek to send this on board.</p>
      </body>
   </text>
