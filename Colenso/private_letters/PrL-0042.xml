         <p rend="end">St. John’s College, Te Waimate,<lb/>October 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. 1843.</p>
         <p>1. My last Letter to you was dated May 19, 1843; since which we have not received any Communication from the Society.</p>
         <p>2. I intimated, in my last, that I expected “to go in a few days to the Waimate,” to study under the direction of the Bishop. We accordingly came hither on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of June, and (as you will have perceived) still remain. My time has been fully occupied in study; excepting about 3 weeks in August, when the Bishop kindly sent me to visit the Natives at Wangarei Bay and adjacent villages. On the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ult., an ordination was held here—when Messrs. Spencer, H Butt, and W. Bolland, were ordained Deacons. The Bishop has been pleased to defer my being admitted to Deacon’s Orders until September next; which, as it keeps me from <hi rend="italic">active</hi> usefulness, proves a severe trial to me. It grieves me much to have to eat the bread of idleness; and more to be obliged to sit still in these <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> times.—I endeavor, however, to comfort myself, with the Psalmist’s words, XXVII. 14, &amp;c. The Bishop leaves this week to visit his large Diocese, from which he will not return until March next. In consequence of which absence he has just given me a Letter of Instructions to proceed immediately (<hi rend="italic">this day</hi>) to Turanga, and thence, under the Archdeacon’s directions, to Hawke’s Bay; whence I am to return over-land, by a kind of zig-zag route among the villages of the interior, to the Waimate by the end of the Summer. The Bishop has, moreover, informed me, that, in all probability, Ahuriri in Hawke’s Bay will be the place to which I shall be ordained. I am, I trust, thankful for this journey being granted me, and for such a large and populous and distant District being prospectively allotted me as the Scene of my future labours. I can, but <hi rend="italic">feel </hi>for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Natives at Wangarei and on the Coast between that place and Cape Brett, among whom also I have hitherto laboured alone, who have not only implored me not to leave them, but have been here to the Bishop, as well as sent him letters, beseeching him not to take me from them. The Bishop, knowing pretty much of the merits of the case, will, doubtless, be guided aright in the matter; for, were it left to me to choose, I could not, I confess, do so. Had these Natives been more in number, (being only about 5, or 600,) or more destitute of Scriptural knowledge, I should then be the better able to decide.</p>
         <p>3. Nothing has been printed at your press since I last wrote, save a few chaps. in continuation of Deuteronomy and Joshua and the N.Z. Dictionary mentioned by me in my last. A short time ago, the Bishop informed me, that he had written to you respecting the Press; and, following out the idea faintly sketched in par.4. of my last communication, I think the disposal of the whole Printing establishment to him, would be well-worthy of the attentive consideration of the Parent Commee.: mainly so, from the fact, that it will henceforward be done there which shall not have received his Lordship’s <hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi>; and that in the so disposing of the Printing Establishment, our Society will be relieved of a heavy and continual expense; and, also, that in my being <hi rend="italic">entirely</hi> separated from the Press, there is no one (I speak in confidence) among them save the Archdeacon W. Williams, and the Rev. R. Maunsell, who is fully qualified—by a good knowledge of the Native Language, freedom from worldly cares, and an entire adaptation to the office of Superintendent—to undertake the arduous task of conducting same.—</p>
         <p>4. The Bishop has a little Press of his own, in which (among other things,) he, every week, prints the heads of his Native Sermon on the ensuing Sunday; these he distributes with suitable instruction among his numerous Native Teachers, for them to deliver to their hearers, and hence, ensures a similarity of teaching, and, as far as man may, erects a safeguard against heretical or novel doctrines. An admirable plan fraught with incalculable good to the Natives! I have the pleasure, and honor, and benefit of translating and preparing these skeletons for Press. It would be well if each Clergyman in the Land was to procure a little Press and a few types, and thus follow the Bishop’s good example.—I have of late been endeavouring to use it on some, but, I fear, without success. I venture, however, to enclose a little order for a small Press and a few Types, to enable me to do so;—and which, I dare to hope, the Committee will be pleased to grant me. Should, however, the state of the Society’s funds be such as not to permit of their doing so, (although the whole expense would not, I should think, be above £50. or £60.) I hope the Commee. will be pleased to make the outlay on my behalf, and to send me the whole order <hi rend="italic">without delay</hi>, kindly allowing me to pay it by instalments of £20. pr. annum, until the whole be liquidated.—</p>
         <p>5. Mr. and Mrs. Spencer sail this day with me for Tauranga, on their way to Rotorua and Taupo, at which latter place he has been stationed.</p>
         <p>6. It pleased the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> to take to himself the spirit of Mrs. Fairburn on the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. ult. For a long period previous to her death she had been a great sufferer, but was continually enabled to draw water with joy from the well of Salvation. <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> graciously fulfilled all His promises unto her, and strengthened her to meet her last foe, whom she overcame through the blood of Jesus—(her only <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>)—leaving a stedfast testimony behind her. Mrs. F. was a woman of no common mind, and had always been a <hi rend="italic">working</hi> female Missionary; and when, at last, her heart so far failed her as to preclude her moving out of doors, her chiefest delight was to assemble as many Children as she could and to instruct them in reading and in Catechisms.—Being herself a Convert from the errors of Romanism, she eagerly embraced every opportunity of exposing that master-piece of iniquity, for which work her own <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> knowledge availed her not a little. Latterly, evangelical truth was the only theme on which she delighted to dwell: her many and serious charges to me, on the faithful preaching of the same, I trust I shall never forget. In her the Natives have lost a <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>;—and in her departure the Missionaries—the <hi rend="italic">elder </hi>ones especially who for a long period had been co-adjutors with her in the Missionary field, have had another admonition from on high, that this is not our rest. May we with the warning receive such a measure of Grace as shall enable us severally to heed it!</p>
         <p>7. We are daily expecting to receive Communications from you, and from friends at home; not having heard for a long period from “our father’s land.”</p>
         <p>Praying that every needful blessing may be graciously imparted unto you in these critical times, and craving our interest in your prayers, I am,</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs,</p>
         <p>Ever most sincerely and affectionately</p>
         <p>Yours,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
