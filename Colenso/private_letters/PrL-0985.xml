         <p rend="end">Napier,<lb/>Jany. 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>., 1897.</p>
         <p>Mr. Wm. Gordon,</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>Your letter of 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Decr. reached me while in the Bush, at Dannevirke: previous to that, I had also received yours of Augt. 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. (reply to mine of July): but during the whole of the spring &amp; indeed early summer, I was laid up! <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, labouring under a very obstinate Influenza-cold with relapses—which, at times, I thought would carry me off, so that I could not get away to the Bush District until nearly the middle of December (after the General Election), and while I was there your 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. letter arrived. I had hoped to be able to glean a little Maori information for you—but I saw <hi rend="italic">none </hi>who could give me any.—</p>
         <p>I should have written to you on receipt of your second letter, but I expected a visit from an old friend (residing at the far N. among the Maoris) during the Xmas. season—and so I deferred doing so: he arrived here last week, and I found from him, that all Maoris in his neighbourhood were utterly ignorant on all such matters! and this, unfortunately, is the general case.—But I expect another visitor, pretty well versed in Maori doings, at end of this month, when I will do my best: also, on my next visit to the Maori Districts (say, about March): <hi rend="italic">I am with you wholly in your proper enquiries</hi>, and yet hope to gain a little: but <hi rend="italic">here</hi> with us we have <hi rend="italic">no aged </hi>Maoris.—</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> your drawings of carvings in your <hi rend="italic">former </hi>letter, the one named “<hi rend="italic">Roumata toroa</hi>”, is, I have no doubt, rightly named: I can well understand why it should have been so called. Also, the one named “<hi rend="italic">Hiku-ana</hi>”, = Herring-<hi rend="italic">tail</hi> (not “bones”), this, too, is clear to me. Further, these in your <hi rend="italic">recent</hi> letter, only bear the names of the Maoris who drew them: thus, “drawn (by) Puhoro”: &amp; so on.</p>
         <p>I will take care of the several names of carvings or drawings you have sent, and should you gain any <hi rend="italic">more</hi> send them to me: and if I can learn any thing <hi rend="italic">re </hi>same will write to you again.</p>
         <p>I am now very much better through my visit to the mountain woods—but extreme old age <hi rend="underline italic">tells</hi>!</p>
         <p>Though <hi rend="italic">late</hi> I heartily wish you the good old compliments of the season—</p>
         <p>And am,</p>
         <p>Yours truly,</p>
         <p>W. Colenso.</p>
