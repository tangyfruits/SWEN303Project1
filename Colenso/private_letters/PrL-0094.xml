         <p rend="end">Waitangi, Hawke’s Bay, <lb/>New Zealand, October, 30, 1850.</p>
         <p>Secretaries, <lb/>C.M. House, <lb/>London.</p>
         <p>My dear Sirs, </p>
         <p>1. My last letter was written on the 24th. of June; with which I sent a portion of my Journal down to June 8/49, and a (translated) copy of the appendix of my letter to the Archdeacon of the District.—</p>
         <p>2. I now gladly avail myself of an opportunity of transmitting you (via Wellington) another portion of my Journal down to Jany. 16/50: together with a copy of a letter from Lieut. Govr. Eyre to the disaffected natives of this place. </p>
         <p>3. I am both thankful and happy to be able to say that I am once more at peace with my late turbulent neighbours. Having had good reason for believing them to be pretty well humbled for their conduct, I called a public meeting at the Station on the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. of August, and fully made up matters with all those residing near us. Two, however of the ringleaders, (Leonard Kawepo &amp; Christian Takamoana) were absent at Manawatu, from which place they have not yet returned; and another of them,—Katene te Kori—(whose behaviour was so extremely unkind, and of whom I had heard no subsequent good report) I particularly excepted for some time longer. Those chiefs have now had a humbling which will do them good: the chief Tareha especially (who made himself so very conspicuous) having been severely visited. At the commencement of the outbreak he lost his eldest daughter, and during the winter his 2 remaining children followed her; about the same time his beloved wife was also brought down very low; and he himself is only just recovering from a dangerous illness—with which he was suddenly attacked shortly after our peace had been made. Seldom, indeed, in these latter days has the powerful arid retributive arm of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> been more clearly and speedily manifested for the deliverance and re-establishing of his servants,<note xml:id="ftn1-136" place="foot" n="136"> WC: 2 Thess. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>. 6</note> and for the rebuking of the proud thoughts of the Heathen, than on the present occasion! they themselves being judges And I could not but think, when the great chief Tareha was brought to me in a helpless state by his tribe to beg my instant aid, (and I, constantly attending upon him in Christian Talamoana’s house in the pa, which I now entered for the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>time since my being seized and carried thither as a slave, and held so tightly by him who was now stretched at my feet, was made the means under God of restoring him from the brink of the grave,<note xml:id="ftn1-137" place="foot" n="137"> WC: Matt.<hi rend="smallcaps">v</hi>. 44, 45: Rom. <hi rend="smallcaps">xii</hi>. 19–21.</note>) that a glorious opportunity was now afforded me to shew those blessed fruits of our Christian Faith, which even the veriest slave of the tribe could not but in some measure appreciate! &amp; that a great moral victory had been indeed gained! “Thanks be unto God who always causeth us triumph in Christ.”— </p>
         <p>4. I have subsequently received a very penitential note from Katene te Kori, and have also seen &amp; had some conversation with him, and cannot but believe him to be really sorry for his share in the matter. I have not yet, however, restored him deeming it advisable to allow him to remain until the Archdeacon shall pay us his annual visit in the summer and for him to admonish and raise him. This I have also told him, and he has expressed his willing assent thereto.—</p>
         <p>5. One reason I had for not making earlier peace with them was my not having heard from either the Bishop or the Lieut. Governor. On the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. of August, (just a month after we had finally adjusted matters) I received a letter from the Lieut. Governor<note xml:id="ftn1-138" place="foot" n="138"> WC: Vide, copy of Lieut.-Govr’s Letter, &amp; translation, enclosed.</note> addressed to them, which I delivered, and at their request, publicly read to them on the morning of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. September, immediately after school. A note from the Bishop in answer to my letter of the 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. February only recently reached me on the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ulto. From which I extract that portion of his Lordship’s communication relating to the matter in question,<note xml:id="ftn1-139" place="foot" n="139"> WC: Vide, extract from Bishop of New Zealand’s note, enclosed.</note> which I also enclose for your Information:—“St, John’s College, 15 July, 1850, My dear Mr. Colenso, Your letter of the 23rd. February was more than 3 months on the road, and when I received it, it was too late to take any steps to assist you in the very unpleasant affair which your letter relates. I can only hope that it has pleased God to appease the tumult, and to bring back your people into their right mind. You will have received, I do not doubt, the advice &amp; assistance of your Archdeacon, who is better able than I am to understand the course of native feeling which led to the outbreak. The occurrence is so unusual, I may say, so unexampled, in the whole history of the Mission that I am quite at a loss to account for it, especially as I have not heard anything of it from Archdeacon Williams. You may, perhaps, find an opportunity of telling Renata and Katene that this is not what I expected from them, and, that if I thought that my Scholars would often act in this manner, I should break up the school tomorrow”. </p>
         <p>6. And now, upon a calm review of the whole affair, I am constrained to acknowledge that I have been taught 2 great lessons, which I hope may be of use; namely,—that the Christian’s duty in the most perilous times is <hi rend="italic">to be still and see the salvation of the Lord;</hi> and, that I erred in seeking to an “arm of flesh”. In so doing I certainly departed widely from my usual course, and sincerely hope I shall never do the like again. It was indeed a fortunate, or, rather, a providential circumstance, that I never mentioned to the natives of my having written to the Governor, seeing my application met with such an uncommon delay, and brought from him such a mild notice. I am also right glad that I did not wait the arrival of either the Governor’s or the Bishop’s letter, as, in so doing, I should have been greatly disappointed. </p>
         <p>7. Since the date of my last I have again endeavoured to secure a suitable site for a Mission Station, and had very nearly, in fact, <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> succeeded; and had even commenced making out the necessary writings. (Having arranged to give 2 horses—or, rather, <hi rend="italic">£40</hi> wherewith to purchase them—and 6 cows, value <hi rend="italic">£60</hi> for a piece of land on the banks of the river Tukituki, situate between the villages of Ngawakatatara and Patangata, about 20 miles S.W. from the present Station, and containing, perhaps, from 2 to 300 acres; not all, however, being good land, or even useful as a Mission Station save from its natural situation.) But, just as all things were necessary, the Heathen (or worse, the semi-papist) chief, Puhara, made a demand (for the fiftieth t time) to be <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> for our having resided on this present muddy spot! considerately and respectfully stating that 2 horses and 2 cows (£60!) would be the very minimum he could take for his 10 acres of swampy flat!! Knowing the utter impossibility of our coming to terms (as I had often declared I would never, from principle, pay a needle for what had been freely given by them to the C.M.S., and for which they had received far more than a tenfold value in medicine &amp; food)—I throw up the whole affair. I was induced to offer to <hi rend="italic">purchase</hi> a suitable site for a Station,—from having already suffered so much through coming to reside on ground which is unpaid for (and which <hi rend="italic">I will never do again</hi>); &amp; from <hi rend="italic">knowing</hi> that I could not get one without paying for it;—and from the increasingly rapid occupation of all the country round about us by settlers (for sheep and cattle stations) for which they pay high rents,—£40–£60 per ann.!! And I was inclined to take that quantity (or even more if I thought I could peaceably and lawfully<note xml:id="ftn1-140" place="foot" n="140"> WC: I use this term “<hi rend="italic">lawfully</hi>” here in the sense in which it is used by the Colonial Government; and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in what I consider to be its true &amp; legitimate sense.</note> retain possession of it), on account of several Xn. natives (the jewels of this flock) of the middle and lower ranks, who, in consequence of their lands being either let or sold by their principal chiefs, and they themselves greatly persecuted, and, moreover, wishing to dwell quietly, away from the bustle &amp; turmoil of their noisy and money-loving neighbours,—much want a home. I am again, however, hedged in, and see no prospect whatever of an opening. But this, too, will doubtless be overruled for good. Perhaps before this can possibly reach you, the whole of the surrounding country will have changed lords, as the Government Land Agent is now at Manawatu buying up that district, and his arrival in this neighbourhood is by the chiefs daily expected. Should this take place, it will have a most important bearing upon the destiny of these tribes. Without doubt their temporal welfare will be (apparently) bettered, but their spiritual welfare will be greatly endangered; and, in all probability, the Faith of the majority will be scattered to the winds. </p>
         <p>8. Notwithstanding the many serious and altogether new obstacles with which our work has had to contend during the year, especially in this neighbourhood, a decided progress has been made. Thirty-three adults, principally natives of this vicinity, have been baptized; and a very nice little chapel (with glass windows, door, pulpit and reading-desk) has been erected and <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> at Te Rotoatara. Among the adults lately baptized is the dear old man, To Motu; formerly (and until very lately) the heathen Priest of Te Hapuku, and the principal “sacred” man of the district. Of the native sacerdotal rank very few indeed now remain among us,—and about half those are also candidates for baptism; while the others, though they still keep back, cease to perform their heathen rites, even when asked to do so; thus virtually consigning them “to the moles &amp; bats”. Te Motu was baptized with several others at the opening of Te Rotoatara Chapel in July last, when he received the name of Melchisedec. </p>
         <p>9. My annual Teachers’ School was held, as usual, last month; when 16 teachers &amp; monitors attended from all parts of the district. I had, for some time, almost feared that I should not be able to hold any school, in consequence of the state of the principal natives about me; but in this too, God, “always wont to give more than either we desire or deserve” graciously opened a way for us, and my teachers, though summoned very late, attended to their day. One of them, Richard Taki (an indefatigable &amp; trusty native of many years standing in the church and of service in the mission—a stranger in these parts) had just gone on foot (for the <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> time!) from his Station in Palliser Bay to Wellington (a distance there and back of a 100 heavy miles) upon matters connected with the boarded chapel building at his village. Upon his return to his hone &amp; family he immediately left them again for the Mission Station, in order to attend the Teachers’ School;—reaching this place in time but with sadly swelled and painful feet, which affliction he had to endure nearly the whole of his stay, but which never kept him from attending daily morning and evening prayers and school. By the time he got back to Palliser Bay (after the fortnights’ school), he would have travelled nearly 500 miles in 7 weeks, over such a country as this District! entirely for the purposes of the Mission. The only remuneration he got, (if such it may be called), being a few garments for himself his wife and 5 children; costing the C.M.S. the sum of £1.13.2—which, also, included his <hi rend="italic">share</hi> of payment for a twelvemonth’s steady and heavy service! Surely the pitiful pittances, of <hi rend="italic">late</hi> years doled out to your valuable native teachers in <hi rend="italic">these parts</hi>, deserve on your part a serious &amp; generous re-consideration. </p>
         <p>10. We have just received the <hi rend="italic">bare</hi> information from the Rev. R.Cole of the separation by you of Archdeacon Henry Williams from the C.M.S. Not knowing the reason which may have induced you to take such a serious step, we await rather anxiously the arrival of further information on the matter. </p>
         <p>11. I hope, ere long, to be enabled to send you another portion of my Journal. </p>
         <p>And, begging you to remember us without ceasing always in all your prayers, </p>
         <p>I am, </p>
         <p>My dear sirs, </p>
         <p>Your very obedient servant,</p>

         <p rend="center">Report for 11 Months ending Novr. 30, 1850.</p>
         <p rend="center">———————</p>
         <p>During the past 11 months I have been engaged as follows:—on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> day, in holding Divine Service twice, and in Catechizing and Teaching in the Schools.—</p>
         <p>On the week days, in attending to the Adult Male School—in Instructing and Examining the Candidates for Baptism and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s</hi> Supper—in holding Bible and Teacher’s Classes—in visiting the Sick, and dispensing Medicine—in Translating &amp; printing Tracts—in Binding Native’s Old Testaments and Prayer-books—in settling dispute, &amp;c., &amp;c.,—and in attending to the many Secular duties of the Station.—</p>
         <p>On the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of January I left the Station on a visit to the Natives of Tangoio, Petani, and Ẁarerangi; and returned on the 16<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of that month.—</p>
         <p>On the 2<hi rend="sup">nd.</hi> of February I left the Station on a visit to the Natives of Kohinurakau, Ngaẁakatatara, &amp; Patangata; and returned on the 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> following.—</p>
         <p>On the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> of March I left the Station on a general visit throughout the district; and returned on the 16<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> April.—</p>
         <p>On the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of May I left the Station on a visit to the Natives of Tangoio, Petani; and returned on the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> following.—</p>
         <p>On the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of June I again left the Station on a visit to those villages, Tangoio &amp; Petani, and returned on the 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. of that month.—</p>
         <p>On the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. July I left the Station on a visit to Waimarama, Kohinurakau, Ngaẁakatatara, Patangata, &amp; Te Rotoatara, and returned on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of that month.—</p>
         <p>On the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. of October I left the Station on a visit to Petani, Tarawera, and Tangoio; &amp; returned on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of that month.</p>
         <p>On the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of November I left the Station on a visit to all the villages lying between the Station and Cape Turnagain, <hi rend="bold">[2] </hi>and returned on the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the same month.—</p>
         <p>Total number of days absent from the Station visiting Natives, 118. (Occasional visits to Natives within one day’s journey from the Station are not herein enumerated.).</p>
         <p>The number of Baptisms performed in the District during those 11 months, is,—Men 21, Women 20, children 62;—Total, 103.</p>
         <p>The number of marriages performed, 37.</p>
         <p>The increase of Communicants, 45.</p>
         <p>The number of candidates for Baptism is still on the increase; a few more of the heathen having come over during the year.—At present I have the Names of upwards of 200 Candidates enclosed on my Books.— </p>
         <p>Three chapels have been erected during the year;—namely at Ngaawapurua, Tarawera, and Te Rotoatara. At these two last-mentioned villages there had not hitherto been any separate building for Divine Worship. The one erected at Te Rotoatara is a nearly executed and <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> building, having glazed windows, a porch, door, pulpit, &amp; reading-desk.</p>
         <p>The boarded Chapel at Wairarapa is now, I hope, very nearly finished; it would have been quite so long ago, but it was unfortunately blown down during the early part of last winter, when the outside work was nearly completed. The Natives have already paid (in Cash) £<hi rend="italic">68.13.0</hi>. to the Europeans whom they engaged to put it up; and they have £<hi rend="italic">66.0.0</hi> more to pay on its completion.—</p>
         <p>Mrs. Colenso has attended, as hitherto, to the Daily female and Infant School; but the general attendance (both in this and the Adult Male School), save on Sundays and Mondays is of a very irregular kind. Several persons have, notwithstanding, learned to read and write during the year; and not a few young Men have acquired a pretty decent <hi rend="bold">[3] </hi>knowledge of the Simple rules of Arithmetic as far as Division.</p>
         <p>The Station Congregations and Schools fell off considerably during the first six months of the year, owing to the outrageous proceedings of my principal ex-teacher Leonard (aided by some ill-disposed Chiefs,) whom I had been obliged to remove from his office. And not only so, but my person and property was daily subjected to insult and threats of violence from them, insomuch that I deemed it proper to acquaint the Lieut-Governor of the state of things about us. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord, </hi>however,<hi rend="smallcaps"> </hi>mercifully kept us during this season of trial, &amp; delivered us from our enemies and false friends in His own good time. Early in August I, believing them to be sufficiently humbled, made peace with all those residing near us; since which they have all behaved very quietly &amp; orderly towards us, and regularly attend Divine Services &amp; School as before; while our Congregations on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s </hi>day have been increased.—</p>
         <p>On the 2<hi rend="sup">nd.</hi> of September my annual Teacher’s School commenced, and continued daily until the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inclusive. Sixteen Teachers &amp; Monitors being present from all parts of the District. This year we were engaged, in the mornings, upon the following Chapters of the N. Testament, John<hi rend="smallcaps"> i</hi>, Rom. <hi rend="smallcaps">iii, iv, xiv</hi>, 1 Cor. <hi rend="smallcaps">i, ii, iii</hi>, Heb. <hi rend="smallcaps">xii</hi>, and Matt. <hi rend="smallcaps">vii</hi>, and, in the afternoons, in Arithmetic.—</p>
         <p>Throughout the year several of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> class Native Teachers have visited the more distant villages.—</p>
         <p>During my late absence (in which I went as far S. as Cape Turnagain,) a Popish Priest (who has been expelled from Te Wairoa by the Native Chiefs of that place, and who subsequently resided at Turanga,) suddenly and unexpectedly arrived here, and was instantly received by <hi rend="bold">[4] </hi>the Heathen Chief Puhara, (some of whose relatives profess to be Papists,) from whom the P. Priest immediately purchased a site for a residence, paying him £<hi rend="italic">30</hi>. for the same. The place which he has bought is about 2 miles from the Mission Station, and near to Puhara’s and Te Hapuku’s villages. From this now encamped enemy I may expect much attempted annoyance.—</p>
         <p>The state of the Natives throughout the District is much the same as when I last reported thereupon. They are certainly more careless towards spiritual things than they were; the raising of food, and the scraping of flax for sale, and the acquiring of Horses and Money occupying pretty nearly all their time and thoughts. From certain indications which present themselves on every side, I can not but believe, that a state of reaction is at hand, and that things must yet be worse before they can be better. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord’s </hi>foundation is, however, sure; He knoweth them that are His; and he will assuredly deliver them to his praise &amp; honor &amp; glory!</p>
         <p>Several persons of all ages have died during the year. A few of whom (and 2 in particular, Priscilla, the wife of Isaac Pakitara, a Monitor of Te Rotoatara, and Caleb Te Hiaro, the venerable old Chief of the sequestered village of Te Hawera,) have borne a good testimony in their last hours, and thus encouraged their otherwise desponding relatives to perservere.—</p>
         <p>I have again attempted to remove from our present unhealthy to a more eligible situation, and had very nearly succeeded in doing so; (although I should have had to pay a large sum, almost £<hi rend="italic">100</hi>, in order to enter peaceably thereupon,) when our all but completed arrangements were suddenly broken up, through the rapaciousness <hi rend="bold">[5] </hi>of the Native Chiefs. Though disappointed, and again, for a season, hedged in; I have little or no <hi rend="italic">anxiety</hi> concerning our removal.—And this principally from the fact of the Natives being so exceedingly scattered, and of their awaiting the arrival of the Government Land-Agent to sell him some large blocks of their Land; so that it is difficult (if not unadvisable) to determine at present, what spot may eventually prove to be a suitable one for a Mission Station.—As I can scarcely conceive a more monstrous and useless anomaly, than that of a Missionary residing by Choice in or near Colonial Settlements. I have long ago committed the matter of our removal to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord, </hi>and dare believe that He will guide us in this matter also.—</p>
         <p>My own and Mrs. Colenso’s health, as well as that of our 2 children, had been &amp; is much the same as mentioned in last year’s report. We have, in common with our Mission Brethren throughout the world, our daily work &amp; trials &amp; infirmities, with very much both without and within to depress us and to try our faith; but we daily prove the ready help of our covenant <hi rend="smallcaps">God,</hi> who enables us to persevere, and who is ever abundantly better towards us than all our fearful hopes could ever anticipate or desire.—</p>
