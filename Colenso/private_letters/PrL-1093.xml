      <p>Dannevirke,</p>
<p>March 20th., 1891.</p>
<p>Sir</p>
<p>I have the honour to beg your kind attention to the following.—</p>
<p>On the publication of the late John White’s “History of the Maories,” I obtained copies of the first two volumes, and I have been long waiting to see in the Government Gazette (Kahiti) the announcement of the succeeding volumes of that work.—</p>
<p>Lately, however, I have incidentally learned, that while three or four additional volumes of it have been published, these are kept  back from public sale by the Government: and, supposing this to be true, I now write to you, Sir, to grant me a copy of each volume of the said work including volume 3 onwards,—for which I shall be also prepared to pay their full price if required.—</p>
<p>I have the honour to be,</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Yr. mo. ob. servt.,</p>
<p>W. Colenso</p>
<p>The Hon.</p>
<p>The Colonial Secretary</p>
<p>Wellington.
</p>
</body>
