         <p rend="end">Paihia<lb/>July 3/40</p>
         <p>Sir</p>
         <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yr. official Letter of the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ult. in which you desire to be informed as to my willingness to chge. myself with the Paihia and Waimate Letters for distribn., &amp;c.</p>
         <p>In answer to which, I beg to state:—That I shod. be most happy at all times to do any thing in my power for the Public Benefit (consistent with my duty as a Missy. and Servt. of the C.M.S.)—and, if, Letters for Paihia and Waimate only (with the addn. of those for the Mission generally) without the Letters, &amp;c., for the Hokga. District be intended—I shod be quite willing to take on myself the chge. of recg. them. It must however be understood, that I am often, when engd. in travellg. among the Natives, necessarily from home; and, that I have not the least ambition to be gazetted as a post office keeper.</p>
         <p>                       I have the honor to be, Sir,<lb/>                               Yr. mo. ob. servt.</p>
