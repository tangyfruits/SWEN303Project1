         <p rend="end">Church Mission Station.</p>
         <p rend="end">Waitangi,</p>
         <p rend="end">Octr. 21. 1850.</p>
         <p>Sir</p>
         <p>Having just returned from visiting my northernmost villages, and understanding from some Natives that Te Hapuku and the Chiefs are gone to the Waipukurau with the intention of meeting you there: and hearing also that you have already been some time in the Manawatu District, and thinking that you may probably require a few little necessaries―such as Tea, Sugar, Bread, &amp;c.―I write this, to beg you <hi rend="italic">not </hi>to allow yourself to want any thing of that kind, and to request you without delay to send freely to us, assuring you, that we will gladly do all that we can to make your present bush life comfortable.―</p>
         <p>We do not know whether it is your intention to come on quite so far North as the Mission Station; but, should you come into our immediate neighbourhood, we must regret that, under existing circumstances we have it not in our power to offer you a residence during your stay in these parts. Let not this, however, we beg, deter you from making every application to us for whatever you may need, and which we may be able to supply―and to which―should you reach our vicinity, we shall be truly happy to add from the produce of our little dairy.</p>
         <p>       I am, Sir,</p>
         <p>               Yours very sincerely</p>
         <p>                       William Colenso</p>
      </body>
