            <p>May 18th 1883</p>
            <p>My dear Hooker</p>
            <p>I was very glad to see once more your well known &amp;
welcome handwriting, when I 
received your note of March, concerning Colenso’s certificate. I signed it at once &amp; 
forwarded it to Buller, who had not yet signed it. I shall be truly glad if Colenso is elected; he 
is one of the “Vieille Garde”. I congratulate you most heartily on the completion of the 
Genera Plantarum, a work which will remain a classical proof of your energy, [2] 
perseverance &amp; deep research (of course I speak also of Mr Bentham) &amp; to which every 
botanist has to go for information.</p>
            <p>I can now get some seeds of 
Cordyline indivisa
from Mt Herbert
(Banks Peninsula)
,
where it grows to 25
00 feet, &amp; is often covered for
weeks with snow, (at least the bottom). 
Perhaps that from
such hardy plants it will grow
. Shall I send you some?</p>
            <p>I have unfortunately very little time for scientific work. The lectures during term time 
take the greater part of my time &amp; in our holidays I [3] have to get rid of the museum work I 
had to put off.</p>
            <p>The latter has grown over my head &amp; being hard up for money I cannot afford to get 
any scientific assistance I want so very badly. We were obliged to start a School of Art from 
the Museum Trust funds (according to our deed) &amp; this has quite crippled us.</p>
            <p>However I hope for better times.</p>
            <p>Very faithfully yours,</p>
            <p>Julius von Haast</p>
            <p>Sir Jos. D Hooker FRS KCSI.</p>
