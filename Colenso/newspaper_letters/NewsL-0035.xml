            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,— Just, a word or two (with your permission) in reply to your correspondent F.C. in your last: I have not room for more. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> letter of his has fully confirmed my suspicion with regard to the <hi rend="italic">animus</hi> which incites him. Proved, by his unfair and garbled quotations from my letter, and by his building on such false premises; an excellent illustration of <hi rend="italic">suppressio veri</hi> and <hi rend="italic">suggestio falsi</hi>. F.C. says,—(as from me!) “The <hi rend="italic">ture whawhai</hi> was dated January 25th, and issued at Taranaki Feb. 22nd; the “Government account” of the matter was published July 31st, or more than 6 months after the proclamation of the war! Is not the charge of neglect on the part of the Government fully proved by Mr. Colenso’s own showing?” To which I answer, NO. For, 1st, I had stated, that, “in the <hi rend="italic">Karere Maori</hi> of July 31st Mr. McLean had himself AGAIN given a clear and distinct account of the whole affair; even to the occupying of 11 closely printed pages”:—And, 2nd, F.C. ought to have known, that the Governor had given from the very outset of the Taranaki struggle a clear account of the whole sad affair; every <hi rend="italic">Karere Maori</hi>, from the beginning of the outbreak downwards, being occupied with a perspicuous statement of the same. In the February number of that serial is given not only an account of the Governor’s visit to Taranaki, &amp;c., but also, that very valuable paper of His Excellency which contains such an able and lucid statement of his Native policy, and which I had myself the honor to bring before the notice of our Provincial Council in March last. </p>
         <p>As I view it, any further words are but wasted on such a dishonest writer as your correspondent F.C. Therefore, in taking a final leave, I would direct him to a sentence in my former reply to his 1st letter— “That a man is in common justice bound to ascertain the truth of a charge before he makes it.”</p>
         <p>				Yours &amp;c,</p>
         <p>
