            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Herald</hi> of the 20th, in speaking of the Education Rate, you say that you “republish (from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>) what is probably a <hi rend="italic">revised</hi> report” of what was said at the meeting on Monday evening; and as the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, in his paper of this morning, has not thought proper to take any notice of your statement, and as his silence might be reasonably taken as meaning assent, I write now to say that I know of no revision of the report, having not only never seen it before it was published, but also had no communication whatever with either reporter or printer. Had I seen it I should have corrected a few words—such as “Te Aute school estate being worth £5000;” what I said was—containing 5000 acres.—Yours, &amp;c., </p>
