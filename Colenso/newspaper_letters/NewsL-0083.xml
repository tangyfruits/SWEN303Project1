         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I have been rather pointedly asked to-day, by more than one,—Why I, as a member and minister of the Church of England, and as a pewholder, &amp;c., of St. John’s—why I did not attend the Church of England meeting held last night? And on thinking over what was said, I have concluded it to be a part of my duty to write a letter to you upon your report of that said meeting in your paper of this morning.</p>
         <p>First, then, I would say, for the information of the many (newly-arrived) attendants at St. John’s, that my reason for not attending at that ieeting (at which I greatly desired to be present) was this—that I am both a member and minister of the Established Church of England, and that being such (from long before St. John’s, or even Napier, was built,) I have ever consistently refused to lower myself by <hi rend="italic">again</hi> subscribing to any <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Synodical rules and regulations framed here in N.Z., and so professing to belong to a mere colonial clique or ecclesiastical sect. I openly refused to do so, in that church of St. John’s when such illegal subscription was first required, in the tine of the late Mr Wilkinson’s churchwardenship; commenting, on that occasion, on the impertinence (or, in colonial colloquial language, the “cheekiness “) of the thing,—to ask <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to do so! And, therefore, noticing the words of the advertisement in your paper calling the said meeting, (including even the obsolete A.D:, brought in at the end like a curly tithe pig’s tail!)—by which words mere boys of yesterday and of no experience, not to mention others newly arrived here (who had never helped in building the church!) would be put over my (aged) head if I attended the meeting: I restrained myself (as I have often done) and so stayed away for peace’ sake;―allowing them (to use an expressive Scotch phrase) “to gang their gait.”</p>
         <p>Second, in reading your long Report of this morning, I was—what? shall I say, surprised,—or concerned,—or distressed,—or pleased? to use any one of those words would not convey my real meaning, because there was just a little of each! Neither would my meaning be clearly conveyed in my saying,— “I was struck all of a heap!” Indeed, I have no one word handy which would quite supply my meaning, unless, perhaps, I may use the term “bitter-sweet.” <hi rend="italic">Financially</hi>, no doubt, your published Report seems to be a great success,—especially in these dull times; but even here, I regret to find, that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the accounts were not before the meeting, not having been audited! and, therefore, the action of the meeting, in strict law, (as far as law may be applied to such sectarian meetings,)—the action of the meeting was illegal in passing such accounts.—Then, as to the 160 additional <hi rend="italic">Communicants</hi> within the past year; if of these the number of boys and girls lately “confirmed,” &amp;c., and of the easily-led (or “silly”) women were also given,―then more might be known as to its true basis. For I have lived long enough to remember the old abominable <hi rend="italic">Test and Corporation</hi> (Sacramental) <hi rend="italic">Act</hi>, and its workings; and, also, to know a little of the designing and insidious outward requisitions of the pretentious High Church and Ritualist parties in our dear old Mother-Church-of-England, to put reliance on any such figures,—or, indeed, such persons. We have had energetic “Communicants” —aye, and Church-wardens, too,—here amongst us in Napier, whose room before long was found preferable to their company. But I must drop this, for the present, and turn,—</p>
         <p>Thirdly, to what seems the most surprising of all,—the Chairman making a long, piteous (<hi rend="italic">ad misericordiam</hi>) and leading speech, in the midst of the proceedings, and interrupting others (instead of quietly hearing what the Church members had to say on the matter before them), and so finally determining the votes of those present,—or, at all events, of all the younger and tamely-led members. Of course, from the fact of Mr Hovell being a very young man and consequently inexperienced, much may charitably be set down to that. Still, this, as I view it, Mr Editor, (as a mere pewholder, mind, my <hi rend="italic">lowest</hi> right,) was fourfold wrong;—1. Because, as Chairman (and such an one, too,—<hi rend="italic">interested</hi> I mean,) he had no right whatsoever to do so.—2. Because it is a great hardship (as Mr Price and others justly said,) that pew-holders (<hi rend="italic">alias</hi> ticket takers of seats for the season) with their families could not possibly all get to their pews in time; and such must ever be the case, I fear, here in our long and straggling town of Napier, with its great disparity of all official clocks and times: while, no doubt, it is as easy as winking, for Mr Hovell, living next door to the church to slip out bareheaded (even in rain) from his snug and cosy parlour.—3. Because it (viz, the throwing open the seats or pews to all hands <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the morning (or evening) prayer begins,) is against all good old established Ecclesiastical rule in England, (even where pews were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> paid for,)—there the pews or seats were thrown open,―in some, after the reading of the Psalms,―in others after the First Lesson; and such should be the rules here, being fair and suiting all parties. 4.—Because the Chairman, Mr Hovell, seems to have forgotten or mistaken his real position in the Church; viz, the Minister, or Servant, or Mouthpiece of the Church or Congregation when assembled. He plainly assumes (I would hope in ignorance,) that which the late Mr Townsend took on himself to say, when nearing the close of his stay among us, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>, that he, forsooth, was the Master, the Shepherd, and we the (silly) sheep! I happened to hear that precious Sermon of his, and I did not lose much time in calling on him and telling him of it: I did not <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> him repeat any such priestly stuff afterwards: I do not, however, say he did not do so.</p>
         <p>Further, and in conclusion, I note, that Mr Hovell signs himself “Incumbent,” and this not for the first time,—and you, too, Mr Editor, in your Report also use the term. Allow me to tell you (both) that such is wrong,—is, in fact, illegal: there are no <hi rend="italic">Incumbents</hi> in the whole District. It is a downright assumption; of course, done in ignorance of Ecclesiastical law. I may here add a story (known, I think, to some of your readers.) I remember, when connected with the General Assembly, that a petition to the higher powers was drawn up, and one young minister in orders, among others, wrote his name to it, adding (just as Mr Hovell does) Incumbent: but, on due consideration, that addition had to be carefully erased from the parchment (causing no little trouble) before the petition could be presented,―or it would not have been received.—I am, &amp;c.,</p>
