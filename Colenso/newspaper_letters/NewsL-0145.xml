         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I should like to say a little more upon this Temperance subject, although I have no time to spare for it, and you—at this busy Parliamentary season—no spare room; but I do so from the circumstance of both Mr Glover and Mr M‘Nicoll being strangers here, and from the fact (as seen in their letters which have appeared in your paper yesterday and to-day) of their confusing Teetotalism with Temperance, and so using it! I will be as brief as possible and being well-known here, together with my views on this subject, among my own people, shall not return to it again.</p>
         <p>Mr M‘Nicoll says,— “Mr Colenso closes his letter by stating that temperance people are intemperate, having ‘neither part nor lot’ in the matter of temperance.” Let me tell Mr M‘Nicoll two things:— </p>
         <p>1. That I assisted (largely, I may say, and that without pay,) in forming the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Temperance Society in New Zealand, in 1835)—probably before either Mr M‘Nicoll or Mr Glover was born—attending Public Meeting in open boat over some miles of sea; at a time when we had no Railway Carriages to go about in at ease! nor even horses and roads to use, nor churches in which to hold meetings, nor friends to encourage and receive us free of cost, nor money (<hi rend="italic">unknown</hi> then!) to gather: that I wrote the Report, &amp;c, of that meeting, and printed it with my own hand (being the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> book in English printed in N.Z.),* and that, in all probability, I am the only surviving originator and supporter of that early Temperance movement in this land. —2. That I have been an upholder of Temperance principles and a temperate man all my days albeit without Fanaticism, or (if they would rather) visionary notions and ideas, farfetched Utopian schemes, mere <hi rend="italic">ignis fatuus</hi> or Will-with-the-wisp, which can never become universal. </p>
         <p>What I mean by Temperance, is this, (the ancient, the classical, the Scriptural and the proper English definition of the word or term),—moderation, self-restraint, decorum, seemliness; to which, as I take it, all Christians as such are bound by their Baptismal pledge:—temperate <hi rend="italic">in all things</hi>,—not merely in drink, that is to say alcoholic liquors, (many teetotalers gulge tea by the pint or quart! not to mention their own peculiar <hi rend="italic">Cordials</hi>!!)—but in eating, smoking, play, dress, talking, sleep, &amp;c. To me, the intemperate man is to be found in two distinct classes, or companies, in that one regiment:—1. The drunkard, the glutton, the inveterate smoker, the immoderate in dress and vain body ornaments, in pleasures, and in idleness and frivolity, in gossip and low unprofitable talk:—and 2. the total abstainer from the good things that the Great and Good Father of all hath given to man for his use and comfort, with His blessing on man’s progressive improvement in their manufacture, and in his proper use of them. Whether Teetotaller or Vegetarian, anti-tobacconist and antivivisectionist, ascetic or fanatic of any kind,—all alike belong to this class: each with an ill-directed zeal acrimoniously (and too frequently dishonestly) seeking to bring mankind into his own narrowminded way, and looking scornfully on all the rest as being “in the broad way of destruction,” if not already “lost”! Further: as an old temperate man, I have often told some of our more conspicuous local teetotallers,— “Come out honourably, don’t skulk, or seek to gain advantages (pirate-like) under a flag that does not belong to you. Douse my honest and brave old English flag of Temperance, and run up your own partisan slim or narrow pennant of Teetotalism, and I will then honour you—as a party; aye, and help you too: but, mark! only just as I would (and have done) in administering strong Medicines, as Opium, Arsenic, Croton Oil, Corrosive Sublimate, and Strychnine, desperate cases requiring desperate remedies: never thinking that one treatment is suitable alike for all. Indeed, there have been instances in which I have recommended the unfortunates to become total abstainers. </p>
         <p>And, as “one concrete example” is worth more than a whole boat-load of talk, I have one handy: Suppose the “Harmy,” or their “Captain,” were to say to Mr M‘Nicoll— “We are the two Wesleyans; we adopt John Wesley’s early plan, and manner, and doctrines; we are Wesleyan Methodists as well as you; so——.” And what reply would the Wesleyan Minister, Mr M‘Nicoll, make? Would he say, with frankness and love,— “All right: come on brother with me”? — —Here, methinks, I might ask of Mr M‘Nicoll, (seeing he has posed in his letter as being Mr Glover’s “personal friend,” and also supported him,)— “Why not allow Mr Glover the use of his cosy and respectable Wesleyan Church in Clive-square, to deliver his lecture in tonight; and not allow his “dear personal friend” to drill away to the cold and cheerless Army Barracks, in mid-winter too, for that purpose? </p>
         <p>Both writers seem to take umbrage at my plain use of the word “hireling” for a paid itinerant Lecturer: I do not see anything wrong in this. For, 1st, it is a proper English (Anglo-Saxon) word: 2nd, Dr. Johnson, in his Dictionary, defines it, “one who serves for wages”: 3rd, it is so used in Scripture: and, 4th., also, by several of our superior British poets. And, (again, curiously enough!) in your own paper of yesterday, wherein I read of an imported Parson from England into America, being recently legally objected to as being a labourer for hire— “a contract labourer.” Will those writers give the difference between this word and “hireling”? </p>
         <p>To Mr Glover (a stranger and only a passing visitor) I would say one word. I should not have come out on this occasion had it not been for two contrary things happening together;—his statement at Waipawa (as shown in your paper) respecting compensation, which I view as dishonest; and the very opposite one (quoted by me in my letter) lately made by the President of the Church of England Temperance Society, he being also the highest legal authority in England. For, as I have long with sorrow viewed it, commercial and social dishonesty is far too rampant here already, to allow of any thing or matter to be spoken of publicly and taught, that might tend to increase it. As another “concrete example,”—look at the shameful number of bankrupts and insolvents from all ranks, ever increasing among us! And here I may also fully adduce the public testimony of the highest Church authority in England, the Archbishop of Canterbury, lately given by him at his opening the Public Hall for four working-men’s Clubs at Bethnal Green, London; his Grace said,— “The two real evils of Bethnal Green were Drunkenness and early reckless marriages. Drunkenness was an offence against all mankind, and early reckless marriages were offences almost as great.... Self-restraint was the road which governed both kinds of intemperance.... There were no royal roads to either leisure or means. There was only one way by which men could obtain a fair share of God’s good things, and that was by the road of diligence, industry, and thrift.”</p>
         <p>Mr Glover particularly calls my attention to the utterances of “the most learned man living, Mr Gladstone,” and to “100,000 working-men meeting in Hyde Park,” &amp;c. Now, as to the first, Mr Gladstone: for many years I was a consistent supporter of him, but now (with honest John Bright) I have been obliged to leave him—and that for his modern fanatical (visionary Utopian) schemes or speeches, which contain the utter ruin of my Native land! and all done to please his low allies, enemies to British rule. I know of no more melancholy modern instance of the great debasement prostitution and loss of talent and learning than in this one of Mr Gladstone; when considering it, in conjunction with his early and long and arduous career, I am often reminded of Milton’s Satan in his Paradise Lost. </p>
         <p>As to the second, the meeting of 100,000 men in Hyde Park (or in Trafalgar Square, or in scores of places in unhappy Ireland,)—what of that? Perhaps Mr Glover may believe in the old misused saying, <hi rend="italic">Vox populi, vox Dei</hi>, (the voice of the people is the voice of God,)—that the cry of the many—the idle the discontented the squanderer the loafer,—whether “Hosanna!” or “Crucify him!” must carry the day; forgetting, apparently, that as the wind blows the leaves are directed. I, however, have lived long enough to see the true value of all that; rather with the Duke in Shakespeare I would say—</p>
         <p> —— “I love the people. 	<lb/>But do not like to stage me to their eyes; 	<lb/>Though it do well, I do not relish well 	<lb/>Their loud applause, and avest vehement; 	<lb/>Nor do I think the man of safe discretion, 	<lb/>That does affect it.”—	<lb/>  (“Measure for Measure.”)</p>
         <p>				I am, &amp;c, 		<hi rend="smallcaps">William </hi>

         <p> Napier, June 27, 1888.</p>
         <p>* Note.—This curiosity Mr M‘Nicoll or Mr Glover may see, if they choose to call on me. </p>
         <p>† Note.—Greetings. </p>
