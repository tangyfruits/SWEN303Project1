         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I have twice read the short letter of “F.R.H.S.” in your paper of this morning; and the above well-known old and plain motto is just my conclusion upon it: although, I confess, I had nearly gone a step further, and adopted instead, that of the mountain in labor and the <hi rend="italic">ridiculous mouse</hi>!—as being still more suitable.</p>
         <p>But who is it, in particular, that “F.B.H.S.” labors to “show up,” or to “let down?” Is it you, Mr Editor, for your blundering want of botanical knowledge? (such being, as he says, “above or below your comprehension!”). Or is it the kind-hearted and liberal Mr Tiffen? or his obliging hard-working gardener?—or the judges at the late Horticultural Exhibition? or the committee of the young (“newly-fledged”) society? Not knowing the anonymous writer, it is hard for me to say who it is that he seems to have such a “down upon!” Possibly it is the whole lot of you mentioned above. Be this as it may, two things seem pretty clear:—1. that he is no true “Botanist,”—no lover of flowers for their own sake; and—2, no real well-wisher to our young Horticultural Society, and to the many exhibitors and zealous coworkers at the late show. </p>
         <p>So much for the <hi rend="italic">animus</hi> (or feelings and aim) of “F.R.H.S.” Now, then, for his big-little show of botanical learning! </p>
         <p>1. As to the correct generic name of the lovely prize plant shown, <hi rend="italic">Fittonia ———</hi>; he says, that this is not its proper name, but that it is <hi rend="italic">Gymnostachyum</hi> ———–. I will, however, venture to tell him that I think he is wrong in so saying; for I have Veitch’s catalogue before me, in which, while <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the names of <hi rend="italic">Gymnostachyium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fittonia</hi> are entered in it as belonging to <hi rend="italic">one</hi> plant (the former name merely given as indicating an error,) we are informed, that for <hi rend="italic">Gymnostachyium</hi> we must look to <hi rend="italic">Fittonia</hi>. </p>
         <p>2. As to his correction of a mere common error of the press—and that, too, a single letter! and one which by its omission, makes no difference whatever in the reading—either of grammar or meaning. [Sometimes, however, both these occur, through the want, or addition, of a single letter, and then it is awkward.] “F.R.H.S.” corrects your “<hi rend="italic">gracilium</hi>” to “<hi rend="italic">gracilimum</hi>,” and takes you to task for so blunderingly and ignorantly leaving out the first <hi rend="italic">m</hi>;—but he himself has, in his attempt at correcting you, done the same, or worse, himself, for he has omitted an <hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the word should be <hi rend="italic">gracillimum</hi>. Now were I inclined to follow “F.R.H.S.’s” example, and to carp at a wrong letter and to charge it home to him, I might notice his (or your) having here in this very sentence—intend<hi rend="italic">i</hi>d for intended. </p>
         <p>3. Again he pitches into you for another mere typographical error; one, also, that (as before) causes no difference in either the grammar or meaning,—that is, it cannot though altered be taken for another word. “F.R.H.S.” corrects your (“<hi rend="italic">rubonervia</hi>” to “<hi rend="italic">rubronerva</hi>;” but should it not have correctly been <hi rend="italic">rubrinervis</hi>?—(“This to thy right eye, Philip!”) </p>
         <p>And now Mr “F.H.R.S.,” I take my leave of you; ta, ta! Don’t jib, and be sulky. And please remember, that if you should be tempted by Mephistopheles (or something nearer) to come out again after this fashion of yours against our “newly-fledged” Horticultural Society, (for it is not fair to ill-use a wee toddling bairnie,) remember that this Old Man is here on the watch;—and so you had better think twice, and perhaps give him a wide berth.—I am, &amp;c, </p>

         <p> Napier, March 12th, 1883.</p>
         <p>P.S.—<hi rend="italic">Tuesday Morning</hi>, 13th.—I had written my letter late last night; and now I find in your paper of this morning that Mr Tiffen had very properly written a letter in reply to “F.R.H.S.” Of course, had I known of his going to do so I should not have troubled you, but as there are a few extra points in mine not touched on by Mr Tiffen, I shall still send it to you.—W.C. </p>
