        <hi rend="italic">Waipawa Mail</hi> 15 January</hi>
        <note xml:id="ftn40" place="foot" n="40"> This letter was reported almost in full by the <hi rend="italic">Poverty Bay Herald</hi>, whose Editor wrote, “Mr. Colenso's communication… is replete with sound common sense as well as generous sentiment.” —<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi></note>

      <p>— “The rope followeth the bucket.”<lb/> — Ancient Eastern proverb.</p>
      <p>
      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—The last dread sentence of the law having been fully carried out on the Maori criminal Tuhiata, I have been expecting to see in one or more of our papers some suitable remarks upon this sad strange case; none, however caught my eye. I have, therefore, determined that I would submit a few which have occurred to me for the consideration of your readers, hoping that I may thereby be the means of provoking or stirring up thought.</p>
      <p>And here I would anticipate and meet a question, which some one may be inclined to put,—Why do I undertake this peculiar duty? and my answer will be,—l. Because of my having dwelt so long in N.Z. and among the Maoris (now nearly half a century), and because of the strangeness of such a crime among them:—2. Because of my having had to attend criminals under sentence of death, both in the condemned cell and on the scaffold:—3. Because I am so well acquainted with the circumstances attending the capture by the Maoris, at that very spot where this murder was committed, of the first white woman who was ever in those parts of N.Z. many years before N.Z. became colonised. (This story, which is highly interesting, I hope to write an account of for your next week’s paper.)<note xml:id="ftn41" place="foot" n="41"> He did so: see below—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
      </note> I trust these reasons may suffice.</p>
      <p>Æsop’s Fables, which we read with delight when young (whether in their original Greek or modern English dress), always carried a moral with them; and surely a fitting moral, or reflection, or something of that kind,—something useful, something beneficial, to ourselves, and the rising generation,—may be fairly drawn from this recent shocking affair which, barely a month ago, stirred all N.Z. from the North Cape to Stewart’s Island.</p>
      <p>At that time, however, and for some time after (down to, I may say, the period of Tuhiata’s execution), there was no lack of extravagant and exaggerated, and even indecent language, respecting both the unhappy Maori and his deed; mostly, I believe, the productions of those mischievious and misleading “Special Correspondents,” who both take, and are allowed, far too much liberty; one sentence only as a sample I have need to quote to bear me out, and that shall be from your own paper of December 8th,—where your “correspondent,” writing from Auckland, says,— “The murder of Miss Dobie, a deed that has no parallel in the history of all that is diabolical and infernal,” &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
      <p>This I altogether deny; far worse murders, I am sorry to say. (if their horrid attendant circumstances can make them so,) take place continually at home in Great Britain,—to say nothing of Ireland! Every monthly mail to us teems with such. In the very last English paper I received, (dated November 2,) were accounts of two, or even three, dreadful murders, which had then just taken place; one, in Kent,—a double murder of an aged couple named Ellis, who were singly decoyed by night from their quiet home by an ex-policeman named Waller, (formerly of the Metropolitan Police force), and brutally murdered on the highway! they, too, being on friendly terms with him.</p>
      <p>To deal plainly reasonably and truthfully with such a case as this—the late N.Z. murder, is something like the under- taking of a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination,—unpleasant, aye revolting; yet both necessary and beneficial. Therefore, in speaking truthfully of the sad deed itself, I cannot but briefly say, that it might have been very much worse; that is, attended by more dreadful and harrowing circumstances this must be allowed: let this suffice.</p>
      <p>Of course, all your readers are pretty well acquainted with all that has been stated in the several Courts of Law respecting this murder. Very little indeed has there been brought forward of a clear kind, save the open admission by Tuhiata in a half-a-dozen words at the close of the first examination of his having done the deed,—his own subsequent statement before some of the Constabulary party respecting it, and, also his short letter to the Governor the day before his death. I (and no doubt many others) have regretted that the prisoner was not allowed to say what he greatly wished to say at the Coroner’s inquest, and also to speak on the scaffold at the time of his execution, when he again wished to do so,—but was so ungraciously prevented by Archdeacon Stock! I have never before heard of any poor fellow (in modern times) being denied,—roughly and rudely denied, too! as on this occasion,—that poor, that last consolation. Such, indeed, was lately granted to the unhappy Chinaman who was executed at Dunedin,—who was even asked to speak! I could say a good deal on this head, but, for the present, I refrain.</p>
      <p>The Wellington correspondent of the “Hawke’s Bay Herald,” (not a “Special,”) who, it appears, was present at the trial, thus writes of the prisoner:— “The demeanour of Tuhiata throughout the long trial as been a standing source of wonder to all beholders. He is a fine strapping young Maori, and for a native may be considered good-looking. Certainly there is nothing about his face that would stamp him as such a ferocious criminal as his actions have proved him to be, his countenance having a pleasing and good- tempered aspect about it,” He also says, that Tuhiata received his sentence composedly; and in a smiling manner, (though heavily-ironed) left the Court. And just so, it seems, he showed himself on the fatal scaffold,—allowing for the Reporter’s colouring, (I quote from the “N.Z. Mail” of January 1, 1881,)— “The governor of the gaol entered the condemned cell and brought out Tuhiata with his arms pinioned at the elbows with a strap. The Governor of the gaol led the way; Tuhiata walked steadily along the passage with an easy lounging stride, and stolid unconcerned face: mounted the steps, and, directed by the hangman, placed himself on the very centre of the drop.” Of course, in addition to all this, (which, from the accompanying tenor of those communications, with others, seems to have been unwillingly conceded,) there are the repeated charges of “callousness,” of “obduracy,” of “recklessness,” of “unconcern,” of “the habit of shedding blood,”—with other like statements which, I venture to think, <hi rend="italic">may</hi> not be true here.</p>
      <p>Why? because that this poor fellow had already done all that lay in his power towards atoning for his foul offence. He had early acknowledged his having done the deed;—that it was also a great crime—that he was willing to die for it;—and that he, there and then, offered himself to be put to death immediately, in any way the justly offended Europeans assembled should choose. And all this, mind, without attempting to say one word in extenuation! Now this, as I take it, was the grand secret of Tuhiatas subsequent, quiet pleasing peaceful appearance, behaviour and attitude, throughout the whole of his remaining days, which were (I regret to know) unnecessarily days of torture. What more could any poor erring sinful man possibly do?</p>
      <p>Tuhiata did, as I have often known Maoris to do in the olden time, (before their too common acquaintance with the “superior race” and “the blessings? of civilisation”!)—he acted immediately on the truthful promptings of his own conscience; he told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, regardless of the consequences; and having done so he received that internal support which always surely follows such a confession, and which never forsook him. He realised (it may be in <hi rend="italic">another</hi> way—far out of our thoughts) what we all profess to believe, that “if we confess our sins God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,” and this confession and forgiveness are described, by one who had experienced both, as being simultaneous and always united, (<hi rend="italic">Psalm</hi> 32.5) one cannot be without the other. He took the great Father of all on His internal teaching at His word; he lived thus his few remaining days without once faltering,—without once complaining of his many discomforts, bearing up manfully under them all; and he died properly and manly as a poor sinner should die,—having openly confessed his great sin, and acknowledged the justice of his sentence. What more could he do? What more could the very best among us do, if, unfortunately under similar sad circumstances, placed in his situation?</p>
      <p>No doubt there are some among us who would have very much preferred his (apparently) pious listening to the exhortations (whatever they were) of those Ministers who visited him,—his making large “Christian” professions,—and his having been Baptized, &amp;c., &amp;c. I, however, for one, rejoice and feel thankful that he did not relinquish the one firm hold of the right which he had taken, and understood and proved. No doubt there are also others, who would have been greatly pleased had he lived and died in continual dread and terror,—even to the behaving unseemly in his last moments, and dying struggling and howling like a dog! There <hi rend="italic">are such</hi>, I know; to them I have nothing to say; I leave such creatures to the enjoyment of their own charitable thoughts now,—and to the boat and comforts of “the ferryman Vain-hope,” including his modern crew of 8-bells-celebrants, hereafter !—as honest John Bunyan hath it.</p>
      <p>And here I would fain ask a question, or two. How would any of our countrymen—of the “superior” civilised race— generally have acted, if so overtaken with such a heavy crime; would they—could they—have acted as manly a Part as Tuhiata did? and have so consistently kept it up from the beginning to the close? —I fear not: as a rule, I scarcely remember an instance. Further: I would ask, what shall we think of that white man who sold Tuhiata the bottle of brandy on the morning of that sad deed?——and which, no doubt, was the great incentive to this robbery,—or, rather, to his attempt at extorting money from his unoffending victim, which led on to the murder? He may stand clear from human laws and convictions; but can he possibly stand clear in the sight of his own conscience?</p>
      <p>If so, then, I pity him and would rather (of the two) the self-accusing conscience of the Maori, Tuhiata. I firmly believe, that this great and fearful crime of murder,—so wholly unprecedented and contrary to all of our long and ample experience here among the Maoris of N.Z.,—would never have been committed but for their having first become so wretchedly demoralised by the boasting Christian Europeans!</p>
      <p>I should much like to pursue this subject farther, but I have already trespassed too largely on the columns of your paper.</p>
      <p>I would, however, also, say a few words with reference to the unfortunate Miss Dobie. And this I do, because you, Sir, reside among our Maori people, and your paper is read by scores of European settlers, who are living either near to, or among them ; and I write this portion of my letter particularly for the benefit of the young women, daughters and sisters of our settlers, and their young female visitors. 1. Don’t go strolling <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> into lonely unfrequented spots, to gather Ferns, or to take Sketches of forest-trees or old pas or picturesque scenes; better by far repress all such curiosity, than go to such places without companions. 2. Should you, unfortunately, happen at any time when alone, to have your money, watch, &amp;c., &amp;c., rudely demanded from you by a Maori, (or, more likely, by a travelling “loafing” European,) and you have to give it; hand it over quietly, without any threat or remark. Rely upon it, our police will soon do you justice. 3. Should you, unfortunately, at any tune when travelling, or when alone in “the Bush” or the country, be ill-used by any fellow, and hurt, and left for dead; just quietly endeavour to continue still, repressing your feelings, &amp;c., (as you would if assaulted by a wild cow, or a bear,) until the wretch shall have gone clear off. By bearing in mind and attending to such little simple prudent rules as these, (just like as when a fire breaks out in a house,) life may he preserved, and great crime prevented.—I am, &amp;c.,</p>
      <p>WILLIAM COLENSO.</p>
