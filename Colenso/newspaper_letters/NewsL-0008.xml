        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I had sharpened my pen to fulfil my promise, and so give you a 2nd letter on Fruit Trees; but your paper of the 17th inst. contains such an amusing extract from the Wellington “<hi rend="italic">Independent</hi>,” that my thoughts are turned another way. I cannot help thinking, that a man who dabbles in politics is likely to have both a hot berth and full hands; he may well enough be compared to a soldier on the field; or, better, perhaps, to a London fireman on a January night—roasting before, wet and freezing behind, with a momentary expectation of explosion by powder! Very comfortable, certainly; but, <hi rend="italic">murus æneus conscientia sana.</hi>
        <hi rend="italic">
          <note xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" n="5">A sound conscience is a wall of brass—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
          </note>
      </hi> Although I have said, your extract is the ground of my present letter, I am well aware of the <hi rend="italic">sobriquet</hi> by which the paper whence you had it is commonly known— “the lying Independent.” I, however, would not so term it, but rather call it <hi rend="italic">unfortunate</hi>. And this is, in great measure, owing to its clever editor (clever, mind; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> talented; and there is a vast difference between the two, although, alas! too often the former is mistaken for the latter—the pinchbeck for the gold); for clever men dash at their work with the swiftness of swallows, and rarely care to refer to any authority—or, indeed, to what they may have already written on the same subject—hence they are continually making mistakes, and hence they have to bear the grosser term as a necessary consequence.—</p>
      <p>We are oracularly told, Sir, that “FitzGerald and Gollan have fulfulled their mission, but not to the satisfaction of their constituents.” Their constituents, however, know the contrary; and they also believe, that the term “jesuitical” (if at all proper here,) is far more in place applied to the conduct of the members of the late Provincial Executive Government—from the General Election 9 months ago down to their very recent sad discomfiture before Judge Gresson! No doubt the Pythian of Cook’s Straits will find some way of evading its own sentence—or, rather, sentences, seeing that the above is followed by another equally truthful:— “From the hills of Castle Point to the plains of Ahuriri, not more than three or four votes will be polled for St. Hill.” But what is the recorded fact? The fact, too, be it remembered, after all the long and active and “gallant” dragooning, both light and heavy; for we are triumphantly told, that, “Russell, Newman, Ormond and their gallant compeers sweep the whole district round”! Why the plain fact is, that those puissant champions of Dr. Featherston gained, <hi rend="italic">at their head-quarters</hi>, only ONE solitary vote in excess of St. Hill! or, “from the hills of Castle Point to (the entrance of) the plains of Ahuriri,” <hi rend="italic">two</hi> votes <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than St. Hill!! “So much for the inland country.” And then the Oracle further says, “Joseph Rhodes... has raised Featherston’s banner, and rallied round him a host of supporters for the red white and blue;.... and thanks to him, Charlton, and others, the St. Hillites will find themselves sorely discomfited.” But, I again ask, what is the recorded fact? “Why, first, that at Joseph Rhodes’ own township and residence <hi rend="italic">St. Hill had a majority of five</hi>! maugre the “energy and thorough English pluck,” the “host of supporters,” the glorious (but <hi rend="italic">sham</hi>) republican “banner” of “red white and blue,” and the dreadful “bomb” which that doughty Wellington-of-thc-age sent into “the ranks of the enemy”! And, secondly, that, notwithstanding “him, and Charlton, and others, (whose <hi rend="italic">labors</hi> I have already noticed,) the Hawke’s Bay, or Coast, majority in favour of Dr. Featherston was only <hi rend="italic">four</hi>! While the gross total of votes recorded in his favour, throughout the whole of the Hawke’s Bay District, only gives him TWO ahead of his opponent St. Hill!! 62 to 60.—May Dr. Featherston, like a wise general, <hi rend="italic">look and learn</hi>. </p>
      <p>Already it is known <hi rend="italic">how</hi> some of those votes were obtained; and had I but a friendly Asmodeus at hand (like him in <hi rend="italic">le Diable Boileux</hi>,) to shew the internal workings—what a revelation there would be! “What an amount of influence of various kinds natures and degrees arrayed against St. Hill! All, or most of which, in a truly free state of genuine and virtuous Britons, ought not for a moment to exist. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, (an Asmodeus would point out) some who were distantly related to Dr. Featherston—<hi rend="italic">there</hi>, some who were related to his friends; <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, would be seen some who had “snug berths” and who wished to keep them—<hi rend="italic">there</hi>, some who, having Government Offices, had heard of Dr. Featherston’s statement, of their not being half-paid, and therefore looked for an increase of wages; <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, would be seen the owners of drays and holders of ferries, who, to please their masters the runholders, must “follow sort”—<hi rend="italic">there</hi>, would be noticed those whose near relations are Government Servants or fortunate contractors at Wellington; <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, would appear a queer animal, hight <hi rend="italic">Meridarpax</hi>*—<hi rend="italic">there</hi>, would be seen another, <hi rend="italic">Hypsiboas</hi>§ named, who, when pretty nearly overwhelmed in the slough of care, instead of praying to Hercules (or Plutus), prayed to <hi rend="italic">Lithoptilon</hi> the would-be-god of Cook’s Straits, and was heard; <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, would be seen some of the new genera of bipeds, (as recently classed by the profound naturalist Richmond,) <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> “flat fish and flies”—<hi rend="italic">there</hi>, would be discovered one who “dreamed all night and thought all day” about his getting the situation of Neptune’s vice-gerent,†  to look after those wicked<hi rend="italic">Sea Serpents</hi>, and Mermaids (with Christian names), and other marine creatures as <hi rend="italic">Petrels</hi>, &amp;c, which lawlessly infest the Ahuriri waters, and to bring them to their bearings, for a good round annual sum out of the public purse:—but, Mr. Editor, I must stop. All those (with the exception, perhaps, of the newly classed and queer animals,) would have sided <hi rend="italic">against</hi> Dr. Fcatherston, or rather, against his newly-adopted hideous <hi rend="italic">principle</hi>, had it not been for those various influences above alluded to; and those of them who voted for him, or rather it, shut their eyes to the truth, that in doing so they voted against liberty and the rights of man! in defence of which some of their forefathers had bled—degenerate sons of able sires!—</p>
      <p>Yes, Sir, and what is still more astonishing is the fact, that some of those very persons really believe that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are imbued with the true love of liberty and the rights of man, of candour and truth! Some of them are actually readers and admirers of the “<hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>”! hence they verily believe they are becoming mentally enlightened and enfranchised, and far wiser than their fathers; and yet they vote for one man to oppose the chosen representatives of the people! What a paradox!! But, Sir, I am still more moved and grieved when I see Scotia’s sons so acting. Bards of ancient days, and History both mediæval and modern, all speak of Scotland as being pre-eminently the Land of Freedom.—</p>
      <p>— “The hills of the north,     <lb/>The land of blue mountains, the birth-place of worth; Those mountains where Freedom has fixed her abode, Those wide-spreading glens where no slave ever trod, Where blooms the red heather and thistle so green.”—</p>
      <p>Scots! whose relatives and countrymen are even now engaged in erecting a monument to <hi rend="italic">Wallace</hi>: Scots! whose <hi rend="italic">Knox</hi> ne’er feared the face of man: Scots! whose <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> (though but a poor exciseman half-starving on his £70 per ann., was ever above a bribe,)—whose Burns had taught them—</p>
      <p>“A king can make a belted knight,      <lb/>  A marquis, duke, and a’ that;    <lb/>An honest man’s above his might,!  <lb/>  For a’ that, and a’ that:”—</p>
      <p>And whose <hi rend="italic">Free</hi> Church (in our day) hath shewn what <hi rend="italic">true</hi> Scotchmen are composed of, and what they can do rather than sacrifice a truthful principle—leave their warm manse and their stipends and their homes, for the wild heather and the hill-side and the snow. Oh ye Scotchmen, who voted for Dr. Featherston, I am sorry for ye: sure I am that ye wonderfully differ from those revered worthies of your Father-land: sure I am, that none of ye should ever again attempt to sing, “<hi rend="italic">Scots wha hae</hi>,” or “<hi rend="italic">Auld lang syne</hi>.” Ye should not ha’ forgotten, that, in the honest pursuit of truth, ye can shut your eyes to no real facts or phenomena. I, an old settler, can not but lament the obliquity of your moral vision. </p>
      <p>And then again the oracle declares, that “Gollan sits at “Waipukurau like a pelican in the wilderness.” It is true that he <hi rend="italic">sat</hi>, while the others “swept the whole district,” vote hunting. Gollan sat, and FitzGerald sat, and other influential friends to the cause of Reform sat, and I also sat; and we did this because it was the trial <hi rend="italic">principle</hi>; not merely which of two men should be Superintendent. And now let any impartial person contrast the two parties—both as to their exertions <hi rend="italic">before</hi> and <hi rend="italic">at</hi> the election and the success of each. But “Gollan” is sneeringly said to “sit <hi rend="italic">like</hi> a pelican in the wilderness.” Good. Be it so. I accept it. The clever editor forgot all about the “pelican,” and, owing to his overmuch cleverness, has spoken inconsequently (that I say not profanely), being tempted by the itching of a finger-ends sounding phraseology. He ought to have known how highly the ancients esteemed the pelican, and how modern naturalists speak of her. The ancients believed that she fed her young with her own blood, which she obtained by wounding her breast; hence they viewed her as the emblem of constancy affection and devotion. Hence, too, in later ages, the <hi rend="italic">pelican</hi> became one of those honourable birds adopted in heraldry, and a pelican crest is a highly honourable one. Modern naturalists have discovered that the pelican has not only certain qualities in common with many other birds—<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the carrying an ample supply of food a very long distance to their young, their <hi rend="italic">social</hi> habits, their peaceful demeanour towards other birds, and their longevity,—but, that in one good amiable and rare quality they are unique, viz. they will feed an injured bird of their species; hence the American Indians break the wing of a pelican and tie it up, in order to get a supply of fish. So that “Gollan” may very properly honorably and emblematically bear the arms his enemy has assigned him. </p>
      <p>Further: the oracle says,— “All agree that for honesty honor and ability the name of Featherston ranks highest (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) throughout New Zealand.” And then he asks, “What appears against him?” What? I will answer; and that in one word:—<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. his audacious trampling on the very first principles of Responsible Government in continually daring to set at nought the Representatives of the people. Neither the Emperor of Austria nor Napoleon of France would dare to do as Dr. Featherston has done. Astonished at his conduct, I have in vain sought for a parallel in ancient or modern history. Such determined opposition to the people’s representatives, such, hindrance to the advancement of the Province, and to the public good, such ambitious views, are more worthy the consulship of Marius or the dictatorship of Sylla. It is true, Dr. Featherston is once more elected Superintendent; but he will assuredly find he has gained a Cadmean victory. Let not Dr. Feathcrston’s interested adherents sing their <hi rend="italic">Io</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">Pæans</hi>, and plume themselves as if the matter was settled. Nothing, Sir, is settled, nothing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be settled, that is not in accordance with truth; hence the eternal heavings and throes of society. Nature is asserting, man is seeking his rights. Done with, for the time, it may be, and probably is; but settled, finished, it is not. Every oppression, every opposition to truth, or to the natural rights of man, is, for all the world, as a rule-of-three sum: as the greatness of the abuse is to the best interests of mankind, so, in proportion to the effectiveness of the statement, (or, of the power,) will be the length of time required for its abolition. And the common sense of mankind in general is the slate on which this problem is to be worked. For the time we (the Reformers) are in the minority; but what a minority! a minority embracing all those who are really free; a minority containing those who, obeying conscience, have volunteered to fight for a principle; a minority which, containing as it does a <hi rend="italic">living</hi> principle, will be continually growing. This is our minority. Yes: “to brave unpopularity for conscience’ sake, to fight in small minorities the uphill battle of principles not generally acknowledged, to embrace convictions with firmness and cling to them when the tempest howls,—this is what we understand by courage.” </p>
      <p>But as I have already, no doubt, exceeded the space you can afford, me, I must bring my letter to a close ere my theme is half done. The Colonial Treasurer Richmond, in defining two genera, who unfortunately too often have to do with public matters, as “flat-fish and flies,” forgot, I think, to add a third—or, it may be a sub-genus of the first, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. the <hi rend="italic">Cuttle</hi>. Such not only sees obliquely, but invariably squirts its own inky fluid when approached by either friend or foe;—as Cowper truly says:—</p>
      <p>“The man that dares traduce, because he can    <lb/>With safety to himself, is not a man.”</p>
      <p>And yet, Sir, after all, do what we can, do what we may, there are some persons, whose intellectual faculties are so dreadfully obtuse, that on them all facts all realities all reasoning seem to be thrown away. To such persons <hi rend="italic">post hoc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">propter hoc</hi> are alike. Ask them for a reason for their so voting, and they have none to give. It is so because it is so. As I did before, so do I now. Reminding me of a story which the learned Bentley, in his literary controversy with Boyle, tells of a certain priest who, for thirty years, had read <hi rend="italic">mumpsimus</hi> in his breviary, instead of <hi rend="italic">sumpsimus</hi>; and when a learned man told him of his blunder, replied, “I will not change my old <hi rend="italic">mumpsimus</hi> for your new <hi rend="italic">sumpsimus</hi>,”—a melancholy truth this! the more so, when such persons are (in common with the most conscientious and deep-thinking) the depositaries of sacred trusts, which should be used only for the public good. </p>
      <p>                       I am, Sir,      Yours very sincerely,</p>
      <p>
