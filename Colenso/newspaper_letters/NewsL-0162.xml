                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I was really sorry (and something more) in reading in your issue of yesterday such a long and (to me) sickening notice of those wretched men the Adventists! one of the lowest and worst sects of falsely-called “Christians” known to me—who through that kind of pulling aided by you unsettle and lead astray the simple, the quiet, and the unwary. </p>
         <p>I enclose an advertisement of theirs—often repeated in the columns of the London <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> (once a fortnight, or so)— perhaps such may have escaped your notice, and I would thank you to make a fit and proper use of it early in your paper. I have long ago (and again recently) told some of their leaders my opinion of their blasphemous doings—even to the saying that I shall rejoice to see them served as a false prophet was served in the reign of one of the Tudors (?) who had prophesied the King’s death at that day 12 months:— “Keep him well. Do him no harm: until that day arrives. If the King dies, honour that prophet; if not, hang him.” And hung he was, and serve him right—and so (as I have said) I would treat Daniells—after their predicted day of March, 1896. </p>
         <p>You may make what use you please of this letter—publish it, if you will, and I shall further thank you.—I am, &amp;c., </p>
         <p>
