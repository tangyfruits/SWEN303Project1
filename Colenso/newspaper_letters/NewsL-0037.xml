         <p>To His Honor T. H. FitzGerald, Esq., J.P., Capt. J.C.L. Carter, J.P., M.P.C., Capt. R.H. MacGregor, 65th, J.P., Alex. Alexander Esq., J.P., M.P.C., John Chambers, T. Lowry and W. Boorman, Esqa., Capts. G. Chariton, J. Henton, and Alexander Blair, Messrs. John Stevens, James Hallet, R. Brenigan, M. Sullivan, W.W. Yates, F. Sutton, J. le Quesne,W. Villers, J. McKain, Jos. Torr, Peter Searles, and the other electors, who have signed the Requisition.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">Brother-Settlers and fellow-electors</hi>.—I cannot any longer refrain from replying to your public call,—contained in the Requisition so very numerously and respectably signed, which you have this day placed in my hands,—that I would consent to be put in nomination as your representative in the New Zealand Parliament. </p>
         <p>Although more than two months have elapsed since I first knew of the wish and intention of my fellow-settlers to put me in nomination for thia high honour and very important duty, I have hitherto abstained from taking any step in the matter. I have been induced to be so far inactive, partly from possessing no private desire to go any further into the strife and turmoil of political life than I have already ventured, lest I should get beyond my depth; and partly from a hope that some more fit person might be found to go for us;—the names of such I recognise among those attached to the Requisition;—would that their time was leas fully occupied!</p>
         <p> I believe that I may truly say, that you pretty well know my mind upon many (if not all) chief political matters, whether Provincial or Colonial: as proof of which I may with honest pride refer to your plain and straightforward Requisition, signed as it is so universally—by members of our Provincial Council and by magistrates, by officers in the army and by professional gentlemen, by freeholders and by runholders, by merchants and by master mariners, by tradesmen and by the working classes.</p>
         <p>Notwithstanding, I will here briefly state my opinion upon several of the more important political topics of the day. For there may be some one among our many voters still desirous of knowing my present sentiments; and it is always good to go into action with one’s colours flying. </p>
         <p>1st. It would be my aim to support the Governor and his present able Ministry: they deserve such from all true-hearted settlers, and from those of the Province of Hawke’s Bay in particular. </p>
         <p>2nd. I wish for peace, but not a dishonourable and hollow one; rather let us have a 7 years’ war than that. I should, therefore, be conscientiously obliged to vote for a powerful, energetic, and steady carrying-on of the war until the requisite basis for a sound and lasting peace is obtained. And this I should do, not merely from what has taken place at Taranaki, but from what I believe to be more or less the sad state of things generally in this Northern Island (south of Auckland), the rank and diseased growth of several years; and from what I conceive to be now absolutely requisite for the future peace and welfare of the Colony. As I take it, the spirit of headstrong resistance to the lawful authorities must be now once and for ever quelled;—the supremacy of British rule must he universally and freely acknowledged, no more to be opposed;—Law, the fountain of all order, must be fully respected;—the rights of individual natives (being now British subjects) to sell or otherwise use their own several lands, must be supported and confirmed;—and compensation, if not for the expenses of the whole war, at least for the losses sustained by our unfortunate countrymen in Taranaki, must be made. </p>
         <p>3rd. I should support the New Provinces Act, and this not merely as regards ourselves, but to seek to have its benefits thrown open as widely as possible. And, in so speaking, I do not only mean with reference to the future <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Provinces, but also with hopes of bringing back the first six of the N.Z. Provinces to be more like what was originally intended they should be in the Constitution Act;—enlarged Municipalities with ample powers, instead of Lilliputian Kingdoms. For I have an utter abhorrence of ultra- provincialism; as being a costly, arrogant, and selfish form of Government; one leading to envy and disunion, and wholly unfitted both to us as Englishmen, as well as to the rapid growth, and full development of our adopted country. At the same time I think, the New Provinces Act may by careful and judicious amendment in a few of its clauses be further improved, and made more commonly serviceable. </p>
         <p>4th. With reference to Land, I am still of the same opinion as when I spoke so fully on this subject in our Provincial Council in March last. I should generally uphold Sir George Grey’s Regulations; unless such may yet be altered for the good of <hi rend="italic">all</hi>. I should earnestly seek to obtain both for and from the natives the recognition of their common and individual rights to landed property even as ourselves: and should strive hard to get an immediate alteration of the Native Land-Purchase Department—at least in this Province. </p>
         <p>5th. Touching the (so-called) Wellington debt,—I repudiate it <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> as I have ever done; and will never willingly consent to pay any portion of it. I should cheerfully agree to a fair debtor and creditor account being rendered; on the one side, of what we have had carried away (by her),— and, on the other, of what we have had expended (as from her), adding thereto whatever penalty shall be deemed to be fair for our unfortunate and half- ruinous connexion; and then let her pay back to us what in all equity shall be shewn to be our rightful and honest due. </p>
         <p>6th. I should use my endeavours to obtain the great advantages of Steam Communication being granted to us, in common with all the Provinces, at the expense of the General Government. And should ever heartily seek to advance the united prosperity of our Province and Colony. </p>
         <p>Again thanking you for the honour you have done me;—believing that you will quite uphold my opinions herein expressed;—and looking forward to meeting you shortly at the hustings. </p>
         <p>I am, brother Settlers, </p>
         <p>Your very faithful servant, </p>
         <p>WILLIAM COLENSO. </p>
