                  <hi rend="italic">“And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: — and when we departed they laded us with such things as were necessary.” — Acts.</hi>
               </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>, —In the few plain words above quoted, we are told of the humanity and true charity of the heathen people of Melita to the shipwrecked strangers of Paul’s ship. Words which will last as long as the 4 Gospels, and be as largely circulated. In this respect not unlike what the Great Teacher Jesus himself said, of the woman of Bethany respecting her kind care in early and readily anointing him with oil,— “Wheresoever the Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.” </p>
         <p>In your paper of last evening (Saturday), you inform your readers:— “One of the men belonging to the Northumberland is anxious to know who is the agent here for the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society, as he is a member, and when wrecked at a port of Chili last year, he was forwarded Home and received an outfit.” And, in your issue of the evening before, you state:— “The seamen of the shipwrecked Northumberland are in need of some clothes. Several of the seamen this morning said, they were willing to go to Port Chalmers, but as they were without a change of clothes they could not go, when all they possessed was what they stood up in. If anything is to be done for these unfortunate men it should be done quickly.” &amp;c, —</p>
         <p>Now, this, to me, is very sad,—indicating real distress, want, on the part of <hi rend="italic">shipwrecked strangers</hi> at the Port, which should not be. For the last few days I have been daily on the look-out to learn what you there on the spot at Napier, have done, and have been trying to do, <hi rend="italic">for the shipwrecked strangers</hi>,—who lost their all in bringing stores to and for Napier. And while I read of a large general and overflowing amount of sympathy shown to our 3 townsmen (and their families), who lost their lives in vainly endeavouring to succour the shipwrecked strangers, I see little or no indications of any really good thing having been done for “poor Jack!” Indeed, I saw it stated, that any overplus remaining from the subscriptions so promptly and properly raised for the decent burial of the one poor, fellow who was drowned by the capsizing of the “Boojum,” (who though a resident in Napier had no connections there,)—such remaining money was to be used for a tombstone and fence round his grave:—here again, not a thought for “poor Jack!”— </p>
         <p>A public meeting, I see, is to take place on Tuesday night, (17th. inst.,) for the purpose of deciding on some proper plan respecting subscriptions raised in connection with our late disasters.—</p>
         <p>Unfortunately for me, I cannot possibly be present. (As I came here to the Bush for a special purpose, which I have not yet accomplished owing to the almost constant rain, and which, as the winter is fast coming on, I must do before I return to Napier.) This proposed scheme of a serviceable and really useful “Jubilee Fund” is a good one, and one that should be largely supported by Napier and Hawke’s Bay: provided, that it clearly means what it seems to say; of which, I have some doubts, and hence I now write. </p>
         <p>Is it, to raise a fund, or the beginning of a fund, for the real purpose of assisting <hi rend="italic">shipwrecked mariners</hi>? almost invariably strangers of various nationalities and creeds: or, Is it to raise funds to benefit the families of those who have been, or who may be I drowned in boats, etc., of our Harbour?—our own townspeople, who have their relatives and their friends, and it may be (in some cases) their properties, here. To me the two classes are widely distinct; insomuch that they cannot be made one of—cannot come under the same head or List . The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> class, the really shipwrecked <hi rend="italic">strangers in a foreign land</hi> having lost their all, are in <hi rend="italic">immediate need of everything</hi>, and should and must be helped “right away”: the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> class should also be aided according to their real needs and varying circumstances, to be reasonably enquired into. I have never yet found my fellow-townsmen, backward in any matter of this latter kind and class; friends and neighbours of the bereaved living ones are always sure to abound, and to stir up (if such a thing were required) any amount of sympathy in Hawke’s Bay.— </p>
         <p>I have read the Bishop of Waiapu’s letter in the “Herald” respecting a “Mariners’ Relief Fund”; and if it be the Bishop’s meaning, that such is to be <hi rend="italic">for the benefit of the real shipwrecked mariner in distress in a foreign land</hi>, then such may be well-worthy of being called a “Jubilee Relief Fund” (although the Editor of the Herald had no need to make such a blare over it, as if such an idea had only <hi rend="italic">now</hi> originated!—the same being an old one, and in part already provided for. Of course, this is owing to his ignorance of the past.) But, if the Bishop means, merely or mainly, to meet this recent melancholy occurrence of the sudden deaths of three of our townsmen, then, I say, such is out of place, and not required under the present, or any similar circumstances. All such untoward events and casualties had ever better be met and dealt with as they arise; such things are of common occurrence, and will ever be so: — “the poor ye have with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good.”— </p>
         <p>I could write a good deal more on this head (for my heart is full), but I forbear. I enclose a cheque for £8 8s Od, (which has been ready a few days, and which, I fear, I ought to have sent you before,)—for this <hi rend="italic">one purpose only</hi>, viz., to aid the shipwrecked mariners the officers and crew of the Northumberland; which, please, use at once at your own discretion; and should you have a Subscription List for this purpose, then place the said sum as follows:—<lb/>Rev.W. Colenso	.. 	.. 	  £5 5s 0d <lb/>MrW. Colenso, junr. (a sailor) 	£3 3s 0d <lb/>And another cheque shall, if required, be forwarded to you.</p>
         <p>I am, &amp;c, </p>
