                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>, In your paper of this morning you have been pleased to bring me very prominently before the public. You commence your notice of me by saying,— </p>
         <p>“Mr W. Colenso was yesterday busily engaged in soliciting support from the electors.”—</p>
         <p>As this is utterly untrue, I seem to have no alternative left me but to <hi rend="italic">deny it wholly and publicly</hi> through your paper, which I now do; and, at the same time, to ask you for your authority. I will give you a cheque for £20, payable to you (for the Hospital, or for any charitable purpose you may select) if you can truly give the name of one single elector whose “support I solicited” or asked.—</p>
         <p>Such a thing I have never done at any time,—not even in the heat and excitement of our elections of the olden days,—all such being totally opposed to my principles; as is well-known to the old resident electors of Napier, both friends and foes (political). So, again, I ask you to give us the name of only one elector, out of the many you say I “solicited;” —and so gain £20, and convict me of lying.—I am, &amp;c., </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">		William Colenso</hi>.</p>
         <p> Napier, Sept. 22, 1881.</p>
