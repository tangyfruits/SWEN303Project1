         <p>If the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted as a circumcision? .... For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly, &amp;c— Rom. ii., 26, 27. </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>, — Your correspondent, the Rev. A. S. Webb, in his letter in your Paper of Saturday last, 12th inst., on “Infidelity aud Reform,” seems, to me, to confound the true meanings of two words therein used, or played on, by him, viz. Infidelity and Orthodoxy. It is not likely, however, that he does so in his own mind; but merely from his manner of using them in his letter,—which might possibly deceive the unwary. And as one concrete example is worth a whole lot or bundle of metaphysical or philosophical disquisitions, I will just give a handy one,—taken, also, from the columns of that same Paper. For instance: Some one among you at the Port might be led to suppose that a man dressed up in a tawdry soutane with silver crosses and bullion fringes, and reciting or intoning a Creed of the Church with his face to the East, must therefore necessarily be an orthodox man:—or, in other and plainer words, a true believer and follower of the simple and lowly Jesus! </p>
         <p>Be that as it may. I happen to have here with me in my travelling box, a very excellent work by the late Dean of Westminster, entitled “Christian Institutions”; a book that I highly prize from its containing a large amount of valuable historical information and true Christian thoughts;—and from it, with your permission, I will make an opportune extract bearing largely on the matter in question.  </p>
         <p>“It used to be said in the wars between the Moors and the Spaniards that a perfect character would be the man who had the virtues of the Mussulman and the Creed of the Christian. But this is exactly reversing our Lord’s doctrine. If the virtues of the Arabs were greater than the virtues of the Spaniards, then, whether they accepted Christ in word or not, it was they who were the true believers, and it was the Christians who were the infidels.</p>
         <p>“When the Norman bishops asked Auselm whether Alfege, who was killed by the Danes at Greenwich, could be called a martyr, having died not on behalf of the faith of Christ, but only to prevent the levying of an unjust tax;—Auselm answered— ‘He was a martyr, because he died for justice; justice is the essence of Christ, even although his name is not mentioned.’ The Norman prelates, so far as their complaint went, were unbelievers in the true nature of Christ. Anselm was a profound believer, just as Alfege was an illustrious martyr. When Bishop Pearson in his work on the Creed vindicates the Divinity of Christ without the slightest mention of any of those moral qualities by which he has bowed down the world before him, the Bishop’s grasp on the doctrine is far feebler than that of Rousseau or Mill, who have seized the very attributes which constitute the marrow and essence of his nature. When Commander Goodenough, on one of the most edifying, the most inspiring, deathbeds which can be imagined, spoke in the most heroic and saintly accents to his sailors and friends, there were pious souls who were deeply perplexed because he had not mentioned the name of Jesus. It was they who for the moment were faithless, as it was he who was the true believer, although he had not spoken expressly, in a language which they could understand, of the Saviour, with whose spirit he was so deeply penetrated. </p>
         <p>“They who believe in the singular mercy and compassion exhibited in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, or in the toleration and justice due to those who are of another religion, as shown in the Parable of the Good Samaritan, they, whether they be Christians in name or not, and whether they have or have not partaken of the sacrament, have received Christ, because they have received that which was the essence of Christ,—his spirit of mercy and toleration. </p>
         <p>“Such are some of the ways in which the life of Christ is still lived on the earth.” (<hi rend="italic">pp</hi>. 38,39.) </p>
         <p>There are other portions of Mr Webb’s letter I should also like to take up, but I must forbear, having already exceeded in length for your spare space; much rather choosing to give Dean Stanley’s judicious, plain and honest words, (containing as they do a sound hearty ring,) than my own. Some of Mr Webb’s remarks I fully agree with and thank him for, while some savour much of disingenuous casuistry, and others contain the very opposite of what I conceive to be the truth;—as when (for instance) he says,— “that ‘Carpenter’s Son’ whom <hi rend="italic">we many of us worship as being Himself the Mighty Everlasting God.”</hi>!!! Alas! how truly is the saying often verified— “From the sublime to the ridiculous is only a step.”—Such is sure always to be the case by both men and ministers who love the faith of their Church or party more than they love the truth.— I am, &amp;c., </p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Having seen your remarks, in your paper of the 26th inst., concerning a notched bone in your possession, as affording “a very valuable proof as a relic belonging to a time before the Maoris arrived here,” my curiosity was aroused; and so I called at your office and examined it. I may also say that I had previously seen what had appeared in the columns of the Napier <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> respecting it, copied I believe from your paper, and upon that I had rightly concluded what it really was.</p>
         <p>I now find it to be a very common instrument indeed, being nothing more than a barbed bone made for killing pigeons, which 40 years (or more) ago I have seen both made and used in the mountain forests in the interior, on the East side of the Ruahine range, and have dined off the pigeons so taken.</p>
         <p>This barbed bone was attached as a head to a very long light spear made of tawa wood, generally about 40 feet long; this was partly secured to a suitable tree in the forests, in the proper season, on which pigeons were known (and further invited by baits) to perch, and then, in using, quickly sent upward with a jerk into their bodies, of course entering from the lower part of the abdomen. Through the barbs the bird (though strong on wing and in fluttering) was secured.</p>
         <p>The whole method of procedure (including the obtaining and the manufacture of those barbs and spears, etc., etc.) is very interesting, but much too long for your columns, even if I had the required time.</p>
         <p>I may add, that from the appearance of the worn bit of bone (3 inches long), and particularly from its blunted barbs, I should suppose it to have been an old one, almost worn out, perhaps on that account thrown away. I have seen some newly made ones of nearly twice the size, with their barbs many, very sharp, tips reversed, and acute. No doubt the bone is human, such being very commonly used by Maoris for all such purposes—barbs for sea-fishing hooks, etc.—not having any known metal.</p>
         <p>The old Maoris would call it a <hi rend="italic">tara</hi>, or a <hi rend="italic">tara-matia</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">tara-wero-manu.</hi>
               </p>
         <p>I note you seem to adhere to the <hi rend="italic">myth</hi> of the Maoris coming to this land!—I had thought I had fully exposed that many years ago.—I am, etc.,</p>
