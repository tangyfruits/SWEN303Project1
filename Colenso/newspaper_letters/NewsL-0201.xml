                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I notice in your paper of this morning, that a report from the Select Committee to the Education Board recommend (1) the sale and removal of the care-taker’s house adjoining the infant’s school in Carlyle-street, and (2) the purchase of the large corner section on the opposite side of the same street as a playground for the infants— several hundreds in number; and that such has been “adopted” by the Education Board. I regret very much to hear this, and therefore I once more write a few words on this important snbject. </p>
         <p>No doubt the doing so would give the little ones more room (which they badly need), but at what a <hi rend="italic">cost</hi>! and at what a great and ever increasing <hi rend="italic">risk</hi>, Carlyle-street (like Emerson-street, its northern end) being far too narrow, and the principal line of traffic in Napier, and the said proposed play-ground away from the school on the opposite side of the street—I shudder when I think on it. I omit remarking on the high figure asked for the said piece of land, situate as it is in the very heart of the town. And it is just the same with the principal Boys’ and Girls’ School adjoining in Clive Square, which has also long been “cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in,” on every side and crammed with scholars; and, as a matter of course, the already large number of scholars are also continually increasing. </p>
         <p>Why not boldly “take the bull by the horns,” (as the saying is,) and remove both sohools to a better and more suitable locality? Of course, to do so would cost a considerable sum, but it would prove to be beneficial to all, and by far the cheaper in the end; and once done well—it is done for ever, </p>
         <p>During the last year of my holding the office of Inspector of Sohools for Napier and the Hawke’s Bay province, the Board of Education wrote to me officially, to point out to them the most suitable site in the town for its Public Schools. I did so: and in my letter to the Board recommended the 7-acre piece of ground in Carlyle-street, then vacant, and since called the <hi rend="italic">Recreation Ground</hi>; that plot is still the fittest site for our town schools, where all the children would have ample room for play grounds. The place being at present set apart and used as a Recreation Ground (mostly for idlers), is as a feather in the balance when compared with the public good—in the far nobler use and proper purpose to which it should have been long ago set apart and dedicated. “It is never too late to mend.”—I am, &amp;c., </p>
