      <body>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,— It was with no small amount of surprise, that I read (in your paper of last week) two statements said to have been made by myself at the Public Meeting of the subscribers to the Napier School. </p>
         <p>You state, Sir, that, on my putting (as Chairman) the motion to the Meeting for the adoption of the Report, I said— “I <hi rend="italic">trusted</hi> the Motion would be adopted.” Allow me, Sir, to correct this; as it was morally impossible I could have said so. I might have said,— I “<hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> the motion would be adopted”; or, “I <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> it would” (from the many unmistakeable indications I had noticed of the temper of the Meeting). Again:—I am also reported to have said, that “<hi rend="italic">two-thirds of the contents</hi> of the Irish National School-books were scripture lessons.” Now, what I really said was, that, “I believed two-thirds of the Scriptures (such as should be read by the young, and alluding particularly to the New Testament,) were to be found in the Irish National School-books.” </p>
         <p>I also stated, (as a main reason why the objectionable term ‘anti-religious’ should be struck out from the Report,) that those Irish National School-books were assented to after long and deep consideration by the Clergy of Ireland;— including the Archbishops and Bishops of the United Church of England and Ireland—the Archbishops and Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland—and the Moderator and other influential Ministers of the Presbyterian Church there; and, that, therefore, an Education which comprised and encouraged those books could not be “anti-religious.”— </p>
         <p>Nearly £50 worth of those valuable books have already been received; some of which have been issued to schools: our Superintendent having lost no time (after the passing- of the Education Act) in sending for and obtaining a good supply. </p>
         <p>No doubt, Sir, that, in the considering of Schools for most Protestants <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, some such plan of Religious Education as that touched upon and approved of in the Report is theoretically good and pleasing. But, unfortunately, it is so in <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> only. In <hi rend="italic">practice</hi> such will assuredly be found to fail. And this not from any radical defect in itself, but from the sad defects and bias in our common human nature. Such a plan has been tried over and over, and always with failure. In fact, constituted as we are, the continued prosperity of any such a plan is chimerical and impracticable.— </p>
         <p>As I equally dread any approach towards Religious controversy either among our small community or in the columns of a Newspaper, I studiously refrain from remarking on what I heard at that Meeting.—At the same time, as a Public man—as one who in that capacity assisted earnestly in framing and carrying the present Hawke’s Bay Education Act,—I can not but consider it in some measure to be my duty to state my present opinion of that same Act; seeing, also, that, as Chairman, I was virtually hindered from declaring my sentiments at the Meeting.— </p>
         <p>Sir,—as a man who has both studied and labored not a little for the welfare of my fellow-men,—as one deeply interested in the matter of Education—as one who has been many years engaged in the work of Instruction, and also as a Protestant Clergyman—I conscientiously avow my belief, that the Hawke’s Bay Education Act is well-fitted for the general instruction of the Children of the Province, and one which all churches and denominations of Christians would do well to support. </p>
         <p>Nevertheless, I do not for a moment suppose the said Act to be perfect; neither do I say that it is such an Act as I might like to see, provided we were all of one mind and way of thinking: but, when I duly consider our many varied and heterogenous and (and perhaps) stubborn and inflammable minds;—the sad waste of time and talents which has for generations been made throughout Christendom, by each party struggling to have the upper hand in the matter of Teaching;—the still more rancorous spirit which all such  party-striving inevitably engenders,—and the daily increasing wants of the many children around who are swiftly and for ever passing from the early and limited time and term of teaching:—I say, Sir, that when I duly consider all this, I am more than ever obliged to be of opinion, that the Hawke’s Bay Education Act is both well-suited to the present time, and well-adapted to meet the wants of the Province of Hawke’s Bay in matters of Education generally.</p>
         <p>Oh! that men—Christian men—could but learn to view and consider things comprehensively, so as to speak and act for the general good! that they would but understand it to be their duty how and when to yield a little of party views, so as to obtain the hearty cooperation of the many! and so united, cordially labour together in love on the great and broad and open platform of improving the world!</p>
         <p>			I am, Sir,</p>
         <p>				Yours truly,</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">William Colenso.</hi>

            <hi rend="bold italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi>
            <hi rend="bold"> 25 August.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—We have all heard of a “time to be silent and of a time to speak.” For some time I have been considering whether the “time to speak” has not quite arrived; at least, for one who, from his position, knows a little more of public matters than many who have been both scribbling and talking about them and who (at the same time) is not a popularity hunter—does not intend to <hi rend="italic">rat</hi>—and holds public offices without being glued to them.</p>
         <p>In speaking then, or writing, Sir, on some of the common topics of the last few weeks, I shall essay to do so both calmly and reasonably; being vastly more inclined to sorrow than anger in consequence of what I have both heard and read, concerning our “Provincial. bankruptcy”— “shameful squandering of public money”— “breach of faith to poor men”— “expensive government” and “fruits of separation.” And here, Mr. Editor, you will please to allow me <hi rend="italic">en passant</hi> to say that no small portion of my regret has arisen from the manner in which you yourself in your <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> have been pleased to speak of our present position. I cannot help believing, Sir, that it is ever the duty of every faithful officer or helper of the commonweal—from the lowest subaltern to the highest Field Marshal, or from the editor of the smallest sheet of news to the thunderer in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, to inspirit and cheer the people, instead of dispiriting and making them sad; especially in times of gloom, depression and anxiety. Huc, in his travels, tells us the Chinese have a saying,— “beware of making your hearts small”—and the Maories have a similar one; and we all know the value of a plucky chap, or a single encouraging expression, in a squall or gale of wind. If it be true that the arrival of a Merry-andrew or a first rate Punch and Judy, in a village does more to dispel the vapours than a doctor’s shop; very sure I am that your lugubrious querulousness throughout your last four or five numbers has been a means of keeping the influenza among us—or, at least, of increasing its potency. Strike a higher chord man! to “There’s a good time coming boys!” instead of your hurdygurdy griping ditties of “There is nae luck,” and “Job’s tears.” Surely we have quite enough of the dismal in the melancholy tidings from Taranaki which every post and every <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> gives us?</p>
         <p>But I must remember that I have promised to write calmly and reasonably. This I shall now try to do. And I hope that every <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> settler in this Province, being a reader of your paper, will also calmly and reasonably consider what I say.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, then, with reference to our “Provincial Bankruptcy” (as it is called). Sir, you very well know that the total amount of the Estimates for the year ending 1860, (as passed by the Provincial Council) was £45,444—of which sum about £24,000 was for roads and bridges and public works—and £6000 for harbour improvements. Nearly the whole of this large sum of £45,400 (or at least £40,000) was looked for from the Land Revenue of the present year. As every building was immediately required,—and as the whole Province was in great want of roads and bridges,—(every cluster of settlers being clamorous to have a road to their homes made at once; and we well knew the wetness and short days of a New Zealand winter, and that roadmen and mechanics could not possibly live in such a season under their calico tents, (scarcely any party being anywhere snugly hutted,)—it was determined to make the most of the summer and to push on every road and work. And in order to this, the first meeting of the second session of the Provincial Council took place for a few days in November. Mark, then, a consequence:—the Province, instead of spending merely £22,722 in six months (just half of the sum voted for the 12 months), has spent in that time uearly £34,000; leaving but £10,000 to be raised and expended during the second half of the yar. Where now is the “bankruptcy?” Rather let us admire and talk of the extraordinarv fruitful yield of our newly-born Province of Hawke’s Bay! which, in six months—with a frightful and threatening native war raging, and with the greater part of her own rightful Customs Revenue stopped, by-the-way by Wellington—could actually raise £7000 more, in half the year, than her estimated Revenue! That there should be a “tightness,” or temporary want of money in the Provincial chest, under all the circumstances is not at all strange; it is no more than was to be expectcd, and should reasonably cause no alarm. I grant, if the Province had not been able to raise during he six months half of the money estimated for the year, then there would be some cause for alarm. Such, however, I have shewn, is not the case. Further: what has for the time increased the said “tightness” is the fact, that several heavy contracts amounting in all to a few thousand pounds, and for the completion of which no time was specified, have all been concluded nearly about the same time—making thereby an unusually heavy demand on the chest at once, and that too at the dead season of the year. Sir, if we calmly view the several great classes around us—sheep-farmers, agriculturists, merchants, and whalers, we shall find in every class a striking parallel. Would the owner of 5000 sheep be reasonably termed a “bankrupt,” because he could not meet every pressing demand made on him in August or September? Or, would it be right to call the farmer who had 200 acres of grain crops a “bankrupt,” if he could not promptly settle every account in November? And so with the merchant and whaler. Each great class has its own peculiar harvest or in-gathering time of wealth: just so with the Province; only with her it extends over the year. A 12 month’s revenue must fairly be allowed to meet a twelve month’s expenditure. While with her there is one far more sure and stable element than is to be found in any of the above mentioned great classes, namely <hi rend="italic">Land</hi>. While Hawke’s Bay has so many rich acres to dispose of she can never become “ bankrupt.”</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Secondly</hi>: As regards our “shameful squandering of the public money.” Sir, it is always difficult to deal with general charges, especially when made in a loose and vague way. Another of these usual weekly tirades has just appeared in your paper of this day, signed “An Honest Man” (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>!) If the writer is an Englishman, how is it that he has quite forgotten the wise and true adage of his forefathers, that “No honest man is afraid to tell his name?” It may be that public money may have been wasted; but can any one say that the Government has wilfully and designedly wasted it? It may be that the Government has not had in every case a shilling’s worth for a shilling; but can any one prove such to be by its connivance or fault? Folks should bear in mind what exertions the Government has made in order to secure the best and the cheapest; and they should not (willingly) forget that very much of that which in other Provinces is cheap, is here necessarily dear. Our timber, whether <hi rend="italic">totara</hi> or <hi rend="italic">kauri</hi>, has to be imported; so that in this article alone, what would be 10s. or 12s. per hundred feet in Wellington Province is here 25s. Has any work been executed without first advertising for tenders, both in our local paper, and in those of other Provinces? And if the accepted tender (although in every case the lowest) has been high and the work greatly needed, is the Government to blame for accepting it? It may be that your Council may have sanctioned too great an expenditure (through not foreseeing the present native war); but if so, (and which remains to be proved) such expenditure was intended for the public good, and has been at all events spent right royally among us. And certainly so many thousands spent within the Province must have benefitted the settlers of the Province. Sir, very sure I am of two things: the one, that many persons who work for, or who supply the Government (including, as I know, not a few of these very railers themselves,) seek by every possible way to “stick it in” to the Government—or, in other words, to get as much money as they can from the public purse:—the other, that our much-abused Superintendent has ever striven hard (even to the introducing of “Requisitions” into every department) to lessen and control the daily expenditure. So that I myself (to give an example) cannot get a box of pens or a quire of paper without his sanction and signature. Would that every one in Government employ had but his energy and public spirit, and had heartily co-operated with him in this matter!—</p>
         <p>Thirdly:—concerning our “breach of faith to poor men”—meaning thereby the workmen on the roads. A few plain words will suffice to shew the true state of this matter. In September, 1859, our Superintendent went to Auckland. At that time our laborers were very few, nothing like enough for a single line of road; and military labour (which we had had the advantage of on our town roads) was then nearly at an end, and soon after stopped. In order to get suitable laborers for the works, and to encourage immigration to the Province, his Honor offered a bonus (a week’s wages) to every fit and able man who would come to Hawke’s Bay to work on the roads; and, on his leaving Auckland, left the same terms with the government agents there. Several availed themselves of his offer, and came hither by different vessels. Early in January instructions were given to the agents, that no more were to be sent down. Notwithstanding, they continued to come. About that time positive orders were given to the captains of the ‘White Swan,’ ‘Eliezer,’ ‘Zephyr,’ and other vessels trading from Auckland, not to bring any more; still they brought them. And I have now by me (in the Audit office) the last accounts sent in by the captain of the ‘Zephyr,’ and others, in January last, for the bonus due to them as part passage money for severa1 persons brought down by them; which accounts were refused to be paid by our “squandering” Superintendent, because those captains had been previously warned, and which money they consequently lost. Even after this many others arrived, both from Auckland and Wellington; in some cases having been written to by their acquaintances or chums, who had come on before them. Of course, those men who so came hither were received on the various roads and works, but without any bonus. In fact, the Government had no choice; the settlers either would not or could not employ them; and the men must either have been employed by the Government, or be in the daily reception of rations as Charitable aid from the same. They could not be allowed to starve. And it should be borne in mind and duly appreciated, that the roads were not stopped working until actually more money had been expended on them than had been voted. What then was the necessary consequence? Why, 1st that twice the number of men were employed than was originally intended: 2nd, that bad good and indifferent were all at work together; the bad, unfit, weak and old, spoiling the good, fit, strong, and young, or making them discontented: 3rd, the works which could have well supported half the number throughout the year, could only afford employ for all during the half of that time: and, 4th, instead of obtaining a selected industrious, thrifty, and useful lot of first-class immigrants (as was fondly hoped), who might by-and-by become independent and valuable settlers in our Province, it was found we had got some, of whom it may be safely said “their room was better than their company.” Now, Sir, who is to blame for this? the Government? Not a bit of it. It was the men’s own fault. Though, no doubt, a share of the blame (if blame there be) rests on the agents and captains, who, as a matter of course, chiefly thought of themselves. The men forgot the common saying “The more the merrier, the less the better fare.” </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Fourthly</hi>: I have to notice the (so-called) “expensive Government.” Meaning, as I suppose, the expensiveness of that part of the Government which is, or has been, called into being through our having been made a Province. Really, Sir, I wonder some folks are not a little more modest; a little more careful. Would that people who will write, did but seek to make themselves fully acquainted with (at least) the subjects on which they choose to write. <hi rend="italic">Ne sutor ultra crepidam</hi>.<note xml:id="ftn13" place="foot" n="13"> The shoemaker should not go beyond his last—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
            </note> Would that some folks did, or could think, ere they rush into your “Open Column.” But what may not be looked for, when the old owl thought her young ones to be the handsomest birds in creation. Yesterday, by the “White Swan,” I received some Wellington papers, and among them were two copies of the <hi rend="italic">New Zealand Spectator</hi> of the 11th and 15th instant. In this of the 15th the sapient editor says (speaking of Ahuriri, and commenting on your information,)— “Complaints are general: of the insolvency of the Provincia1 Government; a fact which need not excite any surprise when the extravagant scale of its salaries is considered…. The Superintendent’s salary is £600 a year, so that the inhabitants pay a tax of 5s. a head including children for the support of this one officer”!!! Admirable! He might just as truthfully have said that the officer commanding the 65<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., costs his men £1 each!, or that the captain of the “White Swan” costs his crew £2 per head! However, I have only to refer to the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> of the 11th instant (of only 4 days previous), to find words wherewith to oppose his precious statement. In this paper he gives us a full account of a public meeting held in Wellington for the relief of the sufferers at Taranaki; and at that meeting Mr. Moore, a well-known public gentleman and old setler, said— “He thought Wellington had done nothing for Taranaki, for the Government grant was nothing; <hi rend="italic">as there was not a man in Wellington who had paid a shilling towards it</hi>.” Now, Sir, either this speaker or that writer must be wrong in principle; for, while the two cases were decidedly parallel, their words are diametrically opposite! If the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> is correct, the £1000 voted by the Wellington Provincial Council from the public chest for Taranaki, is as much to be charged to every man, woman, and child of the Province of Wellington, as the £600 voted by Hawke’s Bay Provincial Council for its Superintendent:—but he is not. Further: in your <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> of this day we have “An Honest Man” from Waipukurau saying,— “In this Province alone the last estimates passed amounted to £45,444 16s. 7d., for a population—men, women, and children—of 2323, being a proportion of £20 to each individual.” What a wonderful financier, political economist, and man of brains! (Oh! for Mr Pepys and his diary!) Now, Sir, (throwing aside such stuff) every one who thinks knows that the fewer the people the more expensive (comparatively) must any form of Government be. Just so: the fewer the people the more expensive (if in like manner calculated) must the parson, or the schoolmaster, or the parish doctor, or the purveyor of a dinner, or the constable, necessarily be: there is no mistake about it: it cannot be helped. But now, Sir, what shall we say, when the premises whence the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">New Zealand Spectator</hi> and “An Honest Man” of the Waipukurau drew their conclusions are alike vicious? Is this Government indeed supported by a “tax” that they have dared to make such a statement? It is, or ought to be, well known that this Government costs the settlers nothing. They would pay no more if the Government was much more expensive than it is; nor no less if there was no Government at all. I wonder what would be said if the Government had raised the price of all rural lands (as lately done at Otago) from 10s. to 20s. per acre? But, to return:— what is the real expense,—the real and whole sum total of salaries, as voted by and paid to this Provincial Government? Or, in other words, what in fact have we extra to pay in consequence of our separation from Wellington? I will give them:—</p>
         <p>															
            <hi rend="bold">£</hi>
         </p>

         <p>Total ... ... … ...  <hi rend="doubleunderline underline"> 2130</hi>
         </p>
         <p>For (not to mention the officers of the General Government, such as the Resident Magistrate, his clerk, the Collector of Customs, &amp;c.,) it will not, I think, be disputed that, if we had still continued part of the Province of Wellington, such officers as the Pilot and his boatmen, the Provincial Surgeon, the master of the Hospital and the Surveyors, would have been as a matter of course granted, and their expenses be much as they are now. And then the present Commissioner of Crown Lands and his two clerks, the Provincial Engineer, the Treasurer, and the Police, are all officers originally appointed by the Wellington Provincial Government, and, as a matter of course if we were still part of Wellington Province would be continued in office by her. Further: I may also remark—it is scarcely fair thus to grumble and that so early. As well might the sheep-owner in first investing in stock and run and homestead and drafting pens—or the merchant in laying in his stock of wares—or the whaler on his first outlay. Our investments of various kinds, particularly the steam-dredge, we have good reasons for hoping will return us amply for our outlay.</p>
         <p>However if it be intended that our salaries ought to be I have little to say on this head. Such may, or may not be right. I hold, Sir, and I have always held that a man who receives the pubhc money without rendering an equivalent is no other than a robber. And any Government which gives away the public money without obtaining an equivalent, or endeavoring to do so is fraudulent and base. It may be that some, or all, of our salaries are (through present and fortuitous circumstances) too high and will have to be lowered. It may be found convenient and expedient to unite some offices, so as to lessen the present expenditure; or it may be that the holders of some offices (seeing they cannot well be united to others) may so arrange as to have only to give half their time in their office for a half salary. Time is money with us all; and as I know somewhat of the value of time, I am a stickler for <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>. Our next, or some future meeting of Council may settle all this; but I venture to think that Hawke’s Bay has to keep a sharp look-out, lest through her incessant grumbling, she drive every able, faithful, fitting, and zealous officer from her service; and as we have not a great choice of men, the loss may be discovered too late.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Fifthly</hi>: I have heard that a few have gone so far as to “regret our separation from Wellington!” I have not, however, myself heard any one go to such a length as this; and I cannot help thinking that such a strange and farfetched notion could only have been uttered by some one of the notorious “minority of six.” But, be this as it may, let us again come to facts. And when we speak of fact, we can only mean what we know or have experienced. And just as I know that fire burns, and that strychnine poisons, even so I know how it would now be with us had we never been separated from Wellington. Our revenue would have been carried thither for the advancement and embellishment of Wellington as the chief town of the Province; and this, owing to her known embarassment and want of funds, we may be quite sure would have been more especially the case. Not only should we not have had our steam-dredge in the harbour, and the buoy at Pania rock, and Government buildings, and roads and bridges; but we also should not have had the spending of all our money among us. For, be it known, and be it well pondered, that (rightly or wrongly spent) upwards of £25,000 has been spent here among us by our Government during the first six months of this year, and owing entirely to separation from Wellington! Yes, Sir, £25,000; of which sum it may safely be affirmed, reasoning from past dear-bought experience, and from what we know of the pressing monetary wants of Wellington;—a very small portion would have been spent here had we not been separated from her. Let any reasonable man knowing the past go through Napier, or stand upon any of the hills of Scinde Island overlooking the town, and let him ask himself (as I have done)—What would this town now be had we not obtained separation? Talk of “regretting separation!” as I take it, it is all the same as a rule of three sum; or, rather, as a sum in the Rule of Proportion: on the side of our still being part of Wellington we might at the utmost have, during the whole year (provided we proved strong at kicking and were not easily rebuffed) just £5000—instead of £45,000—or as 1 to 9. Whilst on the side of Hawke’s Bay independent and separate we have the <hi rend="smallcaps">whole</hi>—instead of the one-ninth, or perhaps, tenth! Now our extra expenses in the shape of salaries, through incurring which we secure all our Revenue, or £45,000, amounts to a trifle over £2000, as I have already shown. As much, then, as the whole of any desired good is better than a small part, so much are we easily proved to be the better for separation from Wellington:—<hi rend="italic">q.e.d.</hi>

         <p>In conclusion, Sir, I trust you will forgive the length of my present communication. Its importance (if correct, as I deem it to be,) is great; and my public position—both as Provincial Auditor and as a member of the Provincial Council for the Town of Napier, prompts me to write fully and truly what I know, for the information and quieting of many of the scattered settlers of this Province, who, I fear, have been of late and in these exciting times unduly alarmed.</p>
         <p>		I am, Sir,</p>
         <p>		Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">		William Colenso</hi>.</p>
