            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your issue of the 26th instant you say, “ Mr. Colenso made a long and wordy statement, in which he maintained that either the rate could not be collected till the end of the year, or that the Act was repugnant to the Constitution Act.” There was, however, another proposition, and perhaps the most important one (which I fully stated to the Court, and which, also, the rate-collector admitted on oath), viz., that I had tendered to him in coin 6s. 8d.—four months’ rate—being the whole arrears of rate to that time, and that I should also pay the residue as it became due. </p>
         <p>May I ask you to insert this in your next issue?—I am, &amp;c.,</p>

         <p>“A word in season.”— “A time to speak.” 	<lb/>“Can ye not discover the signs of the times?”</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Herald</hi> of this day your article concludes with these words: “All that is wanted is <hi rend="smallcaps">confidence</hi>, the want of which shuts out capital and labour, and impairs the energies of all.” These are true words, and to them I heartily assent. But how is this confidence to be brought about? First, we must have <hi rend="italic">peace</hi>; a true, substantial, firm, and lasting peace; from this will naturally spring confidence, and mark, <hi rend="italic">from this only</hi>. To this end let us all (Governor, Government, and people) be determined to do two things: 1.—To do justice; 2—To acknowledge error. </p>
         <p>1. To do justice—prompt and quick, even and fair, common-sense, not tedious legal justice. “Do ye to others as ye would they should do to you” if you were in their place. </p>
         <p>2. To acknowledge error, frankly and fully, wherever and whenever such has unfortunately been done; even to the retracing of our steps if needful and possible. (Let us not think too highly of ourselves as the “superior,” unerring race, adorned with a thousand highflown superlatives of our own inventing). Let us remember the fable of the man sitting astride on a lion, and the lion’s truthful remark. Let us endeavour to consider our political conduct in the light of God’s truth,—to which scrutinising light it will have to be submitted.) </p>
         <p>In order to this:—</p>
         <p>I. Let the war be immediately and everywhere stopped. </p>
         <p>II. Let a truce be proclaimed. </p>
         <p>III. Let an accredited messenger be sent from the Governor to the Maori King Tawhiao (not as king, but as the acknowledged head of many great tribes) to ask his aid towards making peace; and from him to the various Hauhau leaders; and a similar messenger to the chiefs of the principal friendly Maori tribes. The basis of such peace to be:—l. A general amnesty. 2. The return of all (nominally) confiscated lands, subject to certain conditions; such as, on the one side, all useful surveys and substantial improvements to be repaid; on the other, certain spots which it is necessary should be retained to be paid for. 3. Common freedom to all religions however absurd. </p>
         <p>IV. Let Peace Commissioners be appointed from both sides, and a place be mutually arranged for their meeting. </p>
         <p>V. Let powers be given to them to settle equitably our difficulties, and all great vexed questions. </p>
         <p>If this is done, and the British Commissioners be fit and high-minded men—men of comprehensive views, and able to grasp the whole subject,—and if all the terms then and there agreed to be hereafter honestly and promptly carried out,—then, I venture to prophesy a firm and lasting peace to the Colony of New Zealand; otherwise you will not, cannot have it—at least for a long generation, a long and weary time of bloodshed and misery to both races: and, note well, that such a peace so obtained by conquering or destroying isolated tribes, whenever that may be, <hi rend="italic">will not be lasting. </hi>
         </p>
         <p>I have long entertained those views; I now openly avow them. I know, in doing so, I shall be assailed by the unthinking, with—</p>
         <p>1. What of the murders, atrocities, massacres, and cannibalism? </p>
         <p>2. What of the present numerous semi-military bands? </p>
         <p>3. What of the expense and loss? </p>
         <p>4. What of our British name and reputation?</p>
         <p>I reply, to the first question—Who began the war with the “Hauhaus?” Who unjustly treated them—men, women, and children—by illegal wholesale banishment without trial? Who, on those Chatham Island “prisoners” returning to their own lands, in a most creditable, and gallant, and peaceful manner, foolishly and insanely, and without authority, attempted to capture and destroy them! instead of bringing them bread and water, and giving them the right hand and welcoming them back? Who carried on the war against them <hi rend="italic">in Maori fashion</hi>? Quietly mark this, and note—they have (<hi rend="italic">for the first time with us</hi>) also carried on the war against us and our Maori allies in Maori fashion, which we call murder, massacre, and atrocities (and so deceive ourselves, as if such were really different from our own “civilised” mode of warfare)! but hitherto we have only begun to know what it is; and note well, I beg, that to the present time hunted “Hauhaus” have not retaliated upon a single European living quietly on lands fairly purchased or leased. We have already killed something like seven or eight to one; besides inflicting irretrievable loss and evil. Moreover, fanatical outbreaks and rebellious <hi rend="italic">emeutes</hi>, everywhere occurring in this world’s sad history, are never rigorously revenged. </p>
         <p>To the second question, I reply—The sooner they are disbanded the better for the colony. </p>
         <p>To the third—Bear it; it can be borne to restore peace and confidence; it is by far the better, the easier, and the cheaper load. </p>
         <p>To the fourth—It will gain additional lustre, which ten years war and eventual success will never bring it. Our Maori foe cannot, will not reflect tauntingly upon it, as we have driven them from all their strongholds, and killed seven or eight to one. </p>
         <p>Having said a word to the unthinking, I would also say a word to the really thoughtful among us, including the God-fearing man, and in particular to those of all the churches who believe in God’s particular providence and in His stern retribution. </p>
         <p>1. Note how successfully this handful of men (“Hauhaus” and “rebels” we call them) have sped; note how they have been hunted; the enormous powers of all kinds brought to bear against them—armies, seven or eight to one—the most improved ordnance and big guns, as well as superior rifles and ammunition; heaps of prayers and invocations, public and private; all the power and strategy of the “superior” race, both “spiritual and carnal,”—and note the result. The different Hauhau leaders, on whose devoted heads in particular high prices have been set, who have bravely stood to the death in every fight amid showers of balls, are all still safe, as if they were invulnerable, while not a few of our best and good men are gone! With death in every form, including starvation, and want and misery, and with little of human aid, they have been long familiar. </p>
         <p>2. Note also, I pray—The strange, the utter reversal of what is promised to the God-fearing man, of what has hitherto been his lot—freedom from fear and dread. How comes it that so great a panic everywhere prevails? That instead of a few of the “superior” race overawing a whole band of Maoris (“one putting a thousand to flight,” as was formerly the case), now two Maoris even at a distance, or even a fire on some distant hill, are enough to arouse ugly misgivings, and to cause a whole settlement of stalwart whites to flee as affrighted hares! Everywhere the majority of the settlers are suffering from this foolish affection, even where they are dwelling together in large numbers, and where there has been, and is no cause whatever for any such fear. How comes all this? Think over these questions quietly, and dare to follow them out. Is ours altogether a righteous cause? Have we the god of battles with us, or have we not? </p>
         <p>Now it is just because I believe all this, that I am not sorry that Mr. M‘Lean is no longer Government Agent; for while he held that situation and stuck to his old schemes (policy I cannot call them), no real confidence could ever arise, as a firm and lasting peace could not possibly under such schemes ever be restored,—for, at the most, as soon as a so-called peace had been at an enormous expense patched up in one place it would break through in another: it would only be the old, miserable union of “iron and miry clay.” I know very well that some few (if they dare speak their thoughts) would say, “Exterminate.” To this I reply, you can’t do it; and if you could, it would take you years to accomplish. Be warned in time: your (present) “friendlies” (mercenaries, on whom some of you depend so very much) would not allow of it. </p>
         <p>Sir, I did hope that the arrival of a son of Her Majesty the Queen among us, the first arrival too of a Prince of the blood royal on those shores, would be advantageously made use of in the way I have above indicated. From my knowledge of the national feelings of the New Zealander, I cannot help stating as my firm belief, that such might have been beneficially done,—and even now it may not be too late.—I am, etc., </p>
