                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—You have greatly surprised me in your paper of this morning with a short notice concerning myself taken from “a London paper,” which is partly wrong. And as it contains a grave error (and I do not wish to wear peacocks’ feathers) I feel called on to set it right. It is stated (<hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>) that, “I translated the Bible into Maori,” which is not correct. The translation of the whole Protestant Bible into Maori was not completed by any one of the Church of England missionaries. The first entire edition of the New Testament was mainly translated from the original Greek by the Rev. W. Williams (afterwards the first Bishop of Waiapu), who also prepared it wholly for press: it was printed and bound by me. Portions also of the Old Testament—as many chapters of Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Isaiah, and Daniel, with Jonah and the Psalms entire—were translated by others of the early missionaries; Mr Puckey and the Rev. Dr. Maunsell taking prominent parts—in these translations I assisted; all those were also printed by me. And, of course, all that was done long before the first Bishop (Dr Selwyn) came to New Zealand. Subsequently the whole translation of the Bible went through a complete critical revision by a Board elected by Bishop Selwyn, in which the late Bishop Williams and Rev. Dr. Maunsell largely worked. I have purposely abstained from giving particulars concerning the whole work of translation of the Bible into Maori from first to last, which, however, are well known to the Church Missionary Society (London) as well as to me.—I am, &amp;c., </p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your paper of this morning you tell us that the R.C. Archbishop Redwood, preaching on Sunday at St. Patrick’s Church, South Dunedin, said:— “We live in an age of adulteration. If ever there was a century remarkable for its adulteration it is this nineteenth century with all its boasting. It is a dishonest century, and you can hardly get anything that is genuine.” Plain and strong words these, containing a large amount of truth, but a little extra thought on the part of the preacher might have led him to trace back and consider the origin of the <hi rend="italic">greatest adulteration</hi>, namely, the Church of Rome, which so heinously adulterated Christian teaching and the Holy Scriptures, so that the pregnant words of Our Lord to the leaders and teachers of the ancient Jewish Church are equally as applicable to the Romish Church and her adulterated teachings of this day:— “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites… in vain do they worship me teaching doctrines and precepts of men…. Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.” (<hi rend="italic">Mark</hi> vii,) Through which grievous departure of the Church of Rome from the teaching of the early Christian Church may be fairly ascribed all the numerous adulterations of true Christian teaching down to the present day—and “the cry is, still they come,” which wretched spawn is already so prominent broadcast among us here in Hawke’s Bay! for “the people,” so easily galled and cheated in matters of religion, “love to have it so!”—I am, &amp;c., </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">1898 Governor Eyre. 	<lb/>
                  </hi>
                  <hi rend="bold italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi>
                  <hi rend="bold"> 6 October. </hi>
               </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your paper of this morning you have a letter from Mr Hindmarsh, in which he says, that “Your article in last Saturday’s <hi rend="smallcaps">Herald</hi> on Governor Eyre was so full of errors that he ventures to point them out.” However, in his doing so, he has committed not a few errors himself, being (as it appears in his opening remarks) much inclined to depreciate or “run down” Governor Eyre, Police Court fashion! Saying— “He had emigrated to New South Wales when 16 or 17; he was in Adelaide, having brought a mob of cattle overland,” &amp;c., &amp;c. </p>
         <p>Now, I knew Governor Eyre personally pretty well, and for some time corresponded with him both privately and officially; and have a copy of his work—<hi rend="italic">Discoveries</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in Central Australia</hi>, 2 vols, presented to me by him. And having, from my earliest days, been deeply interested in Australian explorations and discoveries, and read with avidity those of Oxley, Sturt, Mitchell, and Grey; and, also, intimately known Cunningham and other scientific men, who labored so long and efficiently in that country, whose names are high on the historic roll, I think it right to say a few words concerning Governor Eyre.</p>
         <p>Before that Mr Eyre went on his long and perilous journey in 1840, from Adelaide to King George’s Sound, throughout more than 24 degrees of longitude, he had performed several journeys in the unknown interior of Australia: Colonel Gawler being then the Governor of South Australia. For eight years previous Mr Eyre had been resident in Australia, during which he had visited many of the located parts of New South Wales, Port Phillip, South Australia, Western Australia, and Van Diemen’s Land. In the years 1836–1840 he had conducted expeditions across from Liverpool Plains, in New South Wales, to the county of Murray, from Sydney to Port Phillip, from Port Phillip to Adelaide, and from King George’s Sound to Swan river, besides undertaking several explorations towards the interior north from Port Lincoln and from Adelaide. </p>
         <p>I have myself pretty often, 50–60 years ago, had to bear np against many hardships in my travelling throughout the length and breadth of the North Island of New Zealand; but mine shrink into insignificance when compared with those endured and overcome by Mr Eyre in that terrible journey, during which his overseer and other companions were murdered by the blacks, his stores stolen, and abandoned, and he with only one black lad reached Albany on foot in the uttermost state of destitution, after a journey of one year and 26 days. I have ever considered that overland journey of Mr Eyre as being one of the wondrous ones of modern times. </p>
         <p>It was after that journey Mr Eyre was invited by the Governor of the colony to undertake the task of re-establishing peace and amicable relations with the numerous native tribes of the Murray River and its neighborhood, whose daring and successful outrages in 1841 had caused great losses to, and created great apprehensions among the colonists, hoping that his personal knowledge of, and practical experience among the aborigines might prove serviceable, and from September 1841 until December 1844, he was closely occupied with the duties of his office, so that Mr Eyre had a very good initiation for the higher office of Lieutenant Governor of New Zealand; however greatly he may have subsequently erred while Governor of Jamaica.—I am, &amp;c.,</p>
