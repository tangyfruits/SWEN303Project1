         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Without apology or introduction I write to tell you that I have been very much pleased in reading a long extract from one of your papers (<hi rend="italic">Timaru Herald</hi>, 20th March, 1882) given us in our local—<hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi>—on Wednesday last. I could only wish I had a few copies of your paper containing it (in its entirety), to send to my friends in England by this outgoing mail. It is a long time since I have seen anything so real and so truthful, affecting the poor misguided and hunted Maoris who were in arms against us. </p>
         <p>I send you herewith a copy of a pamphlet I published at that time (ten or eleven years ago), in which you will find not a little wholly in agreement with what you have now published in your paper. I hope you may find time to read it through. My writing it nearly cost me a prosecution!<note xml:id="ftn43" place="foot" n="43"> The issues of the <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> for 1871–1876 are missing from “Papers Past” so I am unable to find any information on Colenso’s putative prosecution—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
                  </note> It is a great gratification to find another mind, both independent and at a distance, agreeing with one. </p>
         <p>I think, however, your opinion of Te Kooti too severe; hitherto you have only known him through his bitter implacable foes! Perhaps what I have also published at the end of the said pamphlet, may serve to give you a more favorable opinion of him. Once more thanking you for your able article, </p>
         <p>	I am, &amp;c.,  <hi rend="smallcaps">	Wm. Colenso.</hi> 
               </p>
         <p> Napier, April 15th, 1882.</p>
         <p>[We have to thank Mr Colenso for forwarding us a copy of his pamphlet on Kereopa.—Ed. T.H.]</p>
