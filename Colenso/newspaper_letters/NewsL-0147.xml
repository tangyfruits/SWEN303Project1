         <p>“O foolish Galatians! Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth.”—Paul. </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I (with, no doubt, many of your subscribers and readers) heartily thank you for your able article of this day on “Veneered Savages.” I agree with you in your plain yet forcible observations; and would fain hope such may have some good effect.—</p>
         <p>But why have you (or, say, one of your daily contemporaries here) not come out in a similar way but stronger, on the Veneered Infidelity stalking publicly, shamefaced and rampant here in Napier? I have been absent 2 months from Napier residing in the Bush, yet while there seeing your paper (with others); and the question has not unfrequently been put to me, (on reading the blasphemous mouthings of this newly-arrived American lecturer Daniells—though gilded and sweetened for the nonce,)— “Why do the Napier folks endure or support such things? “And my only answer has been,—Such, unfortunately, has long been their peculiar custom or fashion,—to take up with anything new or strange, no matter of what kind or description, high or low; only (too often) the lower and more abusive of all that is good proved and long established the better!” We have had it, in low theatricals, in politics, in racing and gambling (including the totalisator and all its attendant crimes and horrors), in rinking, and now in what is falsely termed Religion! And for most of these utter abominations—Rinking, Table-turning and “Spiritism,” Mormonism, and Adventists—we are indebted to our farahead cousins in America. </p>
         <p>I could better understand why the low the vulgar the careless and the scoffer should unite in supporting (for the time) this man Daniells,—Even to their bearing him on their shoulders in triumph, crowning him with laurels, and putting silver into his purse: but how any members, or frequenters of Christian churches, any readers of the Bible, any thoughtful, any respectable steady moral person, any well-wisher of the community should do so, is the thing that astonishes me!—</p>
         <p>Because, Jesus himself—our Great Teacher and the Head of his Church; warned his disciples that such would be, and be carried on even to that extent as “to deceive the very elect;” laying down the safe and simple rule for them to follow,— “Go ye not after them,”—listen not to them. And, also, because, plenty of such opposition arose very early in the infant Christian Church; which called for the serious and plain warnings of the Apostles themselves, as we find them recorded in their several Epistles concerning such innovators;—and all such (it should he borne in mind) was seemingly done for the faith or the Christian Religion!—Paul could even thus write of those plausible designers to the Corinthian Church:— “Such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed; into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his Ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works.”—2 <hi rend="italic">Cor</hi>. xi. 13–15. </p>
         <p>We have lately heard of one of the great London publishers, Vitizelly, having been prosecuted and fined £100, with costs and loss of all his books, for his publishing a translation of some filthy French novels,—Vitizelly, too, pleading, Guilty; such being injurious to morals. But how much more, I would ask,—aye, stand forward in the public arena of Clive Square, Napier, aud ask and demand,—How much more readily should this blatant blasphemer of the Holy Scriptures (albeit his being “silver-tongued”) be prosecuted and fined, and his wares (or “Kit or tools”) be condemned, for his daring polluting the river of God—the water of life, the Holy Scriptures? And thus unsettling the minds of many and even imperilling the salvation of their souls! Don’t let anyone get up and tell me of the poor creature’s zeal arising from his ignorance!—hence, too, much of his apparent simplicity and even devotion!! Why the Devil himself, we are told by St. Matthew, daringly quoted Scripture to Jesus, thinking thereby to gain his own ends and carry the day! </p>
         <p>And, as I said to some friends in the Bush, so I say now:—Give me the t’other notorious American Lecturer Ingersoll, with all his glaring and coarse faults, and defects,—there was something open and manly about him; before this fellow with his cunningly-contrived, smooth, insidious and destructive tales. </p>
         <p>In conclusion; this one word of faithful warning would I utter:—Men of Napier! look to yourselves; give the teachings of this deluded man no place, no quarter! I, your old man, plainly tell you, (and I know what I am writing about,)—that nothing you may ever have done will ever cause you so much uneasiness and bitter distress of mind at the last, (in the day of serious thought, and reflection, should such even be granted you,) as this one error, or sin, or crime, namely, that of your having wilfully received and supported the false and soul-destroying teachings of this American Daniells. Remember the words of Jesus, (thrice repeated by Matthew, by Mark, and by Luke,)— “Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him; neither in this world, neither in the world to come.”—<hi rend="italic">Matt</hi>. xv. 32, &amp;c.,—I am, &amp;c, </p>
