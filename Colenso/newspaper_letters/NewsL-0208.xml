         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I thank you for giving us in your paper of this morning two important cablegrams: (1) that “the Kolle-Turner process for the treatment of rinderpest had saved 700,000 head of cattle to Cape Colony.” (2) That “Mr Balfour” (that thoughtful and clear-headed British statesman) “in his Bristol speech, referring to the agitation and friction in the Church of England at present, urged that it would be wise if the Church used its episcopal power to tide over the Ritualistic difficulty.” I mention these two items together; the thoughtful mind will discover my reason for so doing, my meaning. </p>
         <p>It is pleasing and hopeful to find, from late English papers to hand, that the Bishops of the Church of England are prompt and moving in this matter. The Bishop of Winchester, at his Diocesan Conference on 22nd September, in his able address, said:— “Bishops and clergy alike have been of late years too lax, or, to use an expressive local phrase, too “casual” in the matter. That episcopal authority will now be exercised decisively and if need be sternly, wherever in England any difficulty of the sort occurs I do not doubt…. Would that I could see no danger of another sort! I think it real and growing.... It lies deeper and extends more widely; it is far more difficult to specify or to define. It may be described as a growing tendency among certain men to blur, or ignore, or explain the distinctive character of the Church of England; the Church, not Catholic only, but Reformed; to forget, or at all events not to adhere to, the principles for which the Reformers cared and fought and suffered; a tendency to belittle (by implication if not in words) the changes wrought out for good by English Churchmen, in the century and half of effective fruitful controversy which we lightly call the Reformation. I think the matter is vital to our Church’s healthy life.... May I just say that in accentuating what the Prayer-book enjoins or allows with regard to private confession, some teachers seem quietly to forget the history of the words, and to ignore the significant changes that our Church deliberately made. Hence a danger neither fanciful nor small. Another, and that surely the gravest danger of all, is to be seen in the teaching and usages of an increasing number of parish priests with regard to the Holy Communion—devoted enthusiastic men and women are swinging back, half unconsciously, into something perilously like the materialistic doctrines of the fifteenth century. Is there no danger that some of our people in some of our churches are, in this particular matter, insensibly drifting away from the true ‘proportion of the faith’ of the Church of England, and that with the drift there comes a corresponding peril of something sadly like the materialistic superstitions of pre-Reformation days? Conditions change, and the pitfalls that we now dread are not all the actual pitfalls of those days. Then the worshippers’ Communions had become rare; now they are numerous, and often the roll is largest in the very churches wherein the risk I speak of is most real.... I am not alluding now to overt acts in direct contravention of the book of Common Prayer;.... I am speaking of what is more nebulous, more difficult to grasp,—a tendency, a tone, an atmosphere of teaching and of worship which for some minds has a perilous attraction. I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say.” </p>
         <p>The Church Congress, also, commenced its business at Bradford on 27th September. The Bishop of Ripon, the president, made an able speech, from which I cull a few striking and pleasing quotations. With him on the platform were the two Archbishops of Canterbury and of York (who both spoke and also preached) and several other English and Irish Bishops. The president said:— “It would be affectation to deny that there were elements in our Church which may, if we are not careful, go far to cripple her usefulness and to hinder the readiness of her obedience. Our internal divisions are, perhaps, our greatest foe. There were men whose tendency was more Catholic than Protestant; there were others whose tendency was more Protestant than Catholic; but the most Protestant claimed to be Catholic, and there was a sense in which the most Catholic was not ashamed to call himself Protestant. There is a noble Catholicity, and there is a noble Protestantism, and it would be sad indeed if these terms should be prostituted or narrowed in meaning. If Protestantism means the claim of the human spirit to direct access to the Father of Spirits, the protest against the idea of vicarious responsibility, and against every attempt to check the freeness and fulness of the message of Divine forgiveness,—then, it is a term which no Church need fear to use, for it means the preservation of primitive and essential Christianity.... If Catholicity is confounded with the practice of customs which have only a mediæval sanction; if it claims to be identified with notions of ecclesiastical officialism which were unknown in the Church of Christ during the first century and a half of her purest life; if it insists on transforming permissible opportunities of help into necessities of Christian life and practice; if it takes the ideals of Catholicity from the un-Catholic corruptions of the Latin Communion, then we feel that Catholicity is robbed of its majestic voice, and has become the snarl of intolerant sectarianism. Every new epoch has added new dogma to faith, and with every new dogma has gone further from the simplicity of Christ. The future of the world does not belong to Latinism, and so the vision of Protestantism will be fulfilled. The religion of the future will neither be Protestant nor Catholic, but simply Christian. The dogmas of the Churches which have separated communion from communion will fall off as autumn leaves before the fresh winds of God. Many views which in the very Providence of God have played their part in cleaning the thoughts of men will pass into forgetfulness. Men will not grieve to see the old things go, for a larger faith will be theirs; they will not think God’s world will fall apart because we tear up parchments more or less. The Church of God will renew its youth, it will be content with a simpler symbol because it will have learned Christ. It will not need any longer Trent, or Westminster, or Lambeth, or the Vatican to lead it. It will be satisfied with simpler thoughts and a purer faith. It will be satisfied to realise that there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all.” </p>
         <p>I fear I may have occupied too much of your paper, but my excuse is, that here in these living words we have “thoughts that breathe and words that burn.” Much good, I hope, will be effected by them through their being read and thought over by your numerous readers (Bush and elsewhere) on this coming Sunday.—I am, &amp;c., </p>
