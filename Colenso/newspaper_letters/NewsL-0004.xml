      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your report of the Public meeting held on the 1st inst., (in your issue of this day,) you have, I think, reported me as saying what I certainly did not: <hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>.— “before severing a chain that could never be unsevered;”—rather, “before <hi rend="italic">welding</hi> a chain that could never be unsevered”:—that “more statistical information was needed”:—rather; that “there was statistical information enough in that draft memorial to make several good ones”:—again: that it should be a document drawn up by an Englishman, to be presented by an Englishman, &amp;c.”:—rather (after I had alluded to Washington, and the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> American declaration which had ended in their glorious Independence, and that such a document was one which posterity had and would admire; I said,) that, “such a kind of document should also be drawn up by us as our children and grandchildren would not be ashamed of—one worthy of preservation in the future archives of Ahuriri—one drawn up by Englishmen, to be presented by Englishmen to an English Governor &amp;c.”: again, instead of saying (in conclusion,)— “in ether case it was sham and a humbug”: rather that “I had always opposed, and ever would oppose, all sham and humbug.”—</p>
      <p>Further: pardon me, Mr. Editor, when I say, that (believing you to be a countryman of Burns,) you ought to have known him better than so to “<hi rend="italic">murther</hi>” the couplet which I quoted (thus corrected—from memory):</p>
      <p>“Her prentice han’ she tried on man,   <lb/>And then she made the lasses O!”</p>
      <p>                       I am.</p>
      <p>                               Yours very sincerely,</p>

      <p>
      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Being desirous of making public a few additional remarks on the subject of Streets, Sewerage, and Drainage for our Town of Napier, I avail myself of your courtesy and “Open Column” to enable me to do so. </p>
      <p>And, in order that I may be the better understood, I will endeavour to write plainly;—classifying under the following heads:—I. The Town of Napier, its advantages and disadvantages, its present wants and its present resources. II. The Wellington Streets, Sewerage, and Drainage Act, its peculiarities, and its unfitness for Napier. III. What is really needed, and how such may the better be obtained. </p>
      <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The Town of Napier, its advantages and disadvantages, its present wants and its present resources.</hi> (This I shall barely consider with sole reference to the subject of this Letter.) The site of the Town of Napier is, as we all well know, very peculiar. Perhaps no Town of modern times has been laid out on such broken, irregular, and varying ground. The length, N. and S., and breadth, E. and W., of the Township are about equal; throughout which and in every direction Streets have been plentifully marked out. And, while some of them lead up precipitous hills and over sandy beaches, and others through deep salt-water lagoons and fresh-water swamps, every Section, (amounting to about 600) good or bad, has quickly found a purchaser: not withstanding, the number of proprietors is but small when compared with the number of Sections. Now it is mainly owing to those two facts—its very peculiar configuration and state, and the present small number of proprietors,—that the great difficulty of its Streetmaking Sewerage and Drainage consists. For, had its site been naturally much like most other parts of the earth, which have from time to time been equally honored, the matter of putting it into shape and keeping it clean could be easily accomplished. Still, it has stone within itself for metalling and paving; and water also for all Sewerage purposes. But here, at the very outset, a question obtrudes itself:—Is any such Street-making Sewerage and Drainage Act as this Wellington one really needed? Let me see:—I take my stand at the Royal Hotel, the S. terminus of Carlyle Strcet, the <hi rend="italic">principal</hi> thoroughfare; thence to the Land Office, at the N. end, is about a mile; upon this Street I count, on the one side, 11, and on the other 5, houses; from the Land Office I proceed over the second great thoroughfare, Shakespeare Gulley, on to the Pilot’s house at the extreme anchorage, a distance of upwards of another mile, and here I find a much less number of houses: so that, as far as <hi rend="italic">Sanitary</hi> measures (Sewerage and Drainage) are included, there can not possibly be any need for them:—no, not even if the climate of Napier was as pestilential as that of Fernando Po, or the banks of the Tyber; how much less when the climate of New Zealand is so very well-known to be everything but proverbial for its good quality, and ours, here at Ahuriri, among the best of it! Still, it will be said, “Our roads and Streets must be made; Carlyle Street is partly impassable in winter, and Shakespeare Gulley, during and after rains, is not much better.” True, must be the reply; but, with our limited resources, and very infantile state of our young town, we must ever be content to do as our fathers did before us—crawl before we run. “<hi rend="italic">Slow but sure</hi>” must be our motto; and it will be well for us if we ever bear it in mind; as by so doing we shall both keep <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the Bankrupt’s List, and keep <hi rend="italic">from</hi> being laughed at for having undertaken what we could not perform. The modern watch-word of “<hi rend="italic">Up boys and at them</hi>!” (though spoken on the quarter-deck of a 120 gun ship, amid much applause and world-wonder,) did not achieve so much as the wary old British “<hi rend="italic">Steady boys, steady</hi>”:—so, steadily onwards, slow but sure, should ever be the prosperous motto for Ahuriri. As an owner of land in the town of Napier, (and, perhaps, soon to be a resident there,) I cannot but wish and seek her advancement; but I consider it almost suicidal to both her real progress and interests, to think of burthening her with heavy rates and taxes in her nonage under the high-sounding (though fallacious) phrase of improvements. Nature makes no leaps; and that art, or state of society, is the surest and best, because most like Nature, which imitates her. Some may here think on Melbourne; but that gigantic youngling is altogether an exception. We have not her <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> foundation; notwithstanding ours may be equally as sure—perhaps more stable (let a future generation decide) more after the growth of the old English <hi rend="italic">Oak</hi> than of that of the <hi rend="italic">Blue Gum</hi>. But even the town of Melbourne, with all her gold and her enormous population and intertropical climate and her Governor resident and her influential Councils, allowed nearly 20 years to elapse before she thought it time to have a Sewerage and Drainage Act: notwithstanding in less than a year after the first house was erected she had more than double our present population. Passing indeed an act for introducing water into the town, and entering into a contract with a company to pay them £100,000 for doing the same, before she brought out the Sewerage Act. </p>
      <p>II. <hi rend="italic">The Wellington Streets Sewerage and Drainage Act, its peculiarities, and its unfitness for Napier.</hi> Now this Act, Mr. Editor, I cannot but consider as peculiarly Wellingtonian; and (not unlike several other of her Acts) one which has caused her Citizens (being Englishmen) a good share of heart-burning and grumbling: for John Bull always grumbles, even to bellowing, when he has to dip his hands into his pockets, especially for Rates, and that twice in one day! This Act, I have said, is peculiarly Wellingtonian:—1st by its ostentation and specious objects (as if Wellington was a second Nineveh); as well as from its unhappy un-English feature of interference with the sacred rights of private property; which, in a small place like Wellington, ever-heaving with bitter political strife, is anything but a step towards a development of the better feelings of humanity, or a dwelling together in unity:—And, 2nd, from its being very much more suited to her as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> N. Zealand Land-Company’s town than to any other. For, be it known, that, when this Act was passed in 1855, (fifteen years after her birth,) the long straggling town of Wellington (salubriously enough situated for 2 miles and more on the edge of Port Nicholson harbour, well watered with several brawling streams, and plentifully ventilated with strong and healthy breezes,) possessed only 3208 souls, of whom upwards of 1500 were children! And yet, when the Act alone is duly considercd, a stranger would naturally suppose, that the town or city for which it was framed was either dreadfully unhealthy, or overcrowded, or both. In the Act we find a whole host of officers, and offices and Works not merely legalised, but (as I take it.) made actually preparatory to any Streetmaking &amp;c. being effected. (See particularly, clauses 35, 36, 37, 38, 49, 51.) A key however to this (and to much more of a similar nature and emanating from the same source,) is at hand; namely, that Wellington has had for a long time the modesty to consider herself as the town <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>, of N. Zealand, and the only one of all already, or to be, born, fitted to become the capital of the Britain of the South! This unfelicitous gasconading characteristic has however already done her no little injury (scarcely yet, perhaps, clearly seen by her citizens); but, without enlarging just now on this point, what we have to guard against is, not to be so deceived as to follow with our eyes shut in her wake. Still, as I have said, the Act was in some measure <hi rend="italic">suited</hi> to her <hi rend="italic">as the N. Zealand Land-Company’s town;—</hi>for in many of the proprietors of her town lands were not only <hi rend="italic">absentees</hi> in the highest degree, but had also, as the saying is, got hold of those lands for “a song”; and it should not be forgotten, that one of that Company’s binding engagements was, that “a tithe of all their purchases was to be reserved for the Natives”; through which they were thoughtlessly located in several spots in the Town of Wellington, to the subsequent grief however of the Citizens: hence, perhaps, might possibly be argued the correctness of such an “Algerine” manner of proceeding as that laid down in clauses 96, 97. Further, it should also be remembered, that Wellington (as I have already intimated,) is everywhere well supplied with fresh water; and has also close at hand, even on the immediate shores of her fine harbour, abundance of timber for fencing and other purposes; hence it may also be inferred, that, seeing she was entirely free from any cares respecting wood and water, and, consequently, never even once dreamily visited with the faintest penumbra of anything concerning a <hi rend="italic">water rate</hi>, she could the better afford to be a little extra-expensive in the way of Street-making Sewerage and Drainage, not to mention <hi rend="italic">Fencing</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now from all those things—both good and bad—Napier is particularly exempt. She certainly does not wish to imitate the unlucky frog, and go on brooding over her immense qualifications till she bursts, saying,— “I am the most central; I have the greatest extent of natural grass pasturage, and of finest alluvial soil; and as to my sea-board, my Hawke’s Bay waters are as productive as my plains, for they abound in whales, more so than all the other shore waters of N. Zealand; and, while vessels have been wrecked both N. and S. of me, in my open roadstead a fine first-class ship has lain 9 weeks without once lifting her anchor, &amp;c., &amp;c.” No, no, Mr. Editor, Napier should never wish to shew the family likeness in this kind of way, and so vaunt herself like her elder sister Wellington. Again, among her town-land proprietors she has few or none really absentees; and no native reserves (to plague her) in the town; and therefore she needs not those stringently exceptional clauses. And, further, her population is very small, scarcely indeed amounting to the fractional number over the 3000 of Wellington; but then she is the youngest of the <hi rend="italic">nine</hi>, and if not as beautiful or as aspiring as <hi rend="italic">Urania</hi>, at all events is, and must be, the pet, because she is the nursling. Moreover, she is conscious that she has no timber yet handy (though plenty enough a little way off); and sometimes, after a sultry day or night, has certain fitful starts occasioned by an ugly visitant of a nightmare foretelling somewhat of a <hi rend="italic">water-rate</hi>. Further, more than two-thirds of the area included in the township of Napier was not only both surveyed and sold by Government as “<hi rend="italic">Suburban Land</hi>,” but also in large sections of from 5 to 9 acres each, with excellent hints from the then Crown Land Commissioner, Mr. Domett, as to their being “beneficially occupied as paddocks and gardens.” Now all this is utterly at variance with such Clauses as 70 and 80 of this Act, which, if received by us, would go well-nigh towards the totally prohibiting the keeping either a horse or a cow upon any of those suburban sections, and, consequently, against their beneficial occupation, seeing they are wholly <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the town. And, in fact, our Bench of Magistrates (when considering the issuing and renewal of Publicans’ Licences, on the same day in which the Sheriff held his Meeting for the election of Street and Sewerage Commissioners,) instead of making it imperative on each Publican to provide a 6-stalled stable, should rather have said, (acting up to both the spirit of the letter of the Wellington Act,)— “see that none of you allow a horse to be tethered upon your premises.” </p>
      <p>I have already (at the Meeting) remarked, on the great expense of the initiatory steps towards the carrying out of this Act, and therefore I need not to say anything more here under that head; other than merely again to call the attention of your readers to clauses 36, 37, 38, 39, 49 and 51.—I trust, that what I have both said and written will tend clearly to shew the utter incongruity of such an Act as this with the present wants and interests of the town of Napier. </p>
      <p>I come now to my 3rd and principal consideration:—<hi rend="italic">What is really needed? and how such, may the better he obtained</hi>. And here speaking of the present <hi rend="italic">real wants</hi> of Napier, (with exclusive reference to the above mentioned Act,) we must also keep in mind our present resources. Now I humbly conceive, that, the putting the marshy part of Carlisle Street in a condition fit for the passing of wheel-carriages,—the metalling Shakespeare gulley,—and the improving the Beach road on to the Pilot Station, are the Street improvements primarily needed. Those seem to be the points, in the way of Street-making, which more immediately call for energetic aid. As to Sewerage and Drainage, let all thought of such for the present, be scattered to the winds. It will, I think, he quite time enough to consider such when Napier like “Wellington shall have passed through 15 years of being; or, at all events, when the proprietors of her salt-water lagoon sections shall have set the powerful and needful example of improving them. For, at present (referring for a moment to the said Wellington Act,) it is, as if an arithmetical problem was given:—<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> If the exhalation arising from “1 ton of stable-dung” causes in “7 days” so much nuisance; how much is caused by that arising from 30 acres of putrid salt-water lagoons in the same time? But, whether present or future, it cannot for a moment be supposed, that a rate could ever be levied on the Town of Napier for the draining of those <hi rend="italic">Swamp</hi> Sections, or even for making the Streets running through them. For it must not be forgotten that those swamp <hi rend="italic">Town</hi> Sections were laid out of a larger size (some even being 2 acres,) and sold at a <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> price by the Government simply because they were under water, and that whoever purchased them would have to make an outlay in order to make them of any service. Hence we had (for example) No. 291, ½ an acre, offered at £5, while its next neighbour, No. 276, containing 2 acres, was offered at £2. 10s. 0. </p>
      <p>I think, Sir, that most of the land-owners and residents in Napier will fully agree with me as to the streets needing immediate aid; in fact, I might, truly enough say <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, if some would but think less of their own isolated private, and more of the public interest. And now it remains to be considered how such needful aids may the better be obtained; or, in other words, the <hi rend="italic">Ways and means</hi>. </p>
      <p>1st <hi rend="italic">As to the Ways</hi>:—let them be simple, suitable, and just. Simple, so as to be plain and easy; without stilts, or puffing, or mock display; and without needless expense in the matter of several paid officers or servants:—<hi rend="italic">Suitable</hi>, so as to be always adequate to the wants of the rising town:—and <hi rend="italic">just</hi>; so as every one residing, or holding property, in Napier, shall (<hi rend="italic">if really needed</hi>) pay his fair quota towards improvements. Now, all this, I think, may be very properly and inexpensively performed by a Local Public Board; or, if they should need any extension of powers, such could very easily be obtained or, a plain Bill, framed on the broad basis of the foregoing conditions, might be duly considered and drawn, and be presented by our Members at the next Meeting of the Provincial Council. </p>
      <p>2nd <hi rend="italic">As to the Means</hi>:—not merely for the present (stated) occasion, but for the continual and growing wants of the town. And here, Mr. Editor, I would lay down the following suggestions for Public Consideration:—</p>
      <p>1. That proper measures be taken in order to secure to the town of Napier, and for the sole benefit and improvement thereof, the unreclaimed and unsold lands of the harbour. </p>
      <p>2. That, failing in the above, suitable aid be sought from Government towards the making the Streets and Roads of the said town—</p>
      <p>3. That should Government refuse, or only partially assist, an easy Rate be duly levied on all Landed property in the town of Napier.—</p>
      <p>4. That the rate be not uniform; with respect to the <hi rend="italic">situation</hi> of land.—</p>
      <p>5. That the rate be upon the broad principle of benefits derived, or derivable, from Street improvements; and, therefore, be somewhat as follows:—     <lb/>(a) For all Land whether occupied or not.  <lb/>(b) For all uninhabited houses, and for ground in profitable occupation.   <lb/>(c) For or on account of all traffic, or income arising from the same.     <lb/>(d) For all horses and carriages using such made and improved roads.—</p>
      <p>6. That <hi rend="italic">Gough Island</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Meanee Spit</hi> be included. </p>
      <p>7. That the Town be divided into suitable wards. </p>
      <p>8. That one ward be not (generally) rateable for the improvements of another.—</p>
      <p>9. That one local Board, and one sworn valuer be for the whole.—</p>
      <p>10. That no unoccupied Land, or any belonging to any absentee, be distressable or saleable, for Rates.—</p>
      <p>11. That appeal be allowed. </p>
      <p>12. That the Board be annually chosen at a Public Meeting, and by ballot. </p>
      <p>13. That all their accounts be annually and publicly audited.—Although I have gone so far as to propose a rate, it is wholly as a last resource; for nothing ought possibly to be farther from Napier, and indeed from the whole Colony of N. Zealand than a thing so hateful as taxation—the curse of Britain! to escape which we have even consented to expatriate ourselves from the homes and hearths of our sires.—</p>
      <p>Now I sincerely hope, that the majority of your readers, being owners of land, or residents, in Napier, will give the foregoing suggestions attentive consideration; being prepared thereto by a strong determination to uphold that which is simple <hi rend="italic">suitable and just</hi>.—and that too when the silver-loving side of the soul whispers, that to do so would be to act against one’s own darling private interests. </p>
      <p>                       I am,  Sir,</p>
      <p>                               Yours very truly,</p>
      <p>
        <hi rend="smallcaps">Wm. Colenso. </hi>
      </p>
      <p>P.S. I have still a few words to say (in connection with the foregoing), and which I had quite intended to have said now; but as I have already exceeded all due bounds, I must leave the doing so till next week.                     —W.C.</p>
