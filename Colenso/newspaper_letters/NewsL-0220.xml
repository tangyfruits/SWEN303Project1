      <p rend="justify">The Rev. W. Colenso, F.R.S., F.L.S., one of New Zealandâ€™s earliest settlers, died this week at Napier, aged 88. He introduced to New Zealand the first printing press, which was landed at the Bay of Islands on January 3, 1835. He was a devoted student of science and probably the best Maori scholar and antiquarian in New Zealand. He left several charitable bequests. </p>
