         <p>TO HIS HONOR DONALD M‘LEAN, ESQ.,	<lb/>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">superintendent of Hawke’s bay.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Nearly 20 years ago, I asked a prinicipal Maori chief of these parts, (a man well known to you though now dead,)— “What he considered to be the duty of a chief towards his tribe?” Of course, our views differed greatly: he believed that a chief was bound to get all he could for <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>; while I thought, he should seek the greatest amount of good for <hi rend="italic">his people</hi>.</p>
         <p>Pardon me, Sir, when I say, that, of late, this old question has again popped up;—not, however, now with reference to a New Zealand Maori chief, but with especial reference to yourself, as our chief Magistrate and present Superintendent of this Province,—and I am again obliged to fall back upon my old supposition, viz, that <hi rend="smallcaps">a chief</hi> (whether hereditary or elected) <hi rend="smallcaps">should ever</hi> 
            <hi rend="smallcaps">seek the greatest amount of good for his people</hi>: I trust you will fully agree with me in this.</p>
         <p>We are now in the midst of a general election for the House of Representatives. You know, Sir, that I have served the Town and Electoral District of Napier as its member during the past five years. I recollect well certain conversations you and I have had at various times within that period, concerning some of the business done in the General Assembly and my close attendance there, in which you (as a Hawke’s Bay landholder) highly approved of my conduct. This fact, coupled with my belief of your Honor’s duty to the Province (as intimated above),—not to mention our long acquaintance,—would have quite led me to expect <hi rend="italic">your</hi> coming forward on the approaching nomination day (as an elector) to nominate <hi rend="smallcaps">me</hi> for re-election,—had it not been for a “Requisition”<note xml:id="ftn25" place="foot" n="25"> I have been unable to find copies of the <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> for 1866, so cannot explain this reference—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
            </note> which has appeared in the ‘Herald.’</p>
         <p>And here I may remark, Sir, (while I honestly avow my conviction, that the least now said about that unhappy “Requisition” the better for all parties who were therein <hi rend="italic">actively</hi> concerned,)— that if, on the prorogation of the Genera1 Assembly or on its subsequent dissolution, a Requisition, fairly and openly got up and plainly speaking its true meaning, had been presented to you signed by <hi rend="italic">only half of the number</hi> whose names appear on the present one, I should hesitate long ere I could bring myself to consent to contest the present election with you, notwithstanding my prior and reasonable claim. </p>
         <p>But as we well know that such has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been the case, and as I wish you, Sir, to do the utmost amount of good for the people of this Province, of which you are officially the present head, I therefore ask you to consider this letter, and (under all the circumstances) to withdraw from the contest, and to come forward on the day of nomination—like a good chief and just and honest Superintendent—and propose me, the old and tried servant of the people and of the Province, for re-election, and so both avoid an unseemly and unnecessary contest, and strengthen the hands of the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> member for Napier in the General Assembly.</p>
         <p>Do not, however, misunderstand me, as if I herein asserted or insinuated my better ability; such is not the case. I ground my claim (as against you, Sir,) upon three things,—1. My long and faithful service,—2. My acquired knowledge of the work, and—3. By having plenty of spare time (to which I might also fairly add, my having assisted in putting-in the present Stafford Ministry.)</p>
         <p>I confess, too, to a feeling which I have, that (though I wish myself to be returned, believing I should again, as heretofore, faithfully and usefully serve our Province,) I should not like to see you (<hi rend="italic">as our Superintendent</hi>) beaten:—some, however, may call this a <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi> on my part. I well know that you cannot depend on the names to the printed “Requisition” as <hi rend="italic">against myself;</hi> obtained too, as very many of them were, through misrepresentations, and <hi rend="italic">at a time too when a far different Ministry was in place</hi>; and I know by eperience the great difference that there is in the weight of any member the House when he is merely a member and not a member by law, but not a Representative willingly elected by the united votes of a free people.</p>
         <p>No doubt had I carried in the General Assembly what I strove hard to do,—to have <hi rend="italic">another member </hi>granted to us for Hawke;s Bay, (making our number of members equal to that of Taranaki; a smaller Province,) then, Sir, we might have stood together before the electors at the approaching election. </p>
         <p>Commending this to your earnest consideration, </p>
         <p> I am, Sir,</p>
         <p>		Yours very faithfully,</p>
         <p>			William Colenso</p>

         <p>The following letter, translated from the <hi rend="italic">Waka Maori</hi>, was written in reply to a letter from Hapi Kinihi, published in that paper (a translation of which was published in a former issue of the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>), asking for information relative to the Blight Bird. The translation has been kindly furnished us by the writer, who has added the postscript which will be found appended:— </p>
         <p>(To the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Waka Maori</hi>.)</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">Friend</hi>, — If you are agreeable, permit my letter to be printed in the <hi rend="italic">Waka Maori</hi>, as a reply to the enquiry of Hapi Kinihi; because his question was a proper one, and so indeed was all his letter. It would be well if the generality of maories were like him in that respect—to observe and search and enquire, that their knowledge might increase concerning the many works of the great Creator who made all things both small and great. </p>
         <p>Now that small bird, about which Hapi Kinihi enquired, is a real New Zealand bird; but originally came (to us) from the Middle Island, which is its native home. The southern maories call it <hi rend="italic">kanohi mowhiti</hi>; (ring-eye); by others it is called <hi rend="italic">tauhou</hi> (stranger); while another of its maori names is <hi rend="italic">poporohe</hi>. In the Summer season this bird remains in the hill forests to lay its eggs and rear its young; in the winter it comes down to the seaside to seek its food in the warmer parts. It was first seen here at Ahuriri in 1862; in my journey to Te Wairoa I saw it at Aropauanui, with its nest and young; there were four young ones in the nest which were nearly fledged, the Maories of that place took them from a thick shrub on the banks of the river. They told me that it was a new bird to them, they having first observed it there in the preceding year, 1861. </p>
         <p>The settlers at Wellington say, that this bird was first noticed there in the year 1856, when it flew across the Straits from the Middle Island. It suddenly appeared at Wellington, and not long after it just as suddenly disappeared. For three years it was absent altogether, after which it was seen again at Wellington, since when it has constantly resided both there and here, increasing rapidly in numbers. Its principal food is the scale ipsect (<hi rend="italic">coccus</hi> sp.) which so disgustingly and injuriously sticks to the peach trees, also to the <hi rend="italic">ngaio</hi> and other Maori trees. Hapi Kinihi describes correctly its gregarious habits, flying and consorting in flocks. I suppose there are a hundred, or even more, gathered together at this present time here in the trees in my garden. When they commence seeking their food, one of them remains as a sentinel on the topmost branch of a high tree, and if he sees a hawk or a sparrow-hawk flying, he utters a peculiar note, when all the little busy eaters immediately fly away without noise into the thick <hi rend="italic">koromiko</hi> shrubs to conceal themselves, where they remain as quiet as mice; and when the enemy is gone off the watchful little sentinel utters a different note, on which they all fly out of their concealment and recommence eating. Sometimes, though more rarely, they are also on the ground among the grass under the trees seeking insects, when the sentinel keeps a good look out, and warns them also of the approach of man! They have very good reason to dread their enemies — the sparrow-hawk in particular,—as one of these bold birds, (which has been too frequent of late in my garden) has been seen to catch and carry off no less than three of them; domestic cats also kill them too easily. </p>
         <p>It is also amusing to observe how dexterously this little bird strips off the scale insect from the branches, turning itself over and over, back downwards like an English tom-tit, peering under every twig and leaf and into every crack, so that nothing shall possibly escape him; sometimes 4, 6, or 8 of them will get on the top of a slender rose or chrysanthemum bush in the sun; and enjoy themselves in swaying it to and fro, or in pulling out the chaff of the dead chrysanthemum flowers,—just as fast as an English goldfinch does the thistle down. When they retire to roost they sleep in pairs, cuddling quite close together like love-parrots; and before they fold their heads under their wings they bill and preen each others head and neck most lovingly, uttering at the same time a gentle twittering note. </p>
         <p>There are also some other species, of this bird (<hi rend="italic">zosterops</hi> genus,) varying slightly from this one, found in the small Islands of this ocean lying to the N.W. of  New Zealand, viz., in Norfolk Island, and in Lord Howe’s Island.</p>
         <p>	I am, &amp;c,</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">	W. Colenso</hi>. </p>
         <p> Napier, July 7, 1867.</p>
         <p>[It may here be stated, that the writer of the foregoing would long ago have written in English for publication in the newspapers what he knew of this little bird (Ring-eye), had he not from time to time noticed in several colonial papers the most strange assertions concerning it. In one paper it was said to be “the English linnet!” in another, the Acclimatisation Societies (of the moon or elsewhere,—not however stated,) were roundly thanked for introducing it!! in another it was said to have migrated “hither from Australia,—and so on. None enquired (like the Maori Hapi Kinihi), all asserted,—more or less of error!] </p>
