         <p>No. 12.—<hi rend="smallcaps">Substances</hi>. </p>
         <p>My last was on shadows—unrealities: this shall be on substances—reality. Yes: men of the province of Hawke! on what I deem to be real; although its true utility and value will be more surely known to, and proved by, a generation yet to come.—</p>
         <p>I have not seen, I may not see, 	<lb/>  My hopes for man take form in fact 	<lb/>But God will give the victory 	<lb/>  In due time;<hi rend="italic">in that faith I act</hi>. 	<lb/>And he who sees the future sure, 	<lb/>  The baffling present may endure, 	<lb/>And bless, meanwhile, the unseen Hand that leads 	<lb/>The heart’s desires beyond the healthy step of deeds.</p>
         <p>Mistake me not: value not substances according to their gross densities; otherwise Garry’s anvil will bear away the prize. There are various substances—from gold to gauze ribbon—from mutton fat to wool—from lead to magnesia—all of different specific weights and values; and there are still others—substances, that is, <hi rend="italic">realities</hi>, (as opposed to shadows, or unrealities,) which are both more subtil and more potent—such as, the electric fluid—the different gases we swallow in every draught of water—and the intellectual thinking part of man.—Would that every Briton clearly understood and valued his birthright! Would that every settler in this new province of Hawke rightly viewed the greatest two of all his realities—his religious and legal privileges! </p>
         <p>Of the former, that is of the religious, I shall not now speak (I hope to bye-and-bye); of the latter, that is, of his <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> privileges as a British colonist, I shall now essay a few words. </p>
         <p>It has been sneeringly asked by the opposite party; (who, by the way, have always opposed the dissemination of truth and light, and therefore have the least right of any to put such a question;) what right have I to write such <hi rend="italic">tracts</hi> ? The answer I leave for my many approving readers to make.* I say now, once for all, <hi rend="italic">I write as nature’s priest</hi>. Do not, however, mistake me: Man, as lord of the creation, is by birthright nature’s priest. But it is only to the patient, to the painstaking, to the humble, to the truthful seeker, that she reveals her store. Only such men unlock her treasures, and through them the world is enriched. To all others she is as hard as flint;—a perfect sphynx preserving an eternal silence. ‘<hi rend="italic">Know thyself</hi>,’ is her first lesson; and the man who cons this truly possesses the <hi rend="italic">sesame</hi>, or talisman, which ever gives him entrance to the hearts of his fellow men. I write, I speak from my heart, what I believe and feel; hence it is that I strike a chord in the hearts of the many. This is the only true way of writing, of speaking; <hi rend="italic">from the heart to the heart</hi>. Hence it is that the words in lovers’ letters seem to jump out of the paper and are always understood;—that love’s language is universal;—and that national proverbs and good ballads never fail to stir the inmost depths of man’s being. There is a spirit in man—in every man, even in a child—which immediately detects what is merely said as compliment, or flattery, or humbug, or to gain one’s own private ends;—and what is said in truthful simplicity from the depth of the soul. This latter always strikes home; it does not so much instruct or teach, as it finds a suitable spot in the soul, a seed already sown, a germ already waiting for the welcome ray or communication which is to evolve it. Such writing or speaking is living, is blood warm; it carries before it all barriers. It is man’s soul speaking to his fellow’s soul. “When I hear, or read, any such, I say, ‘Ah! there’s a living man; one who is like myself; one who has both laughed and wept, both experienced and felt.’ Yes: such an one lives for all, and all live in him.—</p>
         <p>Men of the province of Hawke! I have now a few words to say to you on your electoral privileges. If you all really knew the value of them, you would prize them more than you do. To me—looking forward as I do to a happier period for all freemen—they are realities; precious substances pregnant with good! more to be prized than gold or pearls. For such, poor humanity has been struggling many thousand years—struggling through seas of blood. For such, a great part of Europe is still heaving and swelling like the billows of the ocean. For man in power has ever striven to keep down his fellow-man, whether in Church or in State. </p>
         <p>Men of Napier! listen to one of your chosen members. Note the words of a man who has passed through much adversity—much contumely:—a man, composed of flesh and blood like yourselves:—a man, over whom both honours and wealth have now little power. Why? Because he has seen the hollowness of them, and has therefore been enabled to rise above them.—</p>
         <p>Men of Hawke! You have in your own possession a great privilege—a valuable <hi rend="italic">substance</hi>:—power. Prize it; use it rightfully for your own and your children’s good. I have looked anxiously over the list, published in the Hawke’s Bay Herald, of the persons who have newly qualified themselves as voters, and I confess I am disappointed;—there ought to have been three times the number. Oh! if you really knew the great value of the boon you have thought so little of:—of the boon, to gain which your forefathers laid down their lives, you—every soul of you who has not sent in his qualification as a voter would have acted differently. </p>
         <p>Men of Hawke! we have now Responsible Government—Representative Government of our own—and farther than this man cannot go towards perfection in the art of Government. But, bear in mind, that it is to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, to the electors, <hi rend="italic">to the basis</hi> of the pyramid, that we have ever to look for the soundness and perfectibility of the superstructure. This I call, substance, <hi rend="italic">reality</hi>: for, rightly used, your governing men cannot go greatly wrong. And, why so? Simply because the <hi rend="italic">power</hi>, the reality, is with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—with the many, with the Electors; so that, if your governing men or elected representatives go far astray the fault will ever be your own. Your representatives are merely your own mouth-pieces, speaking for you; therefore they ought not, and, if you use your power rightly, they can not, they dare not, do, what you would not have done.—</p>
         <p>This power, which you have legally and rightfully as men and as British colonists, you should prize highly; for by it alone when rightly used you both can and will have good Government. </p>
         <p>But, like all other good things, it must be <hi rend="italic">used</hi>; and to use it properly will require some little watchfulness on your part. If your chosen representatives dare to act irrespective of the welfare and wishes of those who chose them and sent them into the Provincial Council, call them immediately to account; spare them not. Pass not tamely over the first slip, or it may lead to greater and graver errors. </p>
         <p>Both history and experience tells us that the worst of tyranny has ever proceeded from a small elected body; when such have once kicked away the ladder by which they mounted, they become an unprincipled oligarchy, vastly more costly and overbearing than any one despot could possibly be.— </p>
         <p>I believe, and therefore publish, that no Representative of the people has any right to propose, or uphold, or vote for, any person or act or thing, which those who sent him into the Provincial Council would not approve of. And this I hold, because he is there only as their mouthpiece or organ, and therefore has no right to bring forward or advocate any peculiar or interested views of his own. </p>
         <p>For a young and newly-born Province we have a very fair and goodly revenue. See then that your representatives use it rightly, as you would reasonably have it used. And do you help them here; you have the Press both open and free; <hi rend="italic">use it</hi>. Give your thoughts life; let all good measures be brought forward, discussed, and well ventilated. Above all, see to it, that your available revenue is used for <hi rend="italic">the good of all</hi>; and that no <hi rend="italic">Class</hi>-interest is maintained and preserved at the expense of others. </p>
         <p>This, I call, substance—reality or true Government; when, the power, being with the people, that power is by them delegated to certain chosen Representatives who act honestly and rightly for the good ot all. </p>
         <p>A strong cart horse in a stable eating oats, and outside drawing a heavy load, is in very different positions; so also is our little steamer the <hi rend="italic">Wonga Wonga</hi>, when inactive in harbour, and when going against wind and tide: working for the good of the community, both are admired and both useful. Just so it is with your Representatives whom you have chosen and sent into the Provincial Council. It is you, Electors, who have called them into being; it is you who have given them power; it is you who have made them what they are: see to it, then, that they work for your good; otherwise call them to account. Let them see, that still with you is the <hi rend="italic">substance</hi>; that you have the power; for, by so acting, you will be very sure to have in due time good government—a blessing, which, more than half of the States of Christian Europe, and nine-tenths of the whole world, is still sighing and hoping and fighting for! </p>
         <p>At the same time be not captious: be not ever ready to find fault. Remember, that ‘good work requires time:’ and that your chosen men are, after all, only men (new chums it may be in political matters) and not angels. </p>
         <p>Men of Napier! you have heard me say, ‘I would not go fettered into the Provincial Council;’ and this is right, as a freeman speaking to freemen. I have also understood, that in your voting for me and sending me thither, it is to sit there as <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Representative—as <hi rend="italic">your</hi> organ, to make known <hi rend="italic">your</hi> wishes. If I cease to do so; or if I set aside yours for my own individual interests or designs, I then cease to be your Member, and you have a perfect and legal right to call upon me to resign; which call I must necessarily obey. Do you, also, Men of Hawke! act thus towards all your Representatives; and you will find, that you indeed possess a valuable substance—a reality—which thus used will be sure to bring you a valuable return. </p>
         <p>It is related of George III. that he once said, ‘He wished every man in his dominions could both read and possess the Scriptures:’ that was a good wish; it is a pity he did not do more towards effecting it. It is my wish, that every man in the Province shall be enrolled as a voter, and should know his privileges and duties as a voter; and towards this my aim shall ever be directed both in speaking and writing. </p>
         <p>Men of the Province of Hawke who are generally called ‘the working classes!’ Englishmen, Britons, Americans,—Sawyers, Shepherds, Servants—Settlers all, see that you claim and obtain and use your rights as voters; in so doing you will possess a reality—a substance—in common (it may be) with your present masters or employers. It is only in your so doing that you are their equals; it is only here that you shew yourselves to be men like themselves. When I think how many of you are still unqualified as voters, and how much some of you monthly spend in grog (at the present high rate of wages,) I confess I am grieved, at your want of thought. Would that every one of you would become a ‘teetotaller!’ until at least he should have laid by £20, which, as things are, will enable him to buy 40 acres of land, make him a voter, and as such equal with his master, give him a valuable and substantial right, and enable him bravely as a man to aid in forming a liberal and free Government, through which your newly-adopted country is to rise, and your children and descendants will be benefitted. </p>
