        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—When at Danevirke a short time ago I saw in your paper an advertisement announcing a Bazaar about to be held for the benefit of the Danevirke Brass Band, and among other wonders a cunning woman was to be brought there from Palmerston to tell fortunes by palmistry! However, it so happened, that the promoters of the Bazaar, on learning that such cheating as Palmistry was illegal, wisely caused it to be published in the following number of your Paper that Palmistry would not be allowed at the Bazaar; this was right. I have lately again, met with a recent case in the London papers, in which the brazen-faced prophetess or cheating-woman was severely punished for her palmistry. I extract this and send to you for insertion in your paper, that my good friends in the Bush district generally, (including the police), may know a little more about it, and how severely it is punished in England. At the same time I cannot shut my eyes to the fact, that you have there in Danevirke and its neighbourhood, far worse cheats, false prophets, and “fads” than this of palmistry.<note xml:id="ftn60" place="foot" n="60"> This is taken from a clipping of the letter (ATL MS-Copy-Micro-0485-1) on which Colenso wrote “the ‘fads’: Salvation Army! Mormonism!” —<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>

      <p>Sophia Robson <hi rend="italic">alias </hi>‘Madame Minerva,’ was charged at the Mansion House Police Court yesterday with having pretended to tell fortunes by means of palmistry. Mrs Whatley, a cook at the Cloak-lane Police Station, spoke to an interview with the prisoner at the instance of the police, and Mr Alderman Green, considering the case proved, inflicted a fine of ₤25, or a month’s imprisonment in default.</p>
