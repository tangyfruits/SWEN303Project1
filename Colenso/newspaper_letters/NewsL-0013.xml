      </p>
      <p>No. 2.—<hi rend="smallcaps">Janus</hi>. </p>
      <p>The ancient Romans worshipped many gods besides their full dozen of great celestial deities (<hi rend="italic">Dii majorum gentium</hi>). In religious ceremonies the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Janus</hi> was always first invoked: not because he belonged to the superior class (for he was one of the second batch, or selected gods—<hi rend="italic">Dii selecti</hi>), but because he presided over all gates and entrances, and it was through him only that prayers could reach the higher house. Moreover, Janus was represented with two faces looking two ways; and sometimes with the number 800 in one hand and with 65 in the other, to denote that he presided over the year—of which the first month (January) still bears his name. The native ornamented weapon (<hi rend="italic">taiaha</hi>), with its double face and four mother-of-pearl eyes and its useful native proverb, has always served to remind me of the old Roman Janus. </p>
      <p>Believe me, I am not going to invoke the aid of Janus, standing as we are on the threshold of a new (and it may be a mighty) era of good or ill for Ahuriri. It is, however, my desire to say a few words to my fellow-electors concerning some of the great-great-great-grandchildren of the old Roman Janus, who, in all probability, may shortly be expected to be scuttling about among us. For “the Derby day,” though of very brief duration and held on an open downs, might just as reasonably be supposed to pass unheeded by the numerous flash gentry ever on the look-out for chances, as for the approaching maiden general election of Ahuriri to be uncontested by some of the numerous descendants of double-faced Janus. Unfortunately, however, our modern Januses (that I offend not classical ears I must also say, <hi rend="italic">Jani</hi>,)—our modern Januses differ greatly from the old prototype in not carrying their distinguishing badge in their faces. Now-a-days the face is wholly one, (whether in conformity with the Lamarckian theory of development I shall not stop to examine;) while the heart is double. So that, in seven cases out of ten, the honest settler who has his bread to earn and his own and children’s fortunes to better,—and who has no greater liking for entertaining evil thoughts of his fellow-men than he has for sowing Dock seed or Sorrel on his land,—such a one, has really no time to spend in enquiry as to the truth of the statements of the modern Janus who is soliciting his vote. The elector hears him say, that his whole heart is bound up in the welfare of Ahuriri; and that through him (and his colleagues) the golden age will infallibly return. Looking only in his face and believing his words the elector gives him his vote: when soon Time (who, according to the Romans, was once Janus’ guest,) shows him his folly, and that instead of the golden—the leaden age is come, and has to be endured with all its vexatious disappointments and burdens as it best may. </p>
      <p>Let no elector ask, to have the different species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Janus</hi> pointed out. He must take the definition of the <hi rend="italic">Genus</hi>, and endeavour himself to find out the individual or species;—just as he would a cabbage an apple or a rose, of each of which there are very many kinds, and although new sorts are continually turning up yet there is no mistaking them,—no calling a rose a hollyhock, or an apple a cucumber. The genus Janus, then, inasmuch as it is <hi rend="italic">always developed late</hi>, is best known by a good, hard and sharp look-out after its antecedents, or old qualities and qualifications; just such, a common practical look-out, as a farmer exercises when seeking seed wheat, or it maybe a good cow or a horse; or, as when a blacksmith is seeking among iron, for a bit of steel for some particular purpose; or a shoemaker a skin of calf among cordovan. No known creature requires such a good looking after as the genus <hi rend="italic">Janus</hi>; owing to its duplex characters. In all its varieties it ever strives to make its dupes believe that it seeks their good and the welfare of the state; but, on the contrary, it seeks its own ends,—either in salaries or honours, in power or an easy billet, in carrying out the deep-laid schemes of selfish men, or pet projects of class policy;—and, like rust in steel, or blight in apple trees, once got in is scarcely ever eradicated. </p>
      <p>I remember, a few years ago meeting with a good and able article in the “Times,” in which the writer shewed, that while Nature in general intended every man for one thing in particular, for which she had also fitted him; the most of mankind strove to lay hold of two or more things, for which they were both unfitted and wholly unadapted, and hence a large measure of the misery in the world. </p>
      <p>Brother electors, keep a good look-out after this genus Janus; endeavour to detect it, though unblown its flower, unknown its fruit. And, the better to do so, be yourselves somewhat like old Janus—looking two ways; the one way backward, at the past public acts and actions and present characteristics of every one who may wish your vote; and the other way forward, at what you may (knowing the past and the present) reasonably expect from such a one. Keep your eyes open. Water does not rise above its level. “Beware of self-seeking politicians.”—</p>
