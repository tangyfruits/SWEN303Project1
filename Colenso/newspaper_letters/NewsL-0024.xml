         <p>No. 13.—<hi rend="smallcaps">See-saw.</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>Who has not, when a child, enjoyed a good game at see-saw? Pleasant indeed is the sport! so is its recollection, even when dimly viewed through a long avenue of 50 years! Pleasant also is it to notice how deftly the crack young see-sawer manages when the plank slips a little out or in; or when his playfellow is heavier or lighter than himself. Who can say, that at such a game nothing is learnt of the power of correlative forces? of contraries? of opposition? Who shall say, that his see-sawing ended with the days of his childhood? rather, say, that man goes see-sawing to the grave. Alas! the world is full of it: not merely man with man; or company with company—ever opposed, opposite, and antagonistic, the heavier struggling hard to retain his filched piece of the plank, and enjoying but the fears and screams of his uptilted opposite—class-interest with class-intererst, and state with state. Worse still! in no place is there a more determined see-saw game played than in the United States Congress, or in the British House of Commons!! Is not this sad? Yes: very, to the superficial observer; to the hoodwinked stiff-and-starched one-idea conventionalist; but not so to the truthful student of nature—to him who looks more than skin-deep into things. </p>
         <p>It has more than once occurred to me, that a by no means unuseful essay might be written on Governmental see-sawing—opposites, or <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi>. It is certainly a fact, that the more civilised or free any people or state has ever been, the more loftily and lengthily they dared to see-saw, or to oppose each other, and to “talk the matter over.” Not but that both uncivilised and servile peoples have also talked; but such has ever been all form and ceremony, unmeaning palaver and twaddle, the mere animal following of the pack after their leader. Only a free people could produce such opposition—only a free people could hear such orations as those of Cicero and Demosthenes,—of Pitt and of Sheridan, of Burke, of Brougham, and of Bright. Yes: here is a good subject for a deep and lengthened study:—<hi rend="smallcaps">Opposition</hi>;<hi rend="italic"> its naturalness; its need; and its wholesome tendency</hi>. </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Opposition</hi>! this word, to some, sounds akin to ghost, or vampire, or some other horrible phantasy. Especially to the superficialist. Let him only hear of opposition, and anon he thinks of tartarus and the devil and his children! No doubt the word is both ambiguous and abused;—but so is the Polynesian word <hi rend="italic">tapu</hi>, and the Latin word <hi rend="italic">sacer</hi>, and our common English words, god, pound, knave, &amp;c.; such equivocal words occur in all languages. But, undoubtedly, there is a sound proper good and beneficial opposition, as well as a factious and evil one. It strikes me, that (strange as it may sound,) opposition will be found to be one of the greatest physical conservators of nature;—her main-compensating power, or balance-wheel. And even morally, (to rise no higher,) no man possessing a sane mind and capable of deep reflection, will dare say, that he is not indebted to his failings for his being a wiser or a better man. </p>
         <p>My axiom, then, is, that <hi rend="italic">opposition is natural</hi>: as old Pindar also hath it (<hi rend="italic">Olymp. IX.,</hi>) </p>
         <p>“All that is natural <hi rend="italic">is best</hi>.” </p>
         <p>Look, “around, above, beneath;”—from the highest to the lowest, from the biggest to the smallest, all nature is full of <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi>; and that, too, for the best purposes—Life, Harmony, Order. Consider the heavens, with their innumerable suns, planets and stars, all ever-whirling with astonishing rapidity, all performing their different motions,—</p>
         <p>“Cycle in epicyle, orb in orb,”—</p>
         <p>more correctly than the best chronometer, and (as far as we know) only doing so through <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi>—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> their equal though vast centrifugal and centripetal (or giving-out and pulling-in) powers. Observe, also, another great (though still imperfectly known) natural agent, Electricity, (only recently pressed into the service of man,) consider, again, its own two great elements of <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi>, in its negative and positive (or attracting and repelling) natures! Glance at the Animal kingdom; mark well the beautiful contrivances of diastole and systole, or the dilation and contraction of the heart; by which continual <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi> life is preserved! View the Vegetable kingdom; notice the two currents of sap and their opposite circulation in the living plant, always ascending and descending! And then contemplate the wise <hi rend="italic">oppositian</hi> through which the two great kingdoms of nature are maintained—the one (vegetables) giving-out oxygen and taking-in carbonic acid, the other (animals, whether living or dead) taking-in oxygen and giving out carbonic acid. Hence the perfect adaptation of the two great kingdoms of living beings to each other;—each removing from the atmosphere what would be noxious to the other;—each yielding to the atmosphere what is essential to the continued existence of the other. </p>
         <p>Thus we may see, throughout physical nature,—the naturalness, the need, and the wholesome tendency of <hi rend="italic">opposing</hi> powers, or of <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi>. Happy if, in so reviewing, we shall be led up through nature unto nature’s Author:—</p>
         <p>“Nature is but a name for an effect 	<lb/>Whose cause is God:”—</p>
         <p>and with him of old, admiringly say,— “O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in wisdom thou hast made them all!”—– </p>
         <p>Nor is such less clearly seen by the philosophic mind in the moral world. No doubt, much of what we have of Truth, Justice, and Religion, is mainly owing to this great conservative power—<hi rend="italic">Opposition</hi>: As I take it, it is through this eternal (and apparently discordant) clashing, that Truth now and then emerges from her well;—that Justice and Rights-of-Man are sometimes allowed successfully to plead;—that Religion, not excluding Revelation, is maintained pure simple and unsophisticated. How very much christianity, in the midst of so many and so widely differing vagaries and follies and high-culminating worldly-wisdoms, is indebted to opposition; and that too among her best bodies of followers, He who is her Author alone knows! </p>
         <p>And thus, even as we know opposition to be needful and wholesome in animate and inanimate nature, in the physical moral and religious worlds, even so is it in the Governing Economy, or Politics, of States and Provinces. But here we should learn to discriminate between that opposition which is really useful and good, and that which is factious and vile. For, as I said before, the word is ambiguous; and every good has its counterfeit. And, 1st., Men of Hawke! know, (and knowing, prize and store, and <hi rend="italic">use, when the time comes,</hi> )—know that all <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi> which is, or has been, or may be, made against the Governing body, (or Supreme governing man,) is not necessarily factious and evil. When the Governing body, or Supreme governing man, (as the case may be,) goes wrong—when that body, or man, ceases to act for the good of the people, then opposition is a virtue and a necessary end, and, at such a time, it is <hi rend="smallcaps">not</hi> the <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi>, or opposing power, which is factious and disorderly, whether from many or few, but the false governing one in opposing the Public good. The time is for ever gone, when the doctrine of non-resistance, or “Kings (or governments) can do no wrong,” can be any longer taught to Englishmen—whether in Old England or in the Colonies. How very much of the miseries under which poor humanity has long groaned may be fairly carried to the account of the belief in that dogma, I scarcely dare trust myself to think, much less to say. </p>
         <p>And, 2nd., be assured that, the more highly civilised and free we are, the more needful and abounding opposition will be. For Human Nature fully developed is just as a chance pumpkin or corn plant, growing on a dunghill or highly manured lot of ground—the richer the soil the more of leaves and stem besides the fruit. The more clever and bold some intellects may be to devise well-concocted schemes of seeming good, the more certain some others equally gifted will arise, to enquire into and sift and scrutinise; and out of this see-sawing, or <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi>, good must ever to freemen eventually come. The man of trained, or well-disciplined mind, will always be careful what he takes for granted, and in nothing more so than in political schemes of seeming good. That opposition, however, is ever good, come from what quarter it may, which is beneficial to the Province and people;—even if those laws and measures which are known to be theoretically good are set aside through it. For liberty consists not in being governed by the laws which are absolutely best, but by those which are deemed best by the people who have to obey them.—</p>
         <p>And, 3rdly., Men of Hawke! from what has already been said, learn to discriminate and detect the really factious and evil opposition. Consider, capacities,—bias,—principles—motives—interests—tendencies. Shallow and prejudiced minds are like bad-sighted and fearful folks; such cannot see either a rock or a whale ahead, and will never venture out of their depth without their old corks or bladders; such will always be sure to raise an incessant cackle of factious opposition. Types of this class may be not seldom found in some thickset sturdy individual on juries committees and vestries. Selfish individual motives and principles are also mostly factious; so are class or party, or monopolising interests, where the many are called on to suffer to benefit the few; so is that opposition which is sometimes organised in order to delay, seeing it cannot hinder, the coming good, and which is too often elaborately and finely clothed with specious phraseology. And a pretty common mark, by which all such may be generally known, is that of a cat-like acting, or secrecy;—secret meetings, secret plans, secret and stealthy steps. Now all such is truly a factious and evil opposition; whether it proceeds from the ruler, ruling body, or ruled. </p>
