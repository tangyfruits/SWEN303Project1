                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your paper of yesterday, under the heading of “Napier Municipal Council,” you state, that at the meeting of the Council on last Wednesday night, a letter from the Sydney Exhibition Commissionors was read, containing a list of awards to Exhibitors in this district; and that among them you have— </p>
         <p>“W. Colenso, Early Printed Books and <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>; fourth degree of merit.”</p>
         <p>As this sentence “Early Printed Books”—does not inform your reader as to what those Books were, (and as some, by their enquiries, have already supposed them to mean ancient European ones,) I send you the list of them, hereto annexed, taken from the “Official Catalogue,” by which you will know they were all our own home work, being the first printed in New Zealand. Perhaps you may kindly find room for the said little list, together with this letter, in a corner of your paper.</p>
         <p>If I had more time to spare and you space, I should be tempted to say a little on the relative awards of “merit,” as published by you; if only to point out the great value in the eyes of those Sydney Jurors of “a picture of sea-weed” over No. 1 of my little lot! Our Colonial Jurors, however, at the N.Z. Exhibition in 1866, did not think so.—I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your issue of this morning, you state (in referring to a meeting of the Committee of the Athenæum held on Friday night) — “A lengthy communication was read from Mr W. Colenso, taking exception to smoking being allowed in the conversation room.” And, as there is at least one material error contained in that short sentence, allow me to correct it. </p>
         <p>My letter was not against all or any smoking being allowed in the conversation room—very far from it. Had I so written, I should myself have done the very (selfish) thing I had so prominently found fault with in my letter. What I had asked for (in that letter), viz., that the morning hours should be allotted for the ladies and the non-smoking members—the committee has reasonably granted. </p>
         <p>You call my letter “a lengthy communication.” What grounds have you for so saying? “Lengthy,” as compared with what? I know it was written on a single small sheet of note-paper, and my hand-writing is not particularly small. I do not know if you had any reporter present, (from the tenor of your item of information I should infer you had not). Two lines on a postal card might prove to be a “lengthy communication” with even a Lilliputian Senate! </p>
         <p>I should not care to notice your error at all, had I not written on behalf of the public, and for the benefit of the members, and also of the Athenæum. — I am, &amp;c.,</p>

         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I have been greatly pained in seeing a most glaring political error in the H.B. Herald of this morning. I would write to the Editor about it (living so near him), but I know too well from past experience it is no use to do so! I, therefore, address you, looking at the matter as being of great public interest, and not merely so, but of importance, too, towards the keeping of the future peace of the colony (as between its two chief races). The error itself, in its brief telegraphic original, is but small, comparatively; not so, however, the expansion and perversion of it by the editor of the Herald, who has used it as a text for a long unpleasant and disloya1 sub-article, which I deeply regret to see.</p>
         <p>It appears that Captain Knollys, the Governor’s aide-de-camp, had just visited the chief Te Whiti officially, bearing a peaceful message from His Excellency offering to meet him, Te Whiti; to which Te Whiti replied, “Tu a maoa te tawa.” </p>
         <p>His answer, the Herald says, means, “The potatoes were cooked;” [Oh! thou gross quintessence of stupidity!] and thereapon falls to, tooth and nail, and comes out startlingly——worthy of a credulous disciple of Mother Shipton!</p>
         <p>Now, if Te Whiti’s brief and oracular reply to Captain Knollys is reported correctly (is to Maori orthography)—and I suppose it is, seeing that it is good grammatical Maori, a complete sentence in itself, and pregnant with deep and suitable meaning—then its grammatical, and proper rendering would be, “The hard tawa fruit (like a plum) is fast ripening;” while the true figurative meaning (as I take it) would be “Our difficulties are quietly growing towards (or nearly advanced to) a settlement.” We have a similar English saying— “When the pear is ripe,” &amp;c.</p>
         <p>The tawa tree is one of the large N.Z. forest trees; its stone-fruit (one of the few big indigenous fruits) is a long time slowly growing and ripening; and it is often used in their old proverbs. (See Ext. in one of my last papers on the ancient Maoris, in “Transactions N.Z. Institute,” vol. XII., p.138.</p>
         <p>I can only earnestly hope that there are far better Maori interpreters and truer commentators to be found at Wellington than those of the H.B. Herald; and I would not now care to trouble you, to expose the blunder in translation, were it not for the editor’s ill-timed comment or perversion thereof.—I am, &amp;c.,</p>
