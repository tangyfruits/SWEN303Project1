         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I am just returned from Woodville and as I find your little town has had another visit from players, I cannot help thinking that Danevirke is very fond of games, plays, charades, and amusements of all kinds.</p>
         <p>I am about returning to Napier, and the Prince of Wales’ birthday is close at hand, with Father Christmas not far off; and as I shall not be here then I am tempted to offer a mite of amusement (for those who have cut their wisdom teeth!) in two short plays: One a Comedy, and one a Tragedy.</p>
         <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Comedy</hi>: “<hi rend="italic">Every man in his own humour</hi>.”</p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Act </hi>1.—Concerning mice, or a mouse; that is, what the ancients thought or said of a mouse.</p>
         <p>Once on a time the mountains (like Ruahine, near Danevirke) were sending forth awful noises, hollow groans. The people of the township were terrified, appalled, and fell on their knees through fear, invoking the aid of their Gods. When, lo! out crept a mouse from a crack in the side of the cavern in the mountain; and then it was known what caused those dreadful sounds—only a ridiculous mouse!</p>
         <p>Again, the great Greek poet Homer, has a famous tale (which has often made me to laugh heartily), called, the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, which dreadful pitched battle lasted till sundown, and prodigies of valour were performed by the combatants on both sides. Now, of one of those Mice, Homer says, “He was more a Mars in armour than a mouse, and <hi rend="italic">Meridarpax</hi> his resounding name.” What a valiant mouse that must have been! Ugh! It makes one shudder to think of it. How the poor frogs must have scuttled away, and dived into their deep dark pools before him! Seeing him stand up to the fight with a long reed spear, which, to their terrified imagination, was like “a weaver’s beam,” or a <hi rend="italic">draper’s</hi> yardstick. </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> 2.—Concerning charades, puns or plays on words.  </p>
         <p>Our British poet Cowper, in his laughable poem “The Jack-<hi rend="italic">daw</hi>” says of him— </p>
         <p>“He sees that this great roundabout, 	<lb/>The world with all its motley rout, 	<lb/>Its customs and its businesses; 	<lb/>Is no concern at all of his, 	<lb/>And says—What says he?<hi rend="italic">Caw</hi>.” </p>
         <p>While here in your paper of this day you have told us bow our good and able man of the <hi rend="italic">Law</hi> “eloquently addressed the Court.” And here, also, in our living fences, we have that pretty, highly-esteemed English shrub, commonly called “May,” now coming into full bloom, which, with its delightful scent and its fresh, bright green leaves, pleasingly serve to remind us all of our Fatherland. This shrub is also called the Whitethorp, and the <hi rend="italic">Haw</hi>-thorn (and its berries Haws), so that he that runs may read those four words of one syllable— Daw, Caw, Law, and <hi rend="italic">Haw</hi>— all rhyming so fittingly. Shall I say, one of these short words form half of my blundering charade? </p>
         <p>In Woodville this morning I picked up a pin, and in so doing my thoughts went off at a tangent to consider the thousands of <hi rend="italic">pins</hi> that were daily lost; and this led me to consider the thousand-and-one kerosene <hi rend="italic">tins</hi>; what can become of them? From tins my rhyming faculty went on to <hi rend="italic">wins</hi> (I suppose from having seen so much of that word of late in the reports of races), and then the transition to sins followed as a matter of course; and in passing by Thomas’ fine butcher’s shop I noticed a rare lot of sausages in <hi rend="italic">skins</hi>. Now, these five little words, each of one short syllable, rhyme excellently well, and one, or fourth-fifths of one, of them will have to be joined to the t’other half (above) to make out my charade. And I fancy some clever Danevirkian will be able to do it, and so find “the interpretation thereof.” </p>
         <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Tragedy</hi>: <hi rend="italic">“A Warning to liars.”</hi> 
               </p>
         <p>And as I am leaving you, Mr Editor, for a short season, and have my pen in hand, and an hour to spare, I may as well briefly notice the letter of “Old Ratepayer” in your paper of this day, in reply (he says) to mine. Not, however, that I am thinking of killing two birds with one stone. No! No! I am not going to remark on all his low tarradiddle vulgar, ill-arranged talk. I shall merely quote his own words to put him down. In his first letter of October 28th he said:— “In our streets on weekdays and Sundays alike, in the morning, at noon, and at night, we can see poor unfortunates robbed of manhood and respectability tottering along to a drunkard’s grave.” (And that was all of it that I took up, and denied, saying,— “the fitting reply to this calumniator, this defamer of your rising and quiet township, would be in an English word of three letters,—it is a <hi rend="italic">lie</hi>, or thou art a <hi rend="italic">liar</hi>, aye, and a big one too.”) Now, in his present letter, he endeavours to tone that infamous lying sentence down, (as if ashamed of it himself—perhaps through some of his older, wiser, and better-informed friends, but still not manly enough to acknowledge his great error,) saying,— “Mr Colenso calls me a liar for stating that drunkards may daily be seen in our streets. I do not intend to say anything in proof of my assertion.” Nothing in my estimation is worse than the low, mean, base, and cunning attempt to shuffle out of a lie, or to strive to prop it up;—that true old English Divine, G. Herbert, truly says,— </p>
         <p>“Dare to be true, nothing can need a lie, 	<lb/>A fault which needs it most grows two thereby.”</p>
         <p>All of us, I fear, are, at least now and then found tripping, and so uttering a lie,—often done in hasty speaking; some of them are cunningly termed “white lies;” but notwithstanding all that can be said in their behalf such lies are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> “white.” </p>
         <p>Moreover, he again, and now deliberately, styles himself “<hi rend="italic">Old</hi> Ratepayer” Is not this also a <hi rend="italic">lie</hi>? I will not say he has never paid any rates, but I dare say he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an “<hi rend="italic">Old</hi> Ratepayer,” and challenge him to prove it. </p>
         <p>Here, in a sheep-breeding, pig-rearing country, we may daily see the effects of crossing between two strains, or classes of a pair of each kind of those animals; and it has often occurred to me (bearing in mind what one daily sees in all our papers)—that the greatest lie, or rather the greatest power or faculty of lying, is to be found in the moral cross between a “Teetotaller” and a “Draper”! they each seem born or reared to it; and so in time become hardened, and get to say strange and false things; yet, possibly, believing them to be true! At all events never once feeling the slightest uneasiness,—never knowing the faintest qualm of conscience about them! Young, our British poet, says (in his “Night thoughts”),</p>
         <p>“Men may live fools but fools they cannot die.”</p>
         <p>But I, in my long and varied experience, have seen the error of that saying; for men too often, alas! die with a lie in their right hand. </p>
         <p>Some of those deluded infatuated creatures are almost always having a dig at the poor drunkard, as the lowest of the low, the worst of the worst. But I would again venture to remind them, that it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> said of the drunkard, but of “<hi rend="italic">all liars</hi> their part shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone”: and again repeated,— “Without the holy city are the dogs, and <hi rend="italic">everyone that loveth and maketh a lie.</hi>” (Rev. XXII.)</p>
         <p>“Old Ratepayer” says,— “If he writes again, he shall certainly put his name to it.” O dear me!, what a boon! what a concession! what a gift to Danevirke! Why, Mon, it is well-known already! </p>
         <p>Methinks, here, on reading this, some one may say,— “And now, what is the upshot of all this?” “What?” I reply: “Why the carrying out of the ancient Oriental Proverb,— ‘Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.’”</p>
         <p>In conclusion, I would apologise, Mr Editor, for the great length of this letter; but it contains two plays (fitted for the times), and I shall not again trouble you as I am leaving the Bush; at the same time I may say that I shall not follow the sainted Westlake (<hi rend="italic">Draper</hi>, &amp;c.) to San Francisco.—I am, &amp;c., </p>

         <p> Danevirke, November 4th, 1890.<note xml:id="ftn55" place="foot" n="55"> Colenso wrote to RC Harding (12 November 1890), “I note yr. saying you need an interpr. for my last (?) letter in “Bush Advoc”. This surprises me—at all events, it was &amp; is well understood there. Haw-kins is the name of the saucy forward young Australian draper (or cheap John) and it was purposely written in that way (on my return to D. from W.) to raise a laugh as well as to remind him of serious things, for he poses as a religious man of first water!!—to me, it is “unstable water” &amp;c. formerly he was w. the Methodists.” —<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>

               </p>
         <p>Sir,—A fortnight ago, while residing at Dannevirke in the 40-Mile-Bush, a friend at Wellington kindly sent me a copy fo your paper of Octr. 24<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>., containing “interesting reminiscences” of “an old identity”—Mr. Ebenezer Baker. On reading it I was impressed with the large number of semi-historical errors it contained; and this impression was shortly afterwards increased, on my receiving from Woodville, a copy of another Wellington paper, the “Evening Post” of Octr. 27<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>, containing that same “notice” somewhat abbreviated, scored with red crosses,—and the question put, “What do you think of this?” No doubt, those copies of two Wellington papers had been sent to me owing to my pamphlet containing the authentic account of “the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi,” (written by me at the time,) having lately been published by the Government on the Jubilee Commemoration. Being fully conversant with all that is mentioned, or touched on, in your “interesting remembrances,” I should have corrected them and replied at the time, only I considered, that as I was soon to return to Napier, I could better do so from documentary evidence in my possession.</p>
         <p>And here I would observe,—that I now write only in the cause of historical truth; and that with a perfect knowledge of all those various events and matters given in your sketch of Mr. E. Baker, and of the public circumstances of those early times. Mr. Baker’s father and myself were friends; we lived side-by-side at Paihia Mission Station for many years, and there, on my landing from England in 1834, I first saw the subject of your notice—a little curly-haired boy of 4 years. Yet, while I mention this, I must also add the Ciceronic maxim,— “<hi rend="italic">Amicus Plato, amicus Socrates, sed magis amica veritas</hi>.” And, although it is possible (if Mr. E. Baker really gave your reporter all that is there stated, which I greatly doubt,) that I may not please Mr. Baker in these corrections and remarks, I will nevertheless take good care that “nothing extenuate nor ought of malice” shall be “set down” by me in this letter.</p>
         <p>1. I demur to your statement, that Mr. E. Baker “is with very few exceptions the oldest Colonist in the N. Island if not, the whole of New Zealand.” Not so: most of the early Missionaries who preceded Mr. Baker’s father had large families, many of them the seniors of Mr. E. Baker; of whom Archdn. S. Williams and his lady living here are examples.—</p>
         <p>2. “Mr. E. Baker’s father was the <hi rend="italic">third </hi>Missionary to land in N. Zealand, having come out in 1827.” Again, not so. Here I give the sequence of the earl;y Missionaries, from official sources—placing the Rev. S. Marsden, the founder of the Mission, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, though there were two others, Missionaries, in New Zealand <hi rend="italic">before </hi>him—Messrs Kendal, and Hall.</p>
         <p>1814. 	Marsden, Kendal, Hall, King.</p>
         <p>—		C. Davis (who returned to England, and was lost <lb/>with his ship at sea, on his voyage back to <lb/>N. Zealand).</p>
         <p>1819.	Kemp, Fairburn, Butler.</p>
         <p>1820.	Shepherd.</p>
         <p>1821.	Puckey.</p>
         <p>1823.	H. Williams, and (present) Archd. S. Williams.</p>
         <p>1824.	G. Clarke, R. Davis, S. Davis.</p>
         <p>1825.	J. Stack.</p>
         <p>1826.	W. Williams (late Bp. of Waiapu, J. Hamlin.</p>
         <p>1828.	W. Tate, C. Baker.</p>
         <p>(I do not here include Revs. S. Leigh, N. Turner, and others, Wesleyan Missionaries, who were also residing in N.Z. in 1823.)</p>
         <p>3. “Lieut. Hobson” (should have been “<hi rend="italic">Capt.</hi>”) “administered the then primitive Government from the Kerekere (?) mission house.” Not so, but from Okiato, 3 miles further up the harbour,—formerly Lieut. Clendon’s residence</p>
         <p>4. “When Lieut. Hobson came to New Zealand he stayed with Rev. Charles Baker, who ultimately gave up his house to him and resided at Paihia.” Not so: Mr. C. Baker had been stationed by the Committee meeting in January, at Waikare, nearly 20 miles further S. from Paihia, and in April 1840 (his house having been finished) he removed thither with his family.</p>
         <p>5. “The first printing press, an old missionary press, was used at his house at Paihia, where the first Maori Bible was printed by the Rev. W. Colenso, about 1839.” Incorrect:—the first printing press in N.Z. was set up in a commodious wing of that “mission house” in January, 1835, which room was built and used for a Boys School-room (sons of missionaries), and the complete Maori New Testament was printed there in 1837. I do not know what is meant, or intended, by the term here used— “<hi rend="italic">an old missionary</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">press</hi>”;—it was selected in London by the Church Missionary Society, and I had brought it out with me in 1834.</p>
         <p>6. “When Sir Benjamin Franklin visited the Bay of Islands, after his explorations in the Antarctic Ocean in the Erebus and Terror, he made his head quarters at the Mission house,”—No such person was ever there! Sir James Ross was Commander of that expedition. (Sir <hi rend="italic">John </hi>Franklin (not Benjamin) was at that time Governor of van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania). Sir James Ross did not make his head-quarters at that “Mission house”, he kept closely on board of his ship. [see below.] The said house (from Mr. C. Baker’s finally leaving it in April 1840, sixteen months before the arrival of the Antarctic Expedition in the Bay of Islands,) was let to a person named Tibby, who took in respectable boarders, among whom were several well-known to me, as Mr. Felton Matthew Surveyor-General, Dr. Sinclair, Dr. Dieffenbach, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>7. “Mr. Ebenezer Baker and an elder brother (now deceased), as boys piloted him [Sir Benjamin Franklin] about the bays and creeks in a canoe.” Astonishing! I dare disbelieve this. (1) Mr. E. Baker with his brother were then residing at Waikare—at the fresh-water head of that long arm—many miles (20) by sea distant from the anchorage, and those ships. (2) I never knew a single instance of any of the sons of the Missionaries there being allowed (or even being able!) to do such a thing. (3) It was the winter season. (4) Sir J. Ross, and all his officers, were very particular (for several weighty reasons), they had unremitting scientific duties to perform, and were well supplied with boats and with men. I will quote a few words from his published account:—</p>
         <p>“The unceasing round of hourly observations” (on shore at the observatory, as well as on board of the two ships,) “was soon brought into operation, and provided full occupation for all of the executive officers of both ships, except only the senior lieutenants, who remained in charge of the vessels. The medical officers, in their turn,” (Messrs. McCormick, and J.D. Hooker,) “made short excursions into the interior, for the purpose of increasing our collections of natural history; but the natives at the time of our visit were beginning to feel deeply, and express in terms of severe bitterness, their great disappointment at the effects of the Treaty of Waitangi, so that I did not consider it advisable to permit those officers to extend their researches to any considerable distance from the position we had taken up. And although it was necessary to despatch boats several miles up the river,” (on the Kawakawa arm, directly divergent from Waikare) “for the purpose of obtaining the spars we required, yet I thought it proper they should be well-armed and prepared to resist any attack which the natives seemed well disposed to make; indeed so strong was the impression on my mind of the readiness of the natives to sieze any favourable opportunity of regaining possession of their lands and driving the Europeans out of the country, that I always felt much anxiety during the absence of our people.”—“<hi rend="italic">Sir James Ross’ Voyage to the S. Seas,</hi>” vol.II, p.62. (5) I, myself, was the only one of the Mission who ever accompanied any of those officers, particularly the Botanist of the Expedition, my friend, the present Sir J.D. Hooker; who, on several occasions, went with me in my boat to Waikare forests, and to Waitangi, and to Kerikeri waterfalls: (<hi rend="italic">vide </hi>his published works).</p>
         <p>8. “When Sir Benjamin Franklyn” (<hi rend="italic">B.F. </hi>again!) was at the Bay of Islands Lady Franklyn was given one of the Mission House horse hair arm chairs, which the Maories attached poles to and carried her about the country.”—Lady Franklin, the wife of Sir John Franklin Governor of van Diemen’s Land, visited the Bay of Islands in the <hi rend="italic">early summer </hi>of 1841; but the Discovery ships in the <hi rend="italic">winter</hi> of that same year. At that time (as I have already stated) Mr. E. Baker was living with his father at Waikare. Lady Franklin, having sprained her ancle, was so carried about (when on land), but not by Maoris while in the Bay of Islands; the boat’s crew did all that, and was always kindly attended by the late Capt. Beckham. The term here again used— “the Mission house,” is, to say the least of it, misleading: (1) the house in which Mr. Charles Baker, Catechist, had resided at the N. end of Paihia was never known by such a name: (2) if any one of the three missionaries houses in that station was, or should have been, so called, it was the one at the S. end, occupied by the Rev. H. Williams, (but I never once heard it so called,—who, perhaps, also supplied the “horsehair arm chair,” if such an article of luxury was then to found in the Mission (?) More likely, however, it was loyally and kindly furnished by Mr. James Busby, late the British Resident, for the Lady of the Governor of V.D.L., as he did possess such furniture, and if so then the article itself is now in my possession, having been purchased by me at the auction of Mr. Busby’s goods.—</p>
         <p>9. “He” (Mr. E. Baker) “as a boy of 10, and was present at the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.” I doubt this very much; a similar mistake having been made by other Colonists who were also boys at that time. (1) I have no recollection of any of the sons of the Missionaries being present at Waitangi on that occasion; such, indeed, was wholly opposed to the regular dealings of the Missionaries with their children, who were always carefully kept away from all the great meetings of Maoris, fearing the ultimate results, even when such were held on, or near to, the Mission Station. (2) But I dare say he was present at the English township Kororareka (now Russell), two days after the signing of the Treaty,—when the great Demonstration and rejoicings took place, to which all Europeans were specially invited (I know his eldest brother, William, and their father, were there). (3) And, also, it was there, very likely, where he heard the first Proclamation read, on the 30<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. of January,—as is related in my pamphlet.</p>
         <p>10. “In his intercourse with the natives he was a witness of their cannibal customs at that time, having seen human flesh carried about and afterwards eaten.” This, also, astonishes me! If Mr. E. Baker really said this,—I should like to know where, and when; for I am obliged to greatly doubt it.—</p>
         <p>11. I note, the common Maori names of places are incorrectly given, and this, too, repeated.—</p>
         <p>12. And, lastly, as the well-known name of “Benjamin Franklin” has been twice given in your notice, I would observe that this present year, 1890, is the Centenary of the death of the celebrated Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the American <hi rend="italic">Printer</hi>, philosopher, and politician.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, I heartily join in your closing words:— “We offer Mr. Baker hearty congratulations on the celebration of his natal day, and join with his many friends in wishing him “many happy returns of the day”.</p>
         <p>I trust my letter may not prove too long for your columns. It has ever been, and is, my permanent wish, to do all in my power to correct the many errors respecting the early days and doings in this Colony that are still existing, which are frequently freshly brought forward by the Press in New Zealand,—notably that of the day in which Capt. Cook took possession of this N. Island on N. Zealand. Which important event is always wrongly given in all our Colonial Almanacs, &amp;c., &amp;c.,—although so long back as fourteen years ago, I gave its proper authentic history and true date;—published in the “<hi rend="italic">Transactions N.Z. Institute</hi>,” vol. X, p.99. Harding’s Almanac, printed here in Napier, being the only one that has adopted the correct date.</p>
         <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>
         <p>William Colenso.</p>
