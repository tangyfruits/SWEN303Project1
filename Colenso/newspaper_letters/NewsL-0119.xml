         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your issue of this morning you have a long letter from a certain being yclepd “Strongbow;” which is intended as a reply to, and (in his opinion) a crusher of, my letter to you of the 9th inst. You will please to permit me to make a few remarks on “Strongbow’s” letter although in my doing so I depart from my old-established rule of not noticing anonymous scribblers. It is true, that in this instance, you have courteously informed both me and the public, that I can have the real name of “Strongbow” from you on application; and this, you further tell us is from him; (but whether voluntarily on his part, or required by you, you do not say.) But why should I trouble myself about his Name? seeing he is ashamed, or not manly and honest enough, to give it? Was he afraid of openly owning his written thoughts? or, (seeing he had used gross “personalities” concerning me in his public letter, which you, sir, were obliged to cut out and lay aside,) was he afraid of what might possibly follow,—a prosecution for libel, a challenge, or a public horsewhipping? Perhaps, if I were only a few years younger, I might be induced to call on you for his Name, and then “Strongbow” would have to look out,—albeit a head and shoulders (it may be) taller than myself: I might be foolish enough to take the law (for once) into my own hands,—remitting the ultimate consequences to a jury of my countrymen. </p>
         <p>But, to me, there is no need to see his name in big Roman letters. I know it well enough. Certain portions of his letter bring to mind the old fable of the Ass in the Lion’s skin, and his awkward attempts at concealment. “Strongbow” has given me in his letter the two angles, and I can easily find the third. So, whether he chooses the name of “Strongbow” or “<hi rend="italic">Long</hi>bow,”— or, even the ancient kingly name of <hi rend="italic">Longshanks</hi>, or (if I am right in my geometrical calculation,) that by which he is said to be commonly known in the country,— “Big Sulky,” it is all one to me. The Riddle, or Enigma, is found out. </p>
         <p>And in order to enable others to find the required answers, I will just call their attention to the following three things (as I take it), that “Strongbow” has let out of himself:— </p>
         <p>1. He says, positively: “I am not a Good Templar, Blue Ribbonite, nor fanatical temperance man of any kind.” </p>
         <p>2. He says again positively:— “I have travelled over the Seventy-Mile Bush road hundreds of times.” </p>
         <p>3. He says, relatively:— “I would like to see Mr Colenso and his batch of badly-treated travellers going out mustering on one of the back country sheep runs, when they would have to carry lunch on their saddles or go without.” </p>
         <p>—And here mark, that while “Strongbow” speaks of their “lunch on their saddles” (after having had a good breakfast at the Station), he omits to mention the flask of whisky in the breast pocket from the home store! forgetting, that “what is sauce for the Goose is sauce for the Gander.”</p>
         <p>Now consider the above 3 marks, and you may easily find out “Strongbow.” </p>
         <p>Having done with the writer, I will now turn to his writing. And, first, he cannot fairly quote my letter, which he criticises! He says,— “Mr Colenso is very pathetic in recounting the hardships of the traveller who had to go without his lunch till 2 o’clock.” Where have I said this? I never wrote about “<hi rend="italic">lunch,</hi>” (with me, always, an unnecessary meal,) — nor “2 o’clock;” but about the probable long fast in wet and cold and wind, and confined to a sitting posture, it may be no breakfast, no dinner till 2.30, or 3.0, or even later, such I have myself seen, and then the probable and reasonable consequences. Again: our truly respectable large new clean well-furnished and orderly hotels, (of which we should be justly proud,) and also contumeliously styled by “Strongbow,”— “grog shops,”— “grog shanties,”— “grog mills,” &amp;c. Again: that such (hotels) are not required by the “few solitary travellers” on that main and only road between Napier and Wellington. </p>
         <p>“Strongbow” says,— “I have travelled over the 70-mile Bush-road hundreds of times, and my experience impels me to negative Mr Colenso’s conclusions.” Allowing that “Strongbow” has so “travelled,” (mind, always on horseback, or by coach) and so, passing those hotels,—or, say, the one at Matamau,—without stopping; what does that show again of my experience of repeated and long sojourning there,—in winter and in summer, in wet and dry,—and my frequent travelling on foot for many miles both N. and S. on the main road, and often meeting with many poor fellows toiling along with their swags on their backs, seeking employ, and anxiously enquiring the hour (in the Bush), and—if new hands—the distance to the hotel, that there they might rest awhile, have their glass of good Beer (or whisky) with their bread and mutton, or cheese, which tired Nature required, and then go on their way strengthened—and thankful. </p>
         <p>No doubt, “Strongbow” has (like myself) seen those poor sons of toil on the road;—but has he ever been known to give one of them a “saxpence,”—or a “bawbee,”— wherewith to pay for a glass of beer, or a pipe of tobacco? Methinks I hear (or have heard) “Strongbow” reply, with becoming hauteur,—in the language of George Canning to the needy knife-grinder,<note xml:id="ftn46" place="foot" n="46"> Colenso the knife-grinder: see satiric letters on the “Knife-grinders’ Society” (the HBPI) 1883–1884, and references to them in Colenso’s private letters—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
                  </note>— </p>
         <p>“I give thee 6d! I will see thee d—–d first!” </p>
         <p>But to shorten this part: there are many now who daily (I may say, continually) travel by that road, both going and coming, and their number will increase; and it is to the travelling public in general that I look to decide, who is right,— “Strongbow” or myself; as to the advantages and benefits, or the disadvantages and evils, arising to the whole community from those scattered Bush hotels. </p>
         <p>But I have not quite done yet with “Strongbow.” I must now gently note his knowledge of History; particularly as he has taken on himself to teach me (or you, Sir, or all of us) something of History both Ancient and Modern.— </p>
         <p>Of Ancient History, “Strongbow” says:— “Mr Colenso says, an ounce of fact is worth a pound of theory. So it may be occasionally, and here is another <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> for Mr Colenso.... Theory told Galileo that the world was round; facts afterwards proved him to be correct.”— </p>
         <p>Oh! dear! Shade of Galileo!! Stars and Stripes!!! Boys of the 4th Standard in our Common Schools!—listen to that!! “Theory told Galileo that the world was round; facts afterwards proved him to be correct.” Why the rotundity (or, roundness, “Strongbow,”) of the the world was known and proved 500 years before the Christian era! It was the revolution (or, turning “Strongbow,”) of the world (or earth) on its own axis that Galileo confirmed, (on his discovery of the telescope,) and for that he was persecuted; and this also was known long before, and was the foundation of the present received Copernican theory. </p>
         <p>Of Modern History,—Strongbow descants largely (in his way) on the dreadful evils arising to our children away in the Bush, from those few hotels; he says:— “Does Mr Colenso think, that the interests of the settlers shall be overridden for the sake of a few solitary travellers—that the growing youth of the 70-Mile Bush shall be contaminated by the continual sight of drunkenness, and debauchery, and the continued temptation to become tipplers, &amp;c.” Ahem! (nearly as bad, as to recklessness of speech, as that of the Blue-Ribbon <hi rend="italic">Sub</hi>. John Harding!) Now let us see; “Strongbow” has allowed, that my saying, “An ounce of fact is worth a pound of theory,” and so I will give him a bit of our own real and well-known Modern History, to repel the whole of his “high-flown statement.”— </p>
         <p>I will just take 4 of our oldest villages, or “townships” now; which have each had for more than 25 years a hotel in it; two of them being also still very isolated out-of-the-way places: Havelock, Waipukurau, Hampden, and Porangahau. Those places, I may also remark, have witnessed scenes of drunkenness &amp;c., in past and early times of disorder, that will never be seen again in Hawke’s Bay. In all those long-settled places, children were born, taught in the Schools, brought up, entered on active life, settled, and married; and I (as the old Inspector of Schools for many years,) have known them all. I challenge “Strongbow” to point out the “contamination” among them! the drunkard, the loafer, the dissolute, the idler! Our Country Youth, as a whole, are far more sober and hardworking, than those of similar townships at Home. Indeed, I have more than once thought, in past years, when engaged in visiting officially among them, that those sights were after all more beneficial than otherwise to the children;—according to the mode of the ancient Greeks, the dealings of the Spartans with their Helots (slaves, “Strongbow,”)—making them publicly drunk, &amp;c., that their Grecian Youth in beholding it might learn and love to keep sober. And, further, too: some of our early settlers’ children, were, alas! the children of those who, unfortunataly, drank too much; but I don’t find that in this respect they turn after their parents; neither is their general health, so depraved as “Strongbow” would make it appear to be; on the contrary, I think, (in not a few instances known to me,) they are healthier and more able than those of some weak teetotallers. Besides it must not be forgotten, that our British gentry generally, of whom we are rightly proud, are descendants of Heavy drinkers: Well do I remember the drinking days of the time of George IV.—In conclusion, I hope, “the grand and glorious physical and mental greatness of the coming New Zealanders,” will be a <hi rend="italic">leetel</hi> superior to that of “Strongbow,” or they will be nowhere in the race! So, Ta! ta! “Strongbow,” and Goodnight.—I am, &amp;c., </p>
