         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your paper of this morning you give us a copy of the petition for Bible reading in the public schools, to be brought forward for adoption and signature at the meeting convened for Monday next. You also have in the same paper, a letter signed by “A Lover of the Bible,” evidently written in support of the same scheme. I regret to see them both. Allow me to give a few reasons, out of many, for my so saying. Were the meeting an <hi rend="italic">open</hi> one, I would attend, and there “say my say.”</p>
         <p>I take up the text of the petition first. What Bible is it that is here called (in rather dark and stiltified language) “the authoritative Exponent of the National faith?” which Bible is sought to have read daily in schools “without note or comment?” It cannot be the old and larger Bible of the Roman Catholics, because they never have and would not allow of it; therefore it is the Protestant or smaller Bible. Here, then, at the outset, is the grand difference; this great division between the <hi rend="italic">two </hi>“authorised” Books, or Bibles, of the Christian Churches; which this petition (supposing it to become effectual!) would serve to keep up, and that too by the great injustice of excluding all the Roman Catholic youth from the public schools! still serving as fuel for the fire, the making of old religious (or Church) feuds the stronger, more bitter and lasting. Of course I shall be reminded by Bigots, Shallow-pate, &amp; Co.,—there is the “Conscience clause!” true; I know it, I will come to that by-and-by.</p>
         <p>Now this grand distinction between those two Bibles, both containing, alike “the elements of the nation’s faith” (whatever that may mean), is an obstacle that cannot be got over:—So much then for the book—the Bible.</p>
         <p>But supposing it could,—or (what is sought in the said petition,) that the Protestant Bible should be so daily read “without note or comment.” Anything more bald more wretched in the way of training the young I can scarcely conceive. (And, please, bear in mind, that I write from long pactice and experience in the matter;) For, there in the schools, on the one hand, the children would have the scientific elementary works of the day, written in clear modern language, teaching them, as far as is known, the truth about all natural things; which truths, be it ever remembered, are as surely from God as the best of the Bible is. Truths, whether in Astronomy, Geology, Natural History, or the sciences generally; on which subjects, of course, any amount of questions might be put, and encouraged too, and answered by the competent teacher,—to a willing pliant class, whose whole minds would be absorbed in their pleasing work, drinking in such daily instruction as the grass does the nightly dew, and growing too thereby. While, on the other hand, in reading the Bible; no questions must be asked! Lesson over; shut books! Why? (1.) Because many awkward questions might arise, which, if answered after the old one-groove and stereotype fashion, would disagree with the other and truthful teachings of the school; and therefore soon found out, even by children, not to be the truth! or, (2.) Because of the incompetency of the teacher to answer them completely? or (3.) Because of his sectarianism, which prevents him from answering them truly? or (4.) Because the Bible is the Word of God?—</p>
         <p>I leave it to the supporters of the said scheme to decide, which of those 4 reasons they prefer. </p>
         <p>Very likely they (or most of them) may prefer the last one; still saying (as of old but with far less reason,) that the Bible—all within its covers from Genesis to Revelation—is the Word of God. </p>
         <p>And, first, I will apply myself to this. If so, is it right and proper—on the part of the children—to have God’s word merely read in that hurried hireling kind of way? Is that the way to have proper reverence paid to God and to the holy Scriptures?</p>
         <p>Is that the way to inculcate the holy truths therein taught on the youthful mind? To be read merely as an additional reading exercise,—in many cases, too, a hard one, often an irksome one; especially when the noisy glee of their frolicsome and happy schoolmates comes rolling in through the open windows, calling away their attention and distracting their minds,—embittering them, I might have said, (guided, perhaps, by the Devil!) Here, if anywhere, would be seen the truth of the old saying,—Where the treasure is, there is the heart; and the heart would assuredly be with the players outside. And the sure consequences would follow; the bitter crop to be reaped from that seed,—that the Bible, its reading and its study, would get to so disliked by them as they grew up. </p>
         <p>If the Bible be the Word of God,—then, I say, it should be carefully and reverentially approached and read; not hurriedly or as a forced and distasteful task; with all the needful explanation possible, given in the most winning way, and that only by competent teachers.</p>
         <p>It has long, very long, seemed to me, that the proper Christian way to work the so-called “Conscience clause” (here, among us, and under present circumstances,) is for the several Ministers of Religion to work <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than they do, and work heartily too. If the Bible be the Word of God, let them, as His paid servants, teach it, open it, explain it, to the lambs of their respective flocks. There is the whole of the Saturday (to say nothing of the Sunday-schools,—when, however, they are generally otherwise employed); let them on the Saturday assemble their children belonging to their respective sects or denominations; all of them have time enough to do this; and if they enter on this duty with a good heart, willingly and zealously, I have no doubt of their being useful to the children; far more so than any, or all of our school teachers could possibly be in merely hearing the children read the Bible daily “without note or comment!” But then, again, that real usefulness will depend whether those Ministers are sticklers for dogmas and forms, and old-fashioned obsolete untruthful Catechisms!—more desirous of keeping the youth of both sexes in a kind of sectarian thrall or bondage, than in teaching them the pure enlightening unfettered Truth.</p>
         <p>“Holding back all noble feeling, 	<lb/>  Choking down each manly view;	<lb/>Caring more for forms and symbols 	<lb/>  Than to know the Good and True.”</p>
         <p>With your permission I will send you the remainder of my letter for your next issue; when I will notice the letter of “A Lover of the Bible.”	<lb/>		Yours, &amp;c.,	<lb/>
