      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—</p>
      <p>“Shut, shut the door, good John! fatigued, I said;     <lb/>Tie up the knocker; say, I’m sick, I’m dead.”—</p>
      <p>Thus (if I recollect aright) our great English poet, Pope, commences one of his epistles: the occasion—his being tired with so many folks asking him to correct their verses. And surely I, wretched mortal! (and the generality of your readers) must be equally tired at seeing my name so often thrust tost fetched and jerked before the public, on account of my political sins. I had hoped I had quite done with politics, (quite time, some may say,) but, “goodness me!” what can a poor fellow do—how upon earth can he be quiet, when he is so pitched into (that I say not <hi rend="italic">pitchforked</hi>) every week in your paper. And now, “Act IV., scene 4,” lo! Mr. Robert Pharazyn, suddenly resuscitated, comes pop upon the stage! But, “Oh dear” (as Mr. Pepys in his diary might have written,) oh dear! the overweening vanity of some young men—who fancy themselves to be something when they are nothing. However, I should not complain; seeing, that, in the House of Representatives, one of the members said, that he feared it would require military force to make the colonial youth of Canterbury know their proper places—a colonial failing, Mr. Editor, a colonial failing. It is now 25 years since I left my father’s house for this land, during which time I have in one sphere or another, been working hard for the good of my fellow-men (strange! if I should not have gathered a few fruits of experience in a quarter of a century!)—while here, in your, paper of the 21st inst., I have, unasked, an inexperienced colonial youth, who has scarcely numbered the same amount of years, thrusting himself publicly upon me as the corrector of my letter to you of the 19th ulto., and as my very sage monitor! Surely there must be a deficiency with that party to whom he professedly belongs (and who endeavoured to foist him upon us as their nominee at the late election!)—or, the young man’s “wish to see His name in print” (as Byron says,) must have been so strong that he could not be held in. Be it as it may, (astronomically speaking,) “a sad. error, in computation this”:—but, anon.— </p>
      <p>Of course I shall pass unnoticed all my young mentor’s grave charges of “bungling sophisms” and “sophistry” and “fallacy” and “false analogy” and of my being “less enlightened” and “less candid” than himself and party. I intend, however, in briefly noticing his own “<hi rend="italic">fallacies</hi>” and “<hi rend="italic">false analogies</hi>” to keep prominently before you, sir, his statement, that “<hi rend="italic">Mr. Colenso ought to know that a false analogy proves nothing, except dishonesty or incapacity in the person who uses it</hi>.” </p>
      <p>First, then, Mr. R. Pharazyn says,— “the sophistry I refer to consists in comparing the elected head of a government to an hereditary head, and concluding that what would be tyrannical conduct in the one would be the same in the other.” In reply, I say (remarking, by the way, that I made no such (foolish) comparison—the two tyrants of ancient Rome whom I had cited, Marius and Sylla, having been both <hi rend="italic">elected</hi> by the people;)—in reply, then, I say, that, as to tyrannical conduct there is no difference; or, if any, the tyrannical conduct of an <hi rend="italic">elected</hi> leader is every way worse than that of an <hi rend="italic">hereditary</hi> one. I need not, sir, cite ancient or mediæval history; nor go back a few years of my own time to bring as a witness unhappy Poland. (*) Glance at the continent of Europe; see those two elected Heads, Louis Napoleon and the Pope of Rome; do their chains forsooth lie more lightly on their people because they were elected? rather, is not that very consideration the bitterest drop in the goblet which the patriots of France and Italy have to drink? Did not the young eagle the more keenly feel the arrow which brought him to the ground, when in rolling he saw that it was a feather from his own wing which had feathered the shaft?—Mr. R. Pharazyn, you, “<hi rend="italic">ought to know that a false analogy proves nothing, except dishonesty or incapacity in the person who uses it.</hi>” </p>
      <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Secondly</hi>: Mr. R. Pharazyn says— “There is just sufficient likeness between the Emperor of Austria and a Superintendent to make the analogy apparent; both are heads of governments; the assent of both is required to Acts before they become law.” Here is another “<hi rend="italic">false</hi> analogy”; being an echo of Mr. Woodward’s king-making sentence—that a “superintendent has sovereign powers.” But the truth is (or ought to be), that there is no likeness whatever between the Emperor of Austria and a Superintendent. Both are not heads of governments, in the same, or like, sense; for the Emperor of Austria has no man over him; but over a Superintendent there is, first, the Governor of New Zealand, and, secondly, there is the Queen (that I say not, also, a third, viz. the Provincial Council): neither is the assent of both in the same, or like sense, required to Acts before they become law; the Emperor of Austria says, “I will,” and who shall say nay; the New Zealand Superintendent says, “I will,” and lo! Governor Browne says “nay”; or the Governor assents to laws which the Superintendent wishes far enough off yet must obey; or a Judge of the Supreme Court with, a “<hi rend="italic">presto</hi>!” brings him to order, makes him recant and eat humble pie. Let it never be forgotten, that a New Zealand Superintendent in assenting to laws does so as the <hi rend="italic">locum tenens</hi> of a deputy. And while the Emperor of Austria possesses all the mighty <hi rend="italic">influence</hi> of appointing to places, a New Zealand Superintendent (speaking comparatively) has none,—he cannot appoint a common magistrate, or even a magistrate’s clerk! Oh! oh! Mr. Robert Pharazyn you “<hi rend="italic">ought to know that a false analogy proves nothing except dishonesty or incapacity in the person who uses it</hi>.” </p>
      <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Thirdly</hi>: Mr. R. Pharazyn says,— “Twenty two members of the Council have passed certain Bills, and the Superintendent has vetoed all those that he considered to be injurious to the best interests of the province.... So that, Dr. Featherston having been elected by a large majority of the provincial electors, is clearly right in opposing the representatives of a section of the province.” Here is another “fallacy” or “false analogy” of Mr. R. Pharazyn. For, the members and Superintendent are all alike men and freemen and elected servants of the public, and chosen for <hi rend="italic">one work</hi>; (had the members been merely animals, or slaves,—or had the Superintendent appointed them as <hi rend="italic">his</hi> servants, or had he been a god,—there would indeed have been a difference;) being then alike, as public men elected by the same body to <hi rend="italic">one work</hi>, there is no difference; why then should the voice of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> prevail against those of the twenty-two? only fancy the President of America vetoing <hi rend="italic">repeatedly</hi> all Bills passed by ¾ths of the Senate! why the very sea would be “flaring” from Cape Cod to Tampico!! Suppose last year <hi rend="italic">Dr. Welch</hi> had been elected Superintentendent, and, wishing to carry a point against the run-holders, had vetoed the Bills of the Provincial Council—if not exactly in their favour yet dealing fairly with them— “lauks!” what an uproar there would have been! an earthquake would have been as nothing to it. But we are further told, that “Dr. Featherston has been elected by a <hi rend="italic">large majority</hi> of the provincial electors:”—wait a bit; we shall see. Dr. Featherston was, last year, elected by 834 electors; the 22 Representatives, about the same time last year, polled 4980 votes; (†) Where now is Dr. Featherston’s “large majority?” But, further, still, Mr. R. Pharazyn states (meaning, I suppose, the election just concluded,) the number to be ‘890 electors’; (‡) but he knows very well that those Bills which were vetoed, were vetoed by the Superintendent who was elected by the 834 electors; or if he insists on the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> election, he must also know that Dr. Featherston had a less <hi rend="italic">majority</hi> by 120 over Mr. St. Hill than he had last year over Dr. Welch; and that he had been elected <hi rend="italic">not</hi> by a “<hi rend="italic">majority</hi>,” but actually by a MINORITY of the electors; the whole number on the Electoral Roll being 2400! Surely Mr. Robert Pharazyn “<hi rend="italic">ought to know, that a false analogy proves nothing, except dishonesty or incapacity in the person who uses it</hi>.” </p>
      <p>Now all these “fallacies” or “false analogies,” on Mr. R. Pharazyn’s part, arise (as I would charitably believe,) from his merely taking up at secondhand the opinions, and statements of other interested persons longer-headed than himself. Notwithstanding, since he has himself laid down the rule, that any such being used “<hi rend="italic">proves nothing, except dishonesty or incapacity in the person who uses it</hi>”;— I shall leave it to him to choose which of the two he will please to accept. </p>
      <p>Further: I am forced, sir, to believe, that Mr. R. Pharazyn does not know the difference between political power rightly <hi rend="italic">possessed</hi>, and political power rightly <hi rend="italic">exercised</hi>. Now such power is <hi rend="italic">rightly exercised</hi> only when it subserves the welfare of the whole community. For the avoidance of argument, it may be for the time conceded, that Dr. Featherston rightly <hi rend="italic">possesses</hi> the power of Superintendent; but that he has rightly <hi rend="italic">exercised</hi> it, is, I am very sure, lamentably far from truth, and plain enough to most, save to self-interested folks. Mr. Pharazyn, it is evident, thinks very highly of his own intellectual powers, (§)— which is by no means an uncommon qualification of young men; but, unfortunately for him, others do not think so; at any rate, there seems to be a sad confusion of mind in what little we have ever seen or heard. As a matter of course (such being generally the concomitant of vanity), he speaks very slightingly of what I have written and of my poor abilities—not even caring to consider, that, in all likelihood, I had passed through higher courses of studies than be had ever known; and that I had been engaged in public work from before he could have learned his <hi rend="smallcaps">a b c</hi>! Still, as I heartily wish him well, I would just remind him, that counter-assertion is not argument, and I would recommend him, to practice a little (if he can) the power of abstraction and detach accidental associations from truth itself. He speaks of my letter of the 19th ulto. as containing much “balderdash”: that, however, is a question for the public. I have very lately gone again through that letter; and I feel thankful, sir, that I have been permitted and enabled to pen (and through you to publish) such sterling truths:— </p>
      <p>“And joy a coming age will think with me.”— </p>
      <p>Very sure I am that the truths therein enunciated are wholly in accordance with the “<hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>”; and I would just hint to Mr. R. Pharazyn, that it would, perhaps be not altogether unadvisable for him (seeing that he is an aspirant after political honours,) to lay up that letter in some safe place for a future reference, (it may be after the writer is no more,) when, I venture to predict, he will find the principles I have therein written to be among the received and prized truths of the day.— </p>
      <p>Mr. Pharazyn also calls on me to “repent of having joined a party, not from a conviction that it was in the right, but because it was momentarily victorious.” How wonderfully the former part of this sentence agrees with his address, 9 months ago, to the Electors of Ahuriri! Then he said,— “in one word, our opponents feel themselves great in opposition. Their genius lies in destruction. ... ... ... <hi rend="italic">To join a party, for whatever object, is to them the greatest of political crimes</hi>.” (**) This needs no comment. As to the latter part of his sentence, my having joined a party because it was “momentarily victorious”: all I can say is, I do not understand him. </p>
      <p>Before I conclude I would remind Mr. Pharazyn (and others who speak like him), that, situated as we are, political matters are looked at by us from widely different fields of view. It is my belief, Sir, that it is morally impossible for Mr. R. Pharazyn to consider our present political state impartially; if he can, he is more than a common man. For (setting aside his great inexperience,) he is not only deeply interested personally in carrying out his own ultra views, (which, fully followed up, must end in keeping away a numerous free and thriving population from the District), but his father (who is also Dr. Featherston’s auditor), and relations are also alike interested in holding (as is well-known) the same principles; and I scarcely need add, that Mr. Robert Pharazyn has strenuously sought to be returned as our Member to the Provincial Council with the avowed determination of “going the whole hog” with Dr. Featherston’s party. So that, in Mr. R. Pharazyn’s case, there is not only self-interest (of first quality, and of colonial gage), but there is the equally strong bond of family ties; and the scarcely less one of vaulting yet disappointed ambition continually goading. </p>
      <p>On the contrary I—the writer of “balderdash”—I have no peculiar self-interest to serve (I defy my opponents to point such out); I have no relations, nor even powerful or dear friends, egging me on by example and precept; and I have no political ambition whatever. Nothing indeed is farther from my wishes (if I know myself); very much rather would I be far away among the sequestered glens of the Ruahine range “culling of simples” (and enjoying myself among the grand and truthful solitudes of Nature), than here writing on political subjects. </p>
      <p>And now, in conclusion, I would merely add, that I trust Mr. Robert Pharazyn will be benefitted by this letter, that he will have no just reason to complain of any discourtesy on my part, for if I have been more severe than usual, he should consider that he himself has evoked it. <hi rend="italic">Quis custodiet custodes</hi>.<note xml:id="ftn6" place="foot" n="6"> Who will guard the guards? —<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>

      <p>* An <hi rend="italic">hereditary</hi> monarchy is universally to be preferred to an <hi rend="italic">elective</hi> monarchy. The confession of every writer on the subject of civil government, the experience of ages, the example of Poland, and of the Papal dominions, seem to place this among the few indisputable maxims which the science of politics admit of”.— <hi rend="italic">Paley’s Moral and Politicat Phil., b.6, c.6</hi>.</p>
      <p>† See “Hawkes Bay Herald,” Nov. 21, 1857. </p>
      <p>‡ According to the Wellington papers, 886 is the real number for Dr. Featherston, and 576 for Mr. St. Hill; so that while Mr. R. Pharazyn runs Dr. F.’s number <hi rend="italic">on</hi> to the next 10, he brings Mr. St. Hill’s <hi rend="italic">back</hi>, to the last; a little matter truly, but a straw thrown up tells which way the wind blows.</p>
      <p>§ An article in the <hi rend="italic">Nelson Examiner </hi>of July 31, speaking on this very subject, says:— “If we are to believe the <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi> all the honest men opposed to them are fools, and all who have a grain of sense are unmitigated rogues; the electors who returned an adverse majority in the Provincial Council are a set of ignoramuses; and the members themselves a fair sample of those who sent them. They prove too much.... Then we have pleasant remarks on the “incoherent jargon” of one, the “virtuous indignation” of a second, “egotistical flourishes” of a third!” It is well, that what has been painfully noticed here, should have also been noticed in other provinces.</p>
