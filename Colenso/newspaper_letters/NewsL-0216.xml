        <hi rend="bold">THE CLOSE OF AN EVENTFUL LIFE.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>DEATH OF THE REV. W. COLENSO.</p>
      <p rend="justify">The Rev. W. Colenso, F.R.S., F.L.S., died early yesterday morning at his residence, Milton-road, his end coming peacefully. At 4 a.m. he called his housekeeper to procure him some refreshment, and when Mrs Anderson returned he seemed to be sleeping. Not wishing to disturb the sleeper, she did not wake him, but subsequently finding that he did not move, she went to his bedside and found him dead. The deceased, who came from an old Cornish family, was born in 1811, and was a first cousin to the late Bishop of Natal. </p>
      <p rend="justify">In October, 1887, Mr Colenso read a “Jubilee Paper” before the Hawke’s Bay Philosophical Society. This was intended “to commemorate more particularly the completion of the printing of the New Testament in the Maori tongue at Paihia, in the Bay of Islands, in the year 1837—60 years ago—an event that caused a great sensation at the time, both in New Zealand and at Home (although now in part forgotten), and one that was productive of incalculable good to the Maori race; together with the introduction of the printing press into this country; and also the gradual formation of the present written Maori language, with many peculiar and little-known circumstances pertaining to these pre-historic times, and incidental thereto.”         <lb/>In the year 1833, the Church Missionary Society having determined to send out a printing press and type, and all necessary material to the mission in New Zealand, were seeking a missionary printer to be in charge. In the end of that year Mr Colenso, then residing in London, was introduced to the secretaries of that society at their mission house, and engaged to come out to New Zealand with the press as a missionary. In 1834 he left London for Sydney en route to New Zealand, and after a long passage of 17 weeks the vessel arrived at Sydney. At that time there were only three clergymen of the Church of England residing in all Australia—two of them (the Revs. Messrs Cowper and Hill) in Sydney, and the Rev. S. Marsden at Parramatta. As no vessel could be found willing to leave for New Zealand, owing to fear of the Maoris, Mr Colenso was obliged to remain eight or nine weeks at Sydney. At last, after much entreaty, a small schooner of 67 tons was got ready, and he sailed on the 10th December for the Bay of Islands. After a long and eventful voyage of 20 days (suffering much from want of water, as well as from a complication of peculiar miseries), he landed at Paihia mission station in the Bay of Islands on December 30th, and in the following few days got the press, type, &amp;c., safely on shore.</p>
      <p rend="justify">At this time there were three missionaries with their wives and families living at Paihia—the Rev. H. Williams, the Rev. W. Williams, and Mr C. Baker. On the 17th February, 1835, Mr Colenso pulled proofs of the first book printed in New Zealand, the printing office being filled with spectators to witness the performance. The printing of the New Testament, consisting of 356 pages, was accomplished by the middle of December, 1837—naturally a cause of great rejoicing with Mr Colenso, who relates that many remarkable incidents happened at this time, showing the extreme value placed by the Christian and well-disposed Maori chiefs on the sacred volume. The powerful chiefs of Kaitaia (near Ahipara and the North Cape), Panakareao, wrote to Mr Colenso for a single copy; and in order that it should arrive the more dignified, he sent it all the way by a special messenger (a long journey of several days through a wild and little known dense untravelled forest), and with it he sent Mr Colenso one pound in gold for payment, strictly limiting his request to one copy only. It was the first sovereign Mr Colenso ever saw with a Maori or in this country, and the letter and the gold were well secured, being wrapped up in folds of cloth, and bound and worn turban fashion night and day on his head. As not many of the principal Maori chiefs or their sons could then write, many of them travelled on foot and barefooted to Paihia, from very great distances, to obtain a copy, at the same time running no small risks in their doing so, owing to the unsettled unavenged old feuds which still existed. Several distinguished early foreign visitors also got single copies by asking—as the Bishop of Australia, Admiral du Petit Thouars, of the French navy, Captains P.P. King and Harding, of the British navy, Commodore Wilkes, of the American exploring expedition, and others. </p>
      <p rend="justify">In 1842 the Bishop of New Zealand, Dr. Selwyn, arrived, accompanied by his chaplain, Rev. W.C. Cotton and others, and in the following year a printer having arrived at Paihia from the Society in England to take charge of the mission press, Mr Colenso went to reside with them at St. John’s College, Te Waimate. On Mr Colenso’s coming to reside in Hawke’s Bay in 1844 he brought with him a small Albion press and types which he again found to be of great service, though having a people scattered over a very large district to attend to, with its consequent heavy travelling on foot, there being then no roads, he could not use his little press so much as he wished. The deceased was at one time Inspector of Schools in Napier; and was also Treasurer for Hawke’s Bay in the Provincial Government days. He was the first member for Napier in the General Assembly, which sat in Auckland in 1861. </p>
      <p rend="justify">Mr Colenso was on several occasions president of the Hawke’s Bay Philosophical Society, before which institute he read many valuable papers on scientific matters. His portrait graces the museum of that institute, to remind the visitor of a life which bound together the past and the present generations. In Mr Colenso’s death a lone and solitary figure has passed away. He had dipped deep into the volume of Nature, had plucked secrets from her bosom which the future inhabitant of this country will value far above the passing profit of the moment, and which but for his keen perception, his acumen, would have been buried. The future historian, when examining into the earlier records of this country, will find in the traces left by this veteran, the most ample information as to all that was remarkable and characteristic in the peculiar period when Europeans first set their feet on Maori soil. On the verge of a new century he has gone, the labors of nearly a century to mark his passage. To the last moment he was busily engaged in preserving that which would keep the period in which he lived and moved in prominence in future years.</p>
      <p>To quote his farewell words to the Hawke’s Bay Philosophical Institute:— “I, as an aged minister of religion, and a fervent disciple of Nature, and with increasing convictions of the truth (soon by me to be realised), would say one word more to my audience re our talents and our time here; that as you sow now, you will reap hereafter. Young friends, don’t waste time; don’t abuse talents; seek to make the best use of both. Our bodies will remain, but our minds will go with us. And in a few beautiful and expressive lines of our classical English poet, Thomson—already quoted from by me—I close—</p>
      <lg>
        <l>Father of light and life! thou good supreme</l>
        <l>O, teach me what is good! teach me Thyself!</l>
        <l>Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,</l>
        <l>From every low pursuit! and feed my soul</l>
        <l>With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure.</l>
        <l>Sacred, substantial, never fading bliss.</l>
