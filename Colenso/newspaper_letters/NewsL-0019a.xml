      <p> No. 9.—<hi rend="smallcaps">A Mess of Pottage.</hi></p>
      <p>Christmas has come and gone! and so has my ugly and unwelcome visitor, rheumatism. The new year also has begun—the year of the spanking young heir attaining his majority—the year of liberty, of jubilee, to Napier and Hawke—the year to be hereafter gratefully remembered by generations yet unborn—the year in which the settlers of the province and the members of their choice will have great duties to perform. May all have that clearsightedness and disinterestedness which will enable them to perform those duties rightly! </p>
      <p>I have called this tract ‘a mess of pottage’ (without however intending to intrude on the good old English fare of the season);—and we know well, that ‘too many cooks spoil the broth.’ Now in all good messes—whether English soup or Irish stew, Scotch haggis or Spanish olla podrida—the grand secret is, to have just such a blending of viands and condiments as that no one shall predominate. For all made dishes the French have ever borne the bell; and yet they use garlic commonly in their pottages, but just in that nice way that the nauseous bulb is not detected. Only fancy a French cook at a club putting into his soup two or three thumping heads of garlic instead of one! Goodness!! what a row!!! enough to disturb poor Soyer’s repose. Fellow settlers! you will all acknowledge the truth of this—see then that you do not act the like part. ‘Be wide-awake’ (once more I say,) as to whom you vote for—as to who shall be your Council members. Let no one peculiar kind of viand or condiment predominate, or you will soon find that you have indeed cooked a very pretty mess of pottage—a fine kettle of fish for yourselves! It is well known that among us are several class interests (I would there were none.) To the electors of Napier in particular I would say—Choose from among yourselves fit men to represent you and your town interests. If you should have any runholders among you (or any from the country districts) seeking your votes, be timely warned—or your mess will be odorous with mutton fat, and prove rather indigestible for your delicate town stomachs. Do not however misunderstand me: I neither wish to see a <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> runholder excluded from our Provincial Council, nor the runholding interests depreciated. No doubt runholders will be returned from the country districts; but we shall find that it is infinitely more to us to have a good fair mess—or, in other words, to have the different great interests among us properly balanced,—than to hear by every mail the progress towards settling the eternal din and bother of the so-called ‘balance of power’ in Europe—which, by the way, never can be balanced. </p>
      <p>‘A mess of pottage!’ Yes: the oldest book among us tells us what a pretty kind of thing a certain freeholder once made of it in the infancy of our race—how that he <hi rend="italic">sold his birthright </hi>for a mess of pottage. And he repented of it afterwards but it was too late. Now, fellow-settlers, see that none of you do this. You may do it; but the poorest among you cannot do it as Esau did—through hunger.<hi rend="italic"> No man can possibly want in New Zealand</hi>. There may be some excuse for an elector at home (in the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> country, with its over population hard times hard taxes and harder unfeeling tory landlords,) for such an one voting against his conscience, against the public good:—such cannot exist here. Utterly impossible it is that you can ever find any excuse for remaining in flunkeydom. Notwithstanding I have heard strange tales. I have heard rumours of certain ‘pains and penalties’ to be visited on the refractory, on the disobedient, on the labouring man who shall dare to assert his own inalienable British birthright:— ‘If you do not vote for so-and-so, no more carting for you;—no more boating for you;—no more employ for you.’ ‘If you do not vote for so-and-so, money lent shall be called in;—certain favours shall no longer be granted’;—and so on. But, gracious God! are we indeed Englishmen—sticklers for British rights and liberty and rule—and for (what’s more) the common rights of man <hi rend="italic">as man</hi>—and yet dare we perpetrate such things? Shall our honored fatherland expend millions in redeeming the West India slaves—and much yearly ‘blood and treasure’ in putting down the accursed slave traffic—and the very New Zealand chiefs throughout the three islands have abolished slavery, and yet we hold our fellow-men in thrall? Can ‘Rule Britannia’ ever again be sung here amongst us (at the expected visit of Governor Browne, or at the separation fete, or at a dinner to be given to the members,) without a certain constriction of throat—alias, conscientious choking—when we glance round the room at the singing of the chorus—</p>
      <p>‘Britons never never never shall be slaves!’ </p>
      <p>Fellow settlers! fellow-countrymen! you especially who are in the situation of masters, or possessed of influence,—do away at once and for ever with all such abomination. I was informed, by a person who took round our petition for separation to obtain signatures, that at three runholders’ stations the men in their employ refused to sign, at the same time saying, that they wished to sign it, but that ‘they had been bound down (or made to promise) by their employer not to sign, and that while they agreed with the petition and regretted their promise, they would stick to their word.’ Here was honor on the part of the working-man! here was dishonor—grievous thick heavy leaden stygian mean unprincipled conduct—on the part of the employers! and yet these persons call themselves gentlemen! and Englishmen!! and ‘sympathisers with the labouring classes’!!! </p>
      <p>It is to be hoped that all such attempts have <hi rend="italic">passed</hi>. Otherwise such ‘gentlemen’ will certainly hook it under the ‘Corrupt Practices Prevention Act’—and there is ‘a chief among us’ who is on the look out, and who will glory in hooking some of those ‘respectable’ first class pikes. Listen:— ‘Every person who shall directly or indirectly, by himself or by any other person on his behalf.... impede prevent or otherwise interfere with the free exercise of the franchise of any elector, or shall thereby compel induce or prevail upon any elector either to give or to refrain from giving his vote at any election.... shall be guilty of a misdemeanour punishable by fine and imprisonment, and shall also be liable to forfeit the sum of £50 <hi rend="italic">to any person</hi> who shall sue for the same, together with costs of suit.’* Further: those who shall be convicted of any of these offences lose their electoral rights for 3 years, and will have their names published in a kind of <hi rend="italic">Black</hi> List. And both the person bribing and he who is bribed are alike liable to the common penalties of fine and imprisonment, with this difference that a further penalty of £100 may be inflicted by the Supreme Court on the person offering a bribe, and a penalty of £10 on the person accepting it. These stringent remedies have been provided against those sad interferences which have too often prevailed over freedom of election among us. So that now no Road Surveyor nor Contractor nor Paymaster nor Gauger nor influential Electioneering Agent, can turn the scale through the influence of his office or situation, and so swamp the independent electors who are above his schemes. But it will be of little service for the cook to have pepper and salt, or the doctor remedies, unless such are <hi rend="italic">used</hi>. </p>
      <p>Fellow Countrymen! especially you of the laboring class, be above being bought. See to it, that your British stomachs rise with honest pride against it. Why should you be made niggers?</p>

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H.R. Russell. Napier, Feb. 10, 1859.” —<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
