        <hi rend="italic">“Dare lucem et dare servem.”</hi>
      </p>
      <p>No. 6.—<hi rend="smallcaps">Honey-dew Tobacco</hi>. </p>
      <p>——– “He hath been a courtier, he swears.—–If any man doubts that let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone three taylors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.” ———Just so, O thou inimitable Shakespeare! We live in an age of adulteration and paint, when impudent quacks and charlatans strive to carry their own private ends under the guise of serving the public. Strongly reminding one of the ugly vampire bat of S. America, which, by the aid of its wings flapping and fanning, gently sucks a man’s blood until its huge belly is full. That “truth is stranger than fiction” is a truism; yet it is astonishing, that men who are sensitively alive to their own interests, and who even seek to follow the deductions of science, should in general consent to be hoodwinked in matters of Religion and Politics. Why should black be called white, or bitter sweet? Why, (for instance,) should spirituous liquors strongly adulterated which have killed and are yearly killing their thousands, be called “Cream of the Valley,” and the “Water of Life”? or, why should a most horrible nauseous and highly poisonous vegetable substance be launched into the world under the <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> name of “Honey-dew”? For no other reason than this, that men, rational knowing ’cute white men, are content to be gulled by the knavish and designing, equally with the Fuegian and Australian savage, who is the dupe of mariners and chapmen through their gewgaws and trinketry. Even intelligent men too often forget, that there are men to be found now-a-days whose vocation seems to be how best to club their wits to deceive the unwary and confiding. “Men, who,” as Sir W. Temple says, “under the disguise of public good, pursue their own designs of power, and such bastard honours as attend them.”—Especially in matters of state (large or small,) and the getting-hold-of and retaining power in their own hands;—for this they will roar as gently as a sucking-dove;—use perfumed words dropping honey,—and hesitate not to speak all manner of ill (privately and anonymously, if they dare not openly,) concerning the man who sees through their stratagems—the honest man who is better than themselves. </p>
      <p>May not a dog be choked with pudding? or a man with honey-comb? Can we conceive the Duke of Clarence to have had a sweeter death in his choosing to be drowned in a butt of malmsey in the Tower, than if he had been drowned in the Thames? or, would a silken halter effectually disguise the rough and unwelcome hands of Jack Ketch? These thoughts, and many similar, have passed rapidly through my mind during the past week; mainly owing to what I heard at Napier.</p>
      <p>“Here comes an old trout; tickle him well and take him.” At Napier an elector informed me that he had been called on by a certain person (A,) who endeavoured to induce him (B,) to pledge his vote at the coming election for a third (C,) and by no means to vote for another (D,) who had bean spoken of as a Candidate. And thus A began:— “You know, B, what is good and proper, for you are an old settler; now you must vote for C, because he is a <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> man; as to D, you must not think of him, for he you know is an <hi rend="italic">atheist</hi> &amp;c., &amp;c.” </p>
      <p>[For the time I omit the names, as well as the blarney and soft sawder.] </p>
      <p>Now I should like to know even believing (which <hi rend="italic">I do not</hi>) the statement of A, that C is a “religious” man, and that D is an “atheist,”—I should like to know, I say, what such has to do with the matter of a <hi rend="smallcaps">fit</hi> man as member-of-Council or Superintendent? Am I again to hear of such vagaries in the present year of grace, 1859, as that an ascetic or an imbecile or “a friend” or any man or what you please is fit to govern a free and rising people <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he is “religious”? This would be to go back to the thirteenth century, to the times of Peter de Murrho (or Celestine V.); who was chosen Pope and Head of Christendom <hi rend="italic">because</hi> of his being such a “religious” man; and who, after a short 3 months reign, abdicated, as unfit for the office of governing! Am I indeed to hear of a gifted man of comprehensive mind—a man to whom N. Zealand as a whole Colony is indebted—a man who, when even residing at a distance and using his talents in the service of a rival Province, was by <hi rend="italic">that</hi> town and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> province where he had <hi rend="italic">formerly</hi> dwelt chosen solely on account of known merit as their representative in the great assembly of the Colony—a man to whom Napier and the Province of Hawke owes much, and to nothing more than to his conscientious uprightness and integrity:—am I to hear, I ask, and to be pained in hearing, such a man spoken of as being unfit to steer our craft because he is an “atheist”? At present I purposely abstain from asking, whether A is able to judge in such matters; or, whether A is not a little indebted to D for certain kind offices; or, whether A has not somewhat deviated from the golden rule of charity or apostolic religion in thus speaking ill, and that too of an absent one; or whether A really knows what constitutes an “atheist,” or what a “religious” man. </p>
      <p>The <hi rend="italic">time</hi>, too, to the thinking mind, in which such an attempt was made, was singularly and strikingly unfelicitous. The day on which we received our long-looked for July and August mails—which, informed us of the breaking-down of more of the barriers of superstition and bigotry at home, in the admission of a Jew into parliament—and of the sweeping away of those blots from the Prayer Book of the Church of England, as the religious services for Gunpowder plot, and Charles <hi rend="italic">the Martyr</hi> (!) and the restoration of his precious son Charles II. Yes: this very time was that in which A made his nefarious attempt in the town of Napier! </p>
      <p>Brother electors!—especially you of the town of Napier and neighbourhood—once more I say, <hi rend="italic">be on your guard.</hi> Beware of honied words and fine promises and sanctified appearances. You have those among you who know how to play fast and loose, who know well how to run with the hare and walk with the hound. You have those among you actively <hi rend="italic">working</hi>, who have openly avowed their holding to “all fair in love war and politics.” Those men have hitherto opposed, and those men will ever oppose the true advancement of our province in its entirety. Believe not their honied words; believe not their planned their studied phrases; believe not their “sympathy with the working-man”; ’tis all syllabled moonshine used only to befog your brains. Take a hint from L’Estrange’s thrush:— “Mother, says the thrush, never had any such a friend as I have of this swallow. No, says she, nor ever mother such a fool as I have of this same thrush.” </p>
      <p>Honest settlers of the province, you know me well. “I cannot cog, and say that thou art this or that, like many of those lisping hawthorn buds, that come like women in men’s apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in simpling time.” As I said in <hi rend="italic">tract</hi> No. 4, vote for no man merely because of this or that quality or qualification, if he is deficient in <hi rend="smallcaps">fitness for office and honesty of purpose</hi>. A <hi rend="italic">truly “religious” man</hi>, is indeed a great blessing, a treasure, an example, but such are very very rare; of such I need not speak. Jesus Christ was such; and all His <hi rend="italic">real</hi> followers will ever be known by His one unerring badge of <hi rend="smallcaps">love</hi>. But this one thing I will say, and I say it after long studying the subject and as a Christian man,—that I would rather be under an Atheist, or Jew, or Turkish Superintendent, <hi rend="italic">if he possessed the proper fitness for his office</hi>, than under the greatest saint that ever wore a gown or cowl, without it. </p>
