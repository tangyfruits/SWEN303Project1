         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Your paper of this morning—and of a few late days, in which so much has been said <hi rend="italic">ad captandum </hi>on the subject of Prohibition—brought strongly to my mind two old lessons: one, a subject, and one, an object, lesson. The former being the short, neat saying of the German philosopher Göethe,— “In this world there are so few voices and so many echoes.” And, the latter being a copperplate engraving I have in an old folio volume of Voyages and Travels, showing, “The manner in which the Apes fight the Lyons in Barbary”;—in this plate the apes are depicted drawn up together behind a sand-heap, flinging sand into the advancing lions’ eyes! Many of those and similar thoughts have arisen in my mind from perusing the letter in your paper of this morning, signed “John Hosking.”</p>
         <p>If time with me permitted, and your columns were also open, I should like to take up “John Hosking’s” letter line by line, to show the gross erroneousness of it, the wine question (as set forth in the Bible) having been closely and fully studied by me (and that aided from first class and original sources), 40–50 years ago, when I had both time and opportunity for the work,—and <hi rend="italic">no bias. </hi>Moreover, I may be permitted to briefly mention that I am the only one of us remaining, who 60 years ago (1836) formed the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>public <hi rend="italic">Temperance </hi>Society in New Zealand, and wrote and printed with my own hands the report of that meeting—(the same being the first book in English printed in New Zealand). That meeting was a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> temperance one—not a Teetotaller nor a Prohibition meeting—so often, now-a-days, impudently vamped up and obtruded on our notice under the Temperance flag!</p>
         <p>John Hosking has (strongly and designedly) brought forward a huge display of learning; all which, however (as mentioned by him), has been repeatedly published by teetotallers, and particularly by one of their leaders, Dr. Lees, some 25 years ago in an early edition of “<hi rend="italic">Kitto’s Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature,</hi>” under the heads of “The Lord’s Supper,” “The Passover,” “Fruits,” and “Wine”; but in the newer edition of that work Dr. Lees’ erroneous articles were excluded, those subjects being furnished by more truthful and competent hands.</p>
         <p>John Hosking says (of wine):— “The Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">Yayin </hi>denotes intoxicating wine. This class of drink is invariably condemned; it is <hi rend="italic">prohibited.” </hi>(The italics are J.H.’s) “I find (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) the word <hi rend="italic">Yayin </hi>so used 120 times in the Old Testament.”</p>
         <p>I agree with John Hosking, in <hi rend="italic">Yayin </hi>“denoting intoxicating (or fermented) wine;” but my position will be to show that the use of <hi rend="italic">Yayin </hi>is neither condemned or prohibited.</p>
         <p>Now for a few facts from Holy writ. I have lately had to read publicly in our Church on Sundays, lessons from the first book of Samuel. In the first chapter we find the high priest Eli charging Hannah with drunkenness; he told her to put away her <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi> from her; in denial she replied she had drunk neither <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">shechar</hi> (strong drink). Again, in the very same chapter we are told, that Hannah brought up her son Samuel to Eli, and with him “three bullocks, one ephah of flour, and a bottle (goat skin)” of <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi> into the house of the Lord at Shiloh. In the tenth chapter of the same book we have <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi> again mentioned in a similar manner. Samuel told Saul he should meet three men going to God at Bethel, one carrying three kids, one three loaves of bread, and another a bottle (goat-skin) of <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi>. And again in chapter twenty-five we have the remarkable and natural account of a present of two goat-skins (the cask or keg of those times) of <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi> made by the lady Abigail to David—(taken from the store of wine they were using at their sheep shearing)—which present David gladly accepted. Now, had David been a Teetotaller or Prohibitionist, would he not have refused it as a thing accursed?</p>
         <p>Farther: <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi>, the fermented juice of the grape, was by Divine command used in the most sacred services of God’s worship. The lambs offered continually every day at morning and. evening sacrifice were offered with the fourth part of a <hi rend="italic">hin</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi> for a “drink offering” which is also expressly named as “a sweet savour unto the Lord.” Thus, also it was—throughout the bigger monthly sacrifices of the year (with a ram and a bullock), a drink offering of <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi> continually to the Lord. (Exodus xxix. 38–46, Numbers xv., xxviii.)</p>
         <p>In Psalm civ. 156, <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi> is said “to make glad the heart of man,” being also Divinely linked with “oil,” and with “bread which strengthens man’s heart;”—the three essential elements of an Eastern banquet; the object being to set forth the bouuty of God’s provision for man.</p>
         <p>Throughout the history of the Bible we find that wine (<hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi>) was used on festive and joyous occasions, because of its agreeable and exhilarating properties and, also, that man did use it to excess. It is this excess alone that is condemned and not use. It was even provided, for those of the Israelites who resided at distance from Jerusalem, that on the yearly going thither to worship, they should carry their tithes in money:— “And thou shalt bestow that money (there) for what thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine (<hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi>) or for strong drink, or for whatever thy soul desireth; and thou shalt eat there before the Lord thy God and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household (Deut. xiv. 25, 26). Here was Divine sanction for the use of wine and strong drink, dangerous and tempting as they are. As a good divine formerly wrote on this passage, “What was to protect the drinkers against excess in the use? Their faith in the presence of God, and their accountability to him; they were to eat <hi rend="italic">before the Lord</hi>. This is the sole and effectual protection against every temptation arising out of the use of any good creature of God.” Even as St. Paul counsels— “Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory God.” (1 Cor. x. 31.)</p>
         <p>John Hosking cites from Leviticus X, (as if it were a positive command like— “Thou shalt not steal,”)— “Do not drink wine (<hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi>)” But he omits to give the reason of that sentence. Thus, after the sin and awful public death of the two priests, Nadab and Abihu, it is written, “The Lord spake unto Aaron saying, do not drink wine nor strong drink (<hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">shechar</hi>), thou nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die.” From this it is clear, that <hi rend="italic">Yayin</hi>, and other drinks, were commonly used by the Jews.</p>
         <p>I have heard some shallow short-sighted persons confidently affirming that wine and alcohol were not creatures of God! and, therefore, not included in St. Paul’s assertion,—that “Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.” (1 Tim., iv., 4) Nothing, with them, extracted by man from any natural product is a creature of God! Of course, not sugar, nor any of the many good things we have for food, and clothing, and for medicine, separated from their natural compounds.</p>
         <p>In one of the letters in your paper, some one, writing on this subject, has chosen John the Baptist for his exemplar and lawgiver. I, however, with the Christian Church, regard Jesus as such; and would remind that writer of John’s own solemn words,— “He must increase, but I must decrease.” Our Lord, too, placed himself in contradistinction to John, saying, “John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He hath a devil: the Son of Man is come, eating and drinking, and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man; a wine-bibber; a friend of publicans and sinners; but wisdom is justified of all her children” (Luke vii., 33).</p>
         <p>I once told one of those paid, noisy, strolling, itinerant teetotal (or, now, Prohibitionist) lecturers that I consider <hi rend="italic">alcohol</hi> as one of the choicest gifts of God to man; that I placed it together with the printing press in the very van of all his blessings: but, unhappily, man, in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> matters, too often perverted the blessing into a curse. And so I say now, after many years’ <hi rend="italic">experience</hi>; and if I too am called “a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber,” and farther identified with “publicans and sinners”—by the “unco guid” and teetotal party—I shall not complain. “If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household”.—I am, &amp;c,</p>
