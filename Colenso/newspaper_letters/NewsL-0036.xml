            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Through the Electoral Roll for the town of Napier, which appeared in your last Saturday’s “Herald,” I am again reminded of a duty which I have to fulfil. A self-imposed one it is true, and one that would have been long before this attended to had not my time been very fully occupied. I mean the present state of the <hi rend="italic">Electoral Roll</hi>; or the number of voters of this Province. I believe, Sir, that you are aware I attended the Revising Officer’s Court each day of his sitting, and heard him go through the whole of the Roll. And, in the first place, I feel bound to state, that that gentleman exerted his utmost powers <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to strike out any claimant; a matter, I assure you, by no means so easy <hi rend="italic">legally</hi> as (I dare say) three fourths of the electors think. He had heard of my having striven to arouse the public mind to a proper sense of their electoral rights; and, while he did not wonder at the apathy exhibited, (which, he said, was too common everywhere,) he remarked, that it would have been far better if an agent had been appointed to receive and inspect all claims before they were forwarded to the Registration Officer.</p>
         <p>And now, through you, Mr. Editor, I wish to acquaint the electors of the Province of three things:—1. That many of their claims were made in a very loose and unsatisfactory manner,—some not signed by the claimant,—others not signed by a magistrate,—and many with a very faulty or incorrectly described title.—2. That had there been any opposition a large number would have been necessarily struck off.—3. That several are left on the roll <hi rend="italic">for this year only</hi>; as, if not amended, they will be struck off at the next revisal; of which public notice was given by the Revising Officer.</p>
         <p>If you can find room I will endeavour to give a pretty correct list of bad or untenable claims in law; all of which were sent in to the Registration Officer, and are merely allowed to remain on the roll for the present. You will see they are mostly bad through their vagueness or indistinctness: It is <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> to say:—</p>
         <p>Five acres west bank of Tukituki.</p>
         <p>Part of Mr. Smith’s purchase.</p>
         <p>Purchase from John Smith.</p>
         <p>Part of section No. 100. (<hi rend="italic">How much</hi>?)</p>
         <p>Moiety of section No. 100.</p>
         <p>On the east bank of Tukituki.</p>
         <p>40 acres, Mohaka. (<hi rend="italic">Number</hi> of application not stated )</p>
         <p>Application No. 200. (<hi rend="italic">Acreage</hi> not stated.)</p>
         <p>Town section No.  . (Number left blank!)</p>
         <p>Ditto. (When more than one claim.)</p>
         <p>Household and leasehold.</p>
         <p>Household and freehold.</p>
         <p>Freehold, Ruataniwha.</p>
         <p>Household, Napier.</p>
         <p>Two men living together, the one puts in, A.B., Stores,—–; —the other, C.D., Houses,—–; both proprietors being one.</p>
         <p>Any person already on the roll making a subsequent application, should state, whether such is additional,—</p>
         <p>or, an alteration,—</p>
         <p>or, an amendment,—</p>
         <p>or, a substitution for his <hi rend="italic">former</hi> claim; even when made for <hi rend="italic">another</hi> district than <hi rend="italic">that </hi>of the former claim.</p>
         <p>All claims above one should be numbered,—1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.</p>
         <p>Persons of the same name (as John Smith) should clearly specify themselves, by adding trade, or calling, or by Senior, Junior, tertius, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Every claimant should bear in mind, that he has formally to sign his name twice to his application, (<hi rend="italic">besides</hi> his statement made in full including his name in the body of the application,) and that one of his signatures must be made before a Magistrate. So that his name must in every case be written three times on each application. J. Lamb of Porangahau was struck off because the declaration (part of the application) was not signed; and J. Heslop of Puketapu was struck off, because his application was neither signed nor declared! and so on with others. Claimants should also bear in mind, 1. that if their purchases or properties have only been recently acquired or occupied, (within six months,) their claim is invalid—2. that if they are foreigners, they must first become naturalised, or, their claim is not good.</p>
         <p>And, lastly, I will state, (as my own pnvate opinion,) that claimants who are on the Roll, and who may have disposed of their properties which formerly qualified them, in making a fresh application (and which may be in a new District) should state, that they were no longer entitled to their former claims. At all events such would look well and wear an honest face.</p>
         <p>I should not omit to add that the Revising Oflicer stated he had sent to the Land and Survey Office for a map of the town to aid him in his investigations, but that such was refused. I believe, however, that the head of those departments was not there. Of course the Revising Officer could have issued a summons compelling both production and attendance. The public are not a little indebted to the clerk of the District Court (Mr. Grindell), who very kindly ran to and fro making several necessary enquiries, through which several names were allowed to remain.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, Mr. Editor, allow me also to add that, having <hi rend="italic">again</hi> come forward publicly in this electoral matter, I shall hope henceforth to take it more easily. I first wrote a “tract” about it; I next wrote a warning letter in your paper; I subsequently advertised (at my own expence) a public meeting, to organise a committee to look after such matters, and attended it with a few others, and failed; and last, I have spent several cold hours in the open Court with the Revising Officer, which has caused me to trouble you now with this long letter, as a kind of finish to an onerous public duty.</p>
         <p>		I am, Sir,</p>
         <p>		Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">		William Colenso</hi>.</p>
         <p> Napier, Nov. 20.</p>
