         <p>“The deil’s no sae black as he’s ca’d”</p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I have been not a little grieved during the past fortnight, in seeing so many bitter remarks and wild statements made in both of our local papers concerning Te Kooti; written, too, by their respective Editors as well as by anonymous writers. I venture, therefore, once more into the arena (in the cause of Truth), hoping to be able to say—or, rather, to repeat—a few words upon this subject, which are highly needful to be borne in mind when considering or writing on the same, and which, I regret to say, seem to have been wholly forgotten. </p>
         <p>Before, however, that I do so, I would make one remark, namely, that I should have come out earlier had the writers of those anonymous and malevolent letters, which have appeared in our Napier papers, possessed the common fairness, the manliness, of putting their names to their letters (if, indeed, more than one have really been engaged in writing them); for I have a great and a growing dislike to all cloaked anonymous writing, which too often is closely allied to the skulking cowardly shooting of a man from behind a bush with a crape mask over the face! and, as a rule, I never answer, never notice any such effusions when directed towards myself. Such seem to me to be un-English,—that is, against the good old rule of our forefathers, of “all fair and above board.”</p>
         <p>Possibly, however, at Election times (such being a kind of Saturnalia, Carnival, or Free-licence time,) anonymous letters may be permitted,— “for the fun of the thing,” as the boys say; but, sir, there is a vast difference between Comedy and Tragedy; between writing for “fun” and laughter, and writing traducing “the powers that be” and howling for human blood!</p>
         <p>And yet, though I have said, that had I certainly known the writers I should have come out earlier to meet them; still, I should not have done so if I found that they belonged to one or more of those 4 classes, viz.—</p>
         <p>1. A venal hireling scribbler.</p>
         <p>2. One who had largely suffered through loss of relatives, &amp;c., in those sad times of war (long past).</p>
         <p>3. One known to be full of hatred to the Maori people.</p>
         <p>4. A new and ignorant hand, who really knew nothing about it.</p>
         <p>For I have no time to waste on such persons.</p>
         <p>To return: Some 12–14 years ago I wrote pretty fully on this subject, in several successive letters in the columns of your paper, (and for your kindness at that time in publishing them I would again publicly thank you). Fortunately, may I not say, it was a subject with which I was well acquainted from beginning to end; possibly more so than anyone at present here among us. My situation at that time and for some years previous (official and private,) was highly favorable to my obtaining; the most correct information, and I was also in a position to consider and weigh events calmly, <hi rend="italic">ab initio</hi>,—a highly needful qualification. </p>
         <p>I purpose, therefore, on the present occasion, reproducing a portion of what then appeared in the columns of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Herald</hi>; and I am the more inclined to do so from the very large number of settlers and townsmen who have since those years (1869–1871) joined us: Moreover, adding, (1) that what I then publicly wrote could not be gainsaid; and (2) what I then ventured to point out as the proper steps to be taken by the Government, I rejoice to have lived to see accomplished—though late Governments, as well as individuals, too often only learn through long (and it may be bitter) experience.</p>
         <p>On the 9th April, 1869, I wrote thus.—<note xml:id="ftn44" place="foot" n="44"> This letter is reproduced above—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">A Letter to the Editor of the “Hawke’s Bay Herald,” on the kind of policy necessary to be shewn towards the Maoris.</hi>
               </p>
         <p>“A word in season.”— “A time to speak.” 	<lb/>“Can ye not discover the signs of the times?”</p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Herald</hi> of this day your article concludes with these words: “All that is wanted is <hi rend="smallcaps">confidence</hi>, the want of which shuts out capital and labour, and impairs the energies of all.” These are true words, and to them I heartily assent. But how is this confidence to be brought about? First, we must have <hi rend="italic">peace</hi>; a true, substantial, firm, and lasting peace; from this will naturally spring confidence, and mark, <hi rend="italic">from this only</hi>. To this end let us all (Governor, Government, and people) be determined to do two things: 1.—To do justice; 2—To acknowledge error. </p>
         <p>1. To do justice—prompt and quick, even and fair, common-sense, not tedious legal justice. “Do ye to others as ye would they should do to you” if you were in their place. </p>
         <p>2. To acknowledge error, frankly and fully, wherever and whenever such has unfortunately been done; even to the retracing of our steps if needful and possible. (Let us not think too highly of ourselves as the “superior,” unerring race, adorned with a thousand highflown superlatives of our own inventing! Let us remember the fable of the man sitting astride on a lion, and the lion’s truthful remark. Let us endeavour to consider our political conduct in the light of God’s truth,—to which scrutinising light it will have to be submitted.) </p>
         <p>In order to this:—</p>
         <p>I. Let the war be immediately and everywhere stopped. </p>
         <p>II. Let a truce be proclaimed. </p>
         <p>III. Let an accredited messenger be sent from the Governor to the Maori King Tawhiao (not as king, but as the acknowledged head of many great tribes) to ask his aid towards making peace; and from him to the various Hauhau leaders; and a similar messenger to the chiefs of the principal friendly Maori tribes. The basis of such peace to be:—1. A general amnesty. 2. The return of all (nominally) confiscated lands, subject to certain conditions; such as, on the one side, all useful surveys and substantial improvements to be repaid; on the other, certain spots which it is necessary should be retained to be paid for. 3. Common freedom to all religions however absurd. </p>
         <p>IV. Let Peace Commissioners be appointed from both sides, and a place be mutually arranged for their meeting. </p>
         <p>V. Let powers be given to them to settle equitably our difficulties, and all great vexed questions. </p>
         <p>If this is done, and the British Commissioners be fit and high-minded men—men of comprehensive views, and able to grasp the whole subject,—and if all the terms then and there agreed to be hereafter honestly and promptly carried out,—then, I venture to prophesy a firm and lasting peace to the Colony of New Zealand; otherwise you will not, cannot have it—at least for a long generation, a long and weary time of bloodshed and misery to both races: and, note well, that such a peace so obtained by conquering or destroying isolated tribes, whenever that may be, <hi rend="italic">will not be lasting. </hi>
               </p>
         <p>I have long entertained those views; I now openly avow them. I know, in doing so, I shall be assailed by the unthinking, with—</p>
         <p>1. What of the murders, atrocities, massacres, and cannibalism? </p>
         <p>2. What of the present numerous semi-military bands? </p>
         <p>3. What of the expense and loss? </p>
         <p>4. What of our British name and reputation?</p>
         <p>I reply, to the first question—Who began the war with the “Hauhaus?” Who unjustly treated them—men, women, and children—by illegal wholesale banishment without trial? Who, on those Chatham Island “prisoners” returning to their own lands, in a most creditable, and gallant, and peaceful manner, foolishly and insanely, and without authority, attempted to capture and destroy them! instead of bringing them bread and water, and giving them the right hand and welcoming them back? Who carried on the war against them <hi rend="italic">in Maori fashion</hi>? Quietly mark this, and note—they have (<hi rend="italic">for the first time with us</hi>) also carried on the war against us and our Maori allies in Maori fashion, which we call murder, massacre, and atrocities (and so deceive ourselves, as if such were really different from our own “civilised” mode of warfare)! but hitherto we have only begun to know what it is; and note well, I beg, that to the present time hunted “Hauhaus” have not retaliated upon a single European living quietly on lands fairly purchased or leased. We have already killed something like seven or eight to one; besides inflicting irretrievable loss and evil. Moreover, fanatical outbreaks and rebellious <hi rend="italic">emeutes</hi>, everywhere occurring in this world’s sad history, are never rigorously revenged. </p>
         <p>To the second question, I reply—The sooner they are disbanded the better for the colony. </p>
         <p>To the third—Bear it; it can be borne to restore peace and confidence; it is by far the better, the easier, and the cheaper load. </p>
         <p>To the fourth—It will gain additional lustre, which ten years war and eventual success will never bring it. Our Maori foe cannot, will not reflect tauntingly upon it, as we have driven them from all their strongholds, and killed seven or eight to one. </p>
         <p>Now just consider, how much of that I then ventured to point out (and for which I was then so inconsiderately laughed at by not a few,) how much of that has only recently been accomplished!</p>
         <p>Again, in 1871, (on the occasion of the execution here of Kereopa,) I wrote:<note xml:id="ftn45" place="foot" n="45"> These passages are taken from <hi rend="italic">Fiat justitia</hi> published in the <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> and republished in 1871 as a booklet—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
         <p>Perhaps in no one thing has our Government lost influence with the Maoris more during the last few years than in this—their perpetual hunting and slaying of the helpless ones in the interior under the miserable subterfuge of pursuing Te Kooti! We,<hi rend="bold"> </hi>the early missionaries to this people, had the utmost difficulty in bringing the native tribes to leave off their seeking recompense for offences in this kind of way—by armed murdering prowling bands. Eventually, however, Christianity triumphed, and it was put down everywhere. Now, however, the Government has revived it, and they, I fear, will bye-and-bye find out their very serious error. But their doing so has caused the natives to think and talk and brood over their wrongs more than ever. Look, for a moment, at that last sad case (one of many similar ones,) reported in your paper a few weeks ago: of the murderous band of mercenary bloodhounds surrounding a small village by night, and shooting down suddenly and unexpectedly 6 unoffending natives (3 men and 3 women) and wounding others! Were these British subjects ? No one <hi rend="italic">here</hi> lamented them; no Christian female settler even said, How shocking! But, had such a deed been done by the Prussians when overrunning France, all England would have rung with the atrocity, and our Napier papers would have copied it—but these, alas! were Hauhaus!</p>
         <p>Our Premier, the Hon. Mr. Fox, on the 7th ult., in the House of Representatives, moved an address to the Queen respecting the melancholy death of Bishop Patteson, which address concludes in these words:— “And we pray that your Majesty may long live as the protector of the weak and defenceless in every part of the world.”— To which good words I respond heartily, Amen. But, “Charity begins at home;” and our Premier might have thought of those wretched “weak and defenceless” Maories in the mountains of New Zealand, so long harassed and hunted and killed by the mercenaries of the Government. There was a time when he could speak eloquently in their defence, as “men of like passions with ourselves.” As it is, such can only remind one of what Dickens so forcibly tells us of Mrs. Jellyby and her telescopic philanthropy for educating the African children of Borrioboola-Gha, while her own family around her were utterly without it!</p>
         <p>Why it is, that the ministers of our various Christian churches have not long ago stood up unitedly in the defence of the oppressed, I cannot divine. In rude ancient times, the bishops, abbots, priors, priests, and presbyters, were always found in the van, loudly denouncing all such ill-usage, even when made by their own nobles and kings. But then the clergy led and tended and taught their flocks, being independent of them; now, alas! they follow in the ruck, and preach to please their sleepy fat sheep (as we have seen in the clergy of the American slave-holding States,) being wholly dependent on them.</p>
         <p>On July 27th the late Dr Selwyn, then Bishop of Lichfield, spoke thus on the same subject, in his place in the Houseof Lords. (This was also republished by you in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Herald</hi>.)</p>
         <p>In the house of Lords on July 27, the affairs of New Zealand were brought under discussion:—</p>
         <p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Granville</hi> trusted that the difficulties of the Colony, and the irritation in it, would only be temporary, and that <hi rend="italic">the Colonial</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Government</hi> would learn the real nature of the responsibility which it had assumed and <hi rend="italic">adopt those measures of conciliation towards the natives which would put an end to the state of brigandage</hi> rather than war which prevailed in it.</p>
         <p>The Bishop of <hi rend="smallcaps">Lichfield</hi> thought he should be wanting in his duty towards the colonists of New Zealand, as well as towards the natives of that country, if he were not to address a few words to their lordships on the present occasion…. Every New Zealander desired to be a faithful subject of Her Majesty until that unfortunate idea of the Queen’s right to the pre-emption of land took the precedence over every other idea, and the whole notion of government was lost in the simple question of, in what manner and by what quickest possible means the property of the soil in New Zealand should be transferred from the natives to the Crown. Their great mistake in New Zealand had been their asserting from the beginning a sovereignty over a country which they could not govern. They had repeated all the errors committed in Ireland centuries ago, and had punished crime by the confiscation of land. Large tracts had been taken from the natives, and so-called military settlers were placed in them to defend the district. On one occasion he knew that a dealer came to these settlements and bought up the land of those supposed defenders of the country, who went away leaving the place undefended, and then a number of peaceful settlers came instead of those military men and scattered themselves over the district, and although they were exposed to every kind of danger, they were never injured because they were living in the King’s country. In other parts, indeed, where peculiarly exasperating circumstances had occurred the case had been different. The men who had done all the mischief on the east coast and at Poverty Bay were men who had been carried off as prisoners to the Chatham Islands [and that without any trial, or investigation whatsoever, W.C.] where they were told that if they conducted themselves well at the end of two years they would be set at liberty. There they behaved in the most exemplary manner, but at the expiration of the two years they were informed that they were not to be set at liberty, whereupon a look of despair came over them, as if every hope they had of life were cut off. They had been placed on lonely and remote islands, they had looked forward to the day of their emancipation, and with that view they had behaved exceedingly well. But when they saw no hope left to them, was it surprising that they took matters into their own hands and escaped? Those men went back into their own country, where they were followed up by a military force, driven into the woods, their places stormed, and their houses burnt. The most unwise thing of all was that, in spite of warning, the military officers who had followed up those escaped prisoners went and settled down on the land which had just been taken from them. The New Zealanders would not be like the Scotch, the Irish, or the Welsh, if under such circumstances they had not resisted these excursions…. There were a few persons among the settlers, as there were also a few among the New Zealanders, who would at times rush into violence but the great majority of the colonists lived in peace and harmony with their native fellow-subjects, and their good will was in a great degree reciprocated by the natives.</p>
         <p>And this is the ground on which I again take my stand; not that kindly brought forward yesterday in your paper by “Imprimatur,” of acting Christianly towards Te Kooti,—high and correct and praiseworthy though that be; but one that is still much higher, older, and universal, viz. that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Justice</hi>; strict Justice (even as I had chosen for a title to my pamphlet— “<hi rend="italic">Fiat Justitia</hi>,”—let Justice be done). Let us learn, though late, to act justly in this matter; bear in mind Bishop Selwyn’s noble and truthful words; “bury the hatchet” and, as loyal peace-loving people, support the Government. I, for one, (and there are many with me,) heartily thank the newly-arrived Governor and the Native Minister Mr Bryce for what they have done in the matter of the General Amnesty—<hi rend="italic">excluding no one</hi>. And I deem this last political act of Mr Bryce, of so publicly so freely so genuinely pardoning the unfortunate the wronged Te Kooti, as the very best of all his public political acts known to me.</p>
         <p>“There’s a heart that leaps, with a burning glow, 	<lb/>  The wronged and the weak to defend,	<lb/>And strikes ‘as soon for a trampled foe,’	<lb/>  As it does for a soul-bound friend.—	<lb/>— ’Tis a rich rough gem, deny it who can;	<lb/>  And this is the heart of an Englishman.”</p>
         <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">		William Colenso</hi>.</p>
         <p>P.S.—The whole of the foregoing extracts, with a great deal more of authentic official high and interesting matter bearing on this subject, was also published by me at that time in a closely-printed pamphlet (alluded to above) of 23 pages; and as there seems to be a large amount of ignorance abroad, respecting the doings of those unhappy days,—and as there may be many among us who would like to know more of what really took place,—I shall send 3 copies of the said pamphlet to the Reading-room in the Athenæum, and 3 copies to the Working-men’s Club—it will well repay perusal.—W.C.</p>
