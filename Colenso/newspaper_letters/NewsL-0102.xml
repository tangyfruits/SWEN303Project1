      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I note what you have said in your issue of yesterday (Tuesday) concerning the Olive tree and the <hi rend="italic">tawa</hi> tree being one: viz.— “We cannot put our hand upon our authority, but we have a distinct recollection of reading somewhere a letter from England, in reply to a question relating to the introduction of the Olive tree, that the best and speediest way of naturalising the Italian Olive would be to graft upon the native <hi rend="italic">tawa</hi> tree, which was stated to be a true Olive.”</p>
      <p>I know nothing of “the letter from England,” mentioned by you, nor of its writer; but I suppose that (if your “distinct recollection” is correct) it must have been a <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> one,—written, very likely, in consequence of so much having been said and published of late years about the introduction of the European Olive into New Zealand, as the basis of a future lucrative article of use and of commerce; and if so written, then assuredly it was not written by any authority, whether Botanical or practical Horticulturist, as it contains the great error of the <hi rend="italic">tawa</hi> tree being an Olive, and of the grafting successfully of the Olive upon it! For, as I have already casually shown in your columns of yesterday, there is no Natural or Systematical connexion whatever between the two trees, or their Natural Orders; indeed they are farther apart in the Natural System of Botany, than a cabbage is from a cucumber.</p>
      <p>I had early discovered 3 species of <hi rend="italic">Olea </hi>(or true olive) in New Zealand; one at the Bay of Islands, one at Wairarapa, and one at Patea in the mountainous interior, (this last in 1847,) and had severally sent specimens of them to Sir W. Hooker, the Director of the Royal Gardens at Kew. And I believe that I, myself, was the originator, or the first writer, of the “<hi rend="italic">grafting</hi>” part of that statement mentioned by you; which I will now endeavour to show.</p>
      <p>Nearly 20 years ago, (in 1864,) Sir G. Grey, then Governor of New Zealand, acting with the Imperial Commissioners appointed to carry out the New Zealand Exhibition, held at Dunedin in 1865, officially assigned to me the Public Essay “on the Botany of the N. Island of New Zealand,” (and, also, the Essay “on the Maori Race,”)—and, in Part III of that Botanical Essay, in considering the Economic Botany of New Zealand, I brought forward several N.Z. plants, which, probably, would be found useful in the Arts, (a few I had, myself, proved,) with observations on them, and also on the various soils, and Climates of N.Z., &amp;c., &amp;c., suited to plants of commercial value worthy of being introduced into the Colony; and, among other remarks, I said, that “the European Olive might be advantageously grafted upon the several indigenous olives of the Island.” (Essay, ¶ 32.) This essay was also republished in its entirety (but without the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>) in 1869, in the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> volume of the “Transactions of the New Zealand Institute.”</p>
      <p>At the time of my writing of that Essay, I scarcely can suppose there were a dozen persons in the Colony who knew of our possessing an indigenous and true Olive in our woods; or, if they had happened to have heard of it, (from Sir W. Hooker’s early publications of my Botanical discoveries in the “London Journal of Botany,” 1841-1849, and in other works of his,) they did not really know the trees themselves in our forests. Subsequently, however, through the publication of Dr. Sir Joseph Hooker’s “Hand-Book of the New Zealand Flora,” in 1866, and its extensive circulation here in the Colony, our possessing species of the Olive in our woods became known; and yet, (strange to say!) among all the immense amount of <hi rend="italic">talk</hi>, aye, and of writing, too, about the introduction of the European Olive into the Colony (both inside Parliament and outside), I have never once noticed any one even hinting or alluding to the far easier and ancient and more speedily profitable mode of its early and successful propagation in the Colony,—viz. by its being <hi rend="italic">grafted</hi> on the plentiful wild olive-stocks which are so very common here. One would have thought, (even supposing our Representative men to be generally ignorant of Natural Science,) that some of them must, at least, have often heard of Paul’s striking natural imagery, in his Epistle to the Romans, (XI. 17.) about <hi rend="italic">the grafting of the olive</hi>; and that the bare recollection of this would have sufficed to give them an idea, or working notion of the thing! But then, as I said before, probably they did not even know of the existence of the wild olive tree amongst us.</p>
      <p>And here, Sir, you, or some others, may justly enough say,— “Why did I not write to some of the papers of the day, and so inform them?” Were I to keep doing this, respecting the many useful, new, profitable, and other things, I have formerly written and published, on religious and other matters, I might do nothing else. I continually see, in Newspapers, Books, Sermons, and Colonial Almanacs, the same old, often exposed, and obsolete errors constantly being hashed, and vamped and served-up anew! arising from ignorance or carelessness, or forgetfulness; and I am sometimes driven to reflect— </p>
      <p>       “Since ignorance is bliss,<lb/>   ’Tis folly to be wise.”</p>
      <p>In conclusion, I may briefly mention that my collecting, early last week while in the forests, berries of the olive and of the tawa trees, and bringing them with me to Napier, (with many other fruits and plants) to show at the meeting of the Hawke’s Bay Philosophical Institute on Monday night was wholly irrespective of what you had said in the leading article in your paper of that same evening. Indeed, I had got all my specimens put in order and packed up for taking down to the Athenæum, during the morning of that day; it was a highly curious and undesigned concurrence, or coincidence, and that was all. I am, &amp;c.,</p>

      <p>[Our thanks are due to Mr Colenso for the valuable information contained in the above letter. As most bush settlers are acquainted with the native names of trees, he would be adding to the obligation we are under to him if he would kindly furnish the names by which the New Zealand olive trees, most common in Hawke’s Bay forests, are known to the Maoris. Is the <hi rend="italic">maire</hi> an olive?—Ed. D.T.]</p>
