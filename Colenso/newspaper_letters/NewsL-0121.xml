         <p>No pleasure is comparable to the standing upon the vantage-ground of Truth. 		— Bacon,</p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your paper of this morning you have given your readers an interesting account of the Convent School Entertainment in the theatre last night,—of the music and singing, and of two Lectures by the Rev. Father Des Chesnais, on Public Opinion, Rationalism, &amp;c,—and no doubt the audience was well pleased.—– </p>
         <p>But I am not pleased with several of the Rev. Father’s scientific and historical statements, which I cannot but consider erroneous; and therefore I trouble you with this letter. I do not mean to take them all up, (you could not afford me the requisite room,) only a few of the more prominent ones; and these I will briefly notice in a few plain words,—as I only seek the truth.</p>
         <p>1. Of the Copernican system of astronomy, Father Chesnais says,— “As a proof that the Catholic Church had always believed in the rotundity of the Earth, he quoted the instance of the frescos in the Vatican, executed by Raphael <hi rend="italic">over a hundred years before the inception of the Copernican system</hi> of astronomy;” Well: Copernicus was born in 1472, and Raphael in 1482, 10 years <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Copernicus. At the early age of 23 Copernicus proceeded to Rome, where he was kindly received by the celebrated astronomer Regiomontanus, and appointed to a chair of mathematics, and there pursued his astronomical studies, being also a churchman. </p>
         <p>2. Of the Mosaic Cosmogony, Father Chesnais says,— “That the Bible nowhere taught that the Earth was created in six days, and urged, that the days were periods of immense duration.” This is a modern invention reluctantly advanced by those theological critics who, driven to extremity by the numerous increasing and overwhelming Geological proofs, are obliged to adopt it; but it is against what the Bible plainly affirms and teaches. In its plain, purely historical, and calm narrative, such a metaphorical use of the word “day” is rendered impossible by the repeated phrase— “And evening was and morning was,” both forming one natural day. Nor can the circumstance, that on the fourth day only the sun was created to divide the day from the night, prove that the word “day” denotes, in the preceding verses, at least, an unlimited time; if it means day in one verse, it has the same signification throughout the whole narrative, or we should be obliged to take the day of Sabbath likewise as a “period of immense duration” of rest. How could the plants of the third “period of immense duration” have grown and prospered, if the sun obtained his power on the earth in the fourth “period” only? Whatever efforts have been made to prove that the days here represent “periods of immense duration” the advocates of this opinion have not been able to bring forward one single plausible argument; unless it be considered in harmony with the Biblical notions of Divine omnipotence, that God created the light, or the heaven, or the dry land, in a “period” of 50,000, or 100,000 years; of that omnipotence which “commands and it exists.” The term “evening and morning” describes indisputably the lapse of one complete day, or of four-and-twenty hours, and this cycle of hours elapses, even if there were no sun to mark it. Sun and moon do not make the day; they only govern it. And as there were days and nights before the creation of the sun and the moon, so there will be, at the end of time, light without the luminaries which diffuse it; as is distinctly stated, both in the Old and the New Testament. </p>
         <p>Father Chesnais “accounted for Moses using the terms ‘day and night’ by supposing that Moses saw six visions, each vision representing to him what took place during each of the long periods referred to.” Now wherever the Scriptures intend to describe visions, they are careful to introduce them in a manner that they are clearly distinguishable as such, and can never be confounded with plain history. The prophecies of Ezekiel offer so numerous instances of such visions, that it suffices simply to refer to that part of the Old Testament. The Biblical records are written in the ordinary style of human composition, for they were intended for the perusal and study of man. This ancient and orthodox principle must remain our supreme rule and guide. The first chapter of Genesis is, therefore not a “creative picture,” but a creative history; it presents not a series of prophetic “visions” or tableaux, but of acts and events; it is merely a simple prose narrative. </p>
         <p>3. Father Chesnais said,— “that all the miracles alleged to have been performed by Moses, were confirmed by the discoveries of modern Egyptologists, and that in particular, the miraculous passage of the Red Sea, as recorded in Exodus, was proved by Egyptian remains now in the British Museum.”—I simply deny this; mere oratorical display! </p>
         <p>4. Father Chesnais said, “that in the ancient times no man dared to speak against the established religion under pain of death. As a proof of his assertion he instanced Socrates, condemned to death by hemlock for speaking slightingly of the gods.”—I reply: (1) That Socrates was not so condemned, but for his being (as his accusers termed it) “a corruptor of Youth”: — that is, he taught them to think for themselves. It is true, the other charge was also brought against him, but Socrates triumphantly refuted it, silencing his accuser Meletus in the Court. As Xenophon says,— “As to the charge, that Socrates did not respect the gods whom the city respects;—what proof did they bring? For he was seen frequently sacrificing at home, and frequently on the public altars of the city.—Concerning celestial matters in general, he dissuaded every man from becoming a speculator how the Divine Power contrives to manage them; for he did not believe that those acted dutifully towards the gods, who inquired into things which they did not wish to make known.—But if any one desired to attain to what was beyond human wisdom, he advised him to study divination; for he said, that he who knew by what signs the gods give indications to men respecting human affairs, would never fail of obtaining counsel from the gods.” (<hi rend="italic">Memorabilia</hi>, lib., I, IV.) And much more to the same effect in Plato. (<hi rend="italic">Apology, Crito</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Phædo</hi>.) </p>
         <p>(2) That those “times alluded to in which no man dared to speak against the established religion under pain of death,”—were pre-eminently those of the dark middle-ages, when the thrice-accursed Inquisition, established and fostered by the Church of Rome, had full sway, and tortured and slaughtered her thousands and hundreds of thousands with cruel mockings and rejoicings! </p>
         <p>5. Father Chesnais said,— “He combatted the idea, that there was any conflict between Religion and Science, as exemplified by modern research on the one hand, and the Mosaic cosmogony on the other.”—To this I reply: (1) Between <hi rend="italic">true</hi> Religion and Science there is no conflict, as both proceed from the one source of truth—GOD: but (2) Between the religion and creeds of the Churches and Science there is great conflict, and <hi rend="italic">must ever be, until the several Churches alter their human Creeds</hi>. </p>
         <p>6. On two points I heartily agree with Father Chesnais: (1) “that public opinion depended upon the books and newspapers people read”:—<hi rend="italic">ergo</hi>, people will increasingly read, aye and <hi rend="italic">think</hi>; science, light, and truth will advance, and emancipate the nations.—(2) “That a higher state of civilisation than that now in existence was in existence before the flood.”—Yes: but say, <hi rend="italic">the time</hi> of the flood. As such an event as the Noachian (or general) deluge, has long been shown and scientifically <hi rend="italic">proved</hi>, never to have occurred.—I am, &amp;c., </p>

                  <hi rend="bold italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi>
                  <hi rend="bold"> 18 August.</hi>
               </p>
         <p>We reprint at Mr Colenso’s request the following letter from him to the editor of the Auckland <hi rend="italic">Freeman’s Journal</hi>, which was published in its issue of the 8th instant:— </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,— Yesterday I received from some unknown friend at Auckland a copy of your paper of July 18th, in which I find some animadversions of yours on what I had brought forward respecting the two astronomers, Regiomontanus and Copernicus, in a late public correspondence here between the Rev. Father Chesnais and myself. Permit me to say a few words thereon. </p>
         <p>1. I <hi rend="italic">now find</hi> that what I had said about the time of Regiomontanus is incorrect, and that what you have told us is right, and I have pleasure in doing so. At the same time I shall give you the respectable authority for my error in quotation. </p>
         <p>2. I would, however, observe (<hi rend="italic">in limine</hi>) that this error is but a trivial one; at most, my mention of Regiomontanus was immaterial, not at all affecting the main subject in dispute, in clause 1 of my letter, viz., the <hi rend="italic">time of the birth, &amp;c.</hi>, of Copernicus (and of Raphael), which you yourself have allowed to be correct. </p>
         <p>3. You state— “The reason why we have been so particular about the dates of his early life will be found in the following passage from Mr Colenso’s letter:— ‘At the early age of 28 (substitute 23) Copernicus proceeded to Rome, where he was kindly received by the celebrated astronomer Regiomontanus, and appointed to a chair of Mathematics, and there pursued his astronomical studies, being also a Church man.’ <hi rend="italic">Now, Regiomontanus died at Rome, aged 40, July 6th, 1476, when Copernicus was little more than three years of age.</hi> There is little pleasure in tripping up men of Mr Colenso’s age, but when they make statements such as the above they pass the limits of even charitable tolerance…. Here we may leave Mr Colenso.”</p>
         <p>4. I now give you my authority (to do so is my chief reason for writing this), viz., the last complete edition of the “Encyclopaedia Brittanica,” vol. VII., art. “Copernicus;” where it is said (<hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>):— “At the age of twenty-three Copernicus set out for Italy, and passed some time at Bologna, where he attended the prelections of the astronomer Dominico Maria, and also made some astronomical observations. He then proceeded to Rome, where he was kindly received by Regiomontanus, and honored with his friendship, as he had previously been with that of Professor Maria at Bologna. Here he was appointed to a chair of Mathematics, which he filled with much distinction, &amp;c., &amp;c.” </p>
         <p>5. But in all fairness to the editors of the “Encyc. Brit.,” I should also mention that this error of theirs (<hi rend="italic">as to date</hi>), which you have corrected, is also set right in their article on Regiomontanus (vol. XV, p. 391, art. “Muller,” &amp;c.), where it is said “He was born in 1436—he went to Rome (his second journey) in 1476 (where Pope Sixtus IV. had provided for him the Archbishopric of Ratisbon, and had sent for him to reform the calendar;)—but as he had found faults in the Latin translation of George de Trebizona, his son assassinated him on his journey thither; but others state that he died of the plague.” </p>
         <p>6. I could write a good deal more, but I forbear, not, however, on the account of “age” (as you courteously put it), for I had supposed—having been so taught—that “age” should bring wisdom. </p>
         <p>7. I may, however, briefly say that I should have willingly rejoined to Father Chesnais’ letter (and again have shown him where he was wrong), had he not written of me personally therein in the manner that he did, which seemed to me the more strange coming from a son of proverbially polite France! Therefore, I could not lower myself to reply. </p>
