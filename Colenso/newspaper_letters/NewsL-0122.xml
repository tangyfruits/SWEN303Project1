                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your paper of this morning you have another item respecting the “Maori Lexicon” and myself,—in addition to the telegram you gave us on Saturday last, 27th. And as there appears to be some error or confusion, or both, on the part of the late Actors in it (as reported), I write now to say, that I will at once place copies of the original official Parliamentary Paper respecting the said “Maori Lexicon,” in the Reading Room of the Athenæum, and of the Working-Men’s Club, Napier; and also in those of the Public Libraries at Hastings, Waipawa, Waipukurau and Wairoa, for public information—I am, &amp;c,</p>

         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—</p>
         <p>In your  article in the<hi rend="smallcaps">Daily Telegraph</hi> of this evening, writing on the “Seventy-mile Bush,” you say:—</p>
         <p>“The opening of the Seventy-mile Bush may be said to date from the time when Mr. Parke, then Chief Surveyor of the Province of Wellington, cut his way through the forest…. Previously to this the bush had never been penetrated by a European,” &amp;c.— —</p>
         <p>Permit me to correct this error. I, with my party of Maoris, first travelled through that Bush from Wairarapa to Manawatu (Ngaawapurua) in 1846; and subsequently every year, doown to 1853, I went over the same ground, in going my annual rounds, and in visiting those Maoris who were then living at two isolated villages (Ihuraoa and Te Hawera) nearly central in that long forest; and this I did either in my going to or returning from Wairarapa.</p>
         <p>The track (or rather course, unknown before even to Maoris of that early day,) was soon largely used by the Maoris, even to their driving of tame pigs from Table Cape for sale in Wellington town! there being no demand for them in all the intervening country.</p>
         <p>Here I may observe, that you will find these journeys of mine mentioned at page 69 of the little book on “the Ruahine range,” lately printed at your press.</p>
         <p>After 1853, Dr. Featherston, then Superintendent of the Province of Wellington, applied to me officially for a description, &amp;c., of my track through that forest, (this District being then a part of that Province,) which I made out and sent to him; and subsequently Mr. Parke, then a Government Surveyor of Wellington, came through on my old beaten track, chaining it, &amp;c., &amp;c. He kindly gave me a copy of his rough sketch route, telling me, that it agreed with mine; which I also recognised.</p>
         <p>Another observation of yours in the same article, I should like to remark on; namely, where you say,—</p>
         <p>“Bishop Colenso shook the theological world and thrust the Zulu assegai through it by pointing out that the simplest arithmetic threw doubt upon the Exodus, since it was impossible for such vast numbers of cattle and sheep to find pasturage in the desert, where scarce a blade of grass grows, and the streams are but feeble tricklings. Forestry arises to confute Bishop Colenso, by replying that the present aspect of the desert is caused by the absence of trees. Of old, when there were extensive forests in those districts, there was doubtless plenty of pasturage and water.”</p>
         <p>Here, I fear, the warmth of your feelings or the height of your Editorial imagination, in favour of your favourite theme—Forestry, have led you astray. I, on my part, feel the more inclined to write on this error of yours, from the fact of my being a firm believer in the arithmetic and teachings of Bishop Colenso respecting all those legends and tales of the ancient Jews, (which, I may further say, I have also proved to be correct, and which have not and cannot be logically refuted,) as well as from my being his nearest relative living, and therefore doubly ready to take up any charge of that nature against his teaching,—or, rather, the only reasonable deductions from those given premises.—</p>
         <p>To return: Did it never occur to you, that if that lonely sterile desert country was so well-filled anciently with “extensive forests and plenty of pasturage and water” (as you say), that in the event of those forests having been all entirely consumed by the wandering Israelites, or by others after them,—the rich soil that bore that fine vegetation would have remained? Geology, or even Physical Geography, answers this.—</p>
         <p>Again: What did the ancient Israelites themselves, the inhabitants and traversers of that Country and therefore well acquainted with it, what did they say of it? Let me quote a passage or two from their ancient books; which I allow were in all probability never written by Moses (as is still popularly supposed), nor by any one of his early day,—not till nearly 1000 years after him; but should you be ready to contend that they were,—Well, “all right!” I accept it; but all the worse for you and your argument!—</p>
         <p>What of their early and common “murmurings,” owing to their great want of food and water?—</p>
         <p>What of the Quails and the Manna, this latter, too, daily supplied during their “40 years.”</p>
         <p>What of their want of water? and the wondrous supplies! and the marvellous legend of the peripatetic and ambulating rock (even adopted by Paul), that followed them all their long and lonely way during those 40 years?</p>
         <p>And, what of those fearful and telling statements,—so often and feelingly mentioned and dwelt upon by both early and late prophets,—concerning that “desert land and waste howling wilderness;” and “that great and terrible wilderness wherein the fiery serpents and scorpions and drought, where there was no water,” &amp;c (<hi rend="italic">Deut. </hi>8, 15.)</p>
         <p>I could both quote and say more, much more, on this subject, but this, I think, will suffice.—I am, &amp;c.,</p>
