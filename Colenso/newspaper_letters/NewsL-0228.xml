      <p>The Hon. Mr. Bowen asked the Attorney-General what steps had been taken towards the publication of the late William Colensoâ€™s Maori lexicon, and to whose custody the manuscript has been confided? The Minister stated that no steps had yet been taken to publish, and that the document was in the custody of the Native Minister. He would bring the matter before his colleagues, and subsequently give further information.</p>
