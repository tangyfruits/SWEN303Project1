               </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>, —I have recently returned to town from a long and peaceful sojourn in the Seventy-mile Bush. While there I was ever and anon being startled by the sudden screams of the distant railway whistle, (often heard resounding through the forest on a dark and dreary windy night,) and by the feverish and symptomatic apprehensive cries issuing from the diurnal Newspaper press of Napier; but I soon got used to both; yet thinking the latter the worse of the two and wholly uncalled for and unreasonable. Owing however to them, the above lines from Shakespeare often came rushingly into my mind, —with not a few others from our old writers equally applicable. </p>
         <p>You, too, (permit me to say,) unconsciously added fuel to the fire, in so solemnly informing us, that a Napier parson and his old charwoman or sextonness, had both had in one night, a revelation or nightmare or dream of war bloody war having begun! For this, unhappy I got regularly chaffed, as I could not tell the many,—Why, Whence, or by Whom such a portentous and dreadful revelation had come to them;—whether from above or below,—whether through those naughty <hi rend="italic">seances</hi> (of which all had heard), or through some better or worse channel: and this, I regret to say, is still unsolved. </p>
         <p>You, Mr Editor (as a long resident in Napier) as well as myself, have seen and passed through several Scares. If habit, as some say, “is second nature,” we should by this time have become pretty well used to Scares of almost every political and human kind or invention, albeit often accompanied by great screaming and thundering, and by frightful alarms and dire portents—ingeniously or stupidly got up for the nonce, after the fashion of the old story of “the 3 Black Crows.”</p>
         <p>Let me see; let me count over on the tips of my fingers a few of those more prominent Napier (or Hawke's Bay) Scares. Not to go too far back,—there was the predicted terrific tidal wave, that was to swallow us up quick; what a still greater excess of intense fear that ogre would have caused us, if the late terrible Java earthquake (that gave (?) those fiery sunsets last summer) had preceded it! There was the night invasion of the Hauhaus, and the dreadful state of excitement caused by some one seeing a light at night on the Western Spit beach, where the late Wm. Morris and his two travelling companions to the town, being benighted, were quietly camping and snoring. There was the general Vegetable blight Scare, that destroyed all our Cabbages and Turnips and Brocoli, including even the once universal wild “Maori Cabbage.” There was the malignant Swamp and Fever Scare. There was the Small Pox Scare. There was the Harbor Scare,—terrible while it lasted, and of which the ghost is not yet laid. There has also been several Election Scares, which may also be repeated—such being so profitable, you know! And now, to crown them all, is this last,—the big Russian, or Perilous-need-of-Defences Scare! And this last one happening, and enduring, too! under the sweet and powerful public music of M. Remenyi, so highly extolled in the very same Napier Papers. Alas! Orpheus was anciently said to have had better luck with his stringed instrument among the wild beasts of the forest in his day. Verily, ye men of Napier and of Hawke’s Bay, it seems to me that you are getting more and more childish and timorous, (at least outwardly so,) and growing unreasonable—like a cow's tail downwards! If you don’t take care, of you ere long it may be chronicled—<hi rend="italic">ante tubam</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">trepidat</hi>. </p>
         <p>I should however have told you, what it more particularly was that caused me far up in my quiet mountain solitudes to think so much of this present magnified huge and ugly Russian Scare; seeing that I had plenty there of far more pleasing matters to occupy both my time and attention; it was just this. A few days before I left Napier, I happened to open an old parcel of Botanical plates that I had received from London in 1855, and there I found a copy of the London “Times” Paper, of August 22, 1555, containing a full and particular and highly-graphic account of the attack by the combined fleets of England and France on Sweaborg—that grand old Russian fortress and town in the Baltic. This Paper I took with me to the woods, and there read and considered it; and now (with permission) I will give some literal extracts from it, which I am sure will be read with much interest by many of your readers, and may also be reasonably and profitably considered by them. Indeed, I should have sent the said Paper to you long ago for republication of this portion of it, but I thought,—Better, perhaps, wait, and let the mewings and whinings subside, and the witches’ cauldron (now in brewing) boil over, and so (in part) put out the fire of their own kindling.—</p>
         <p>“The Bombardment of Sweaborg.” <lb/>(From our own Correspondent.)</p>
         <p>Before entering into the details of the bombardment of Sweaborg it may be advisable to give your readers a brief description of the place itself, in order to render the following explanation fully intelligible. </p>
         <p>Sweaborg stands in the Gulf of Finland, three miles south-cast of Helsingfors. The fortifications extend over six islands, called Langorn, Lilla Swartoe, West Swartoe, East Swartoe, Vargon, and Gusvavstaard; the last five are connected by bridges and occupy a space of about 1,200 by 650 yards. Vargon is the capital, the strongest fortress, and also the central one. The works are of granite, and as massive as the foundations on which they stand, being, for the most part, constructions out of the solid rock. Sweaborg is said to mount 810 cannon, has casements for from 6,000 to 7,000 small arms, and barracks for a garrison of 12,000 men. </p>
         <p>In describing the bombardment of Sweaborg, I shall endeavour, as nearly as possible, to relate the facts in the order in which they actually occurred. </p>
         <p>On the 7th of August, at 9.30 a.m., signal was made from the flagship, “Outward and Icewardmost ships weigh.” The fleet, consisting of 9 British line-of-battle ships, 13 steam-frigates and sloops, 16 mortar vessels, and an equal number of gunboats, sailed from Nargen, and after a pleasant run of five hours anchored at a distance of about 5,000 yards from the fortress of Sweaborg. In the course of the same evening the French fleet joined, and immediately commenced throwing up a mortar battery on the island of Langorn, situated some 2,000 yards to the north of the cluster of five islands which form the principal part of the fortress of Sweaborg. During the 8th both fleets were busily employed preparing for action; the mortar vessels were towed into position, about 3,700 yards from the fortress, with 400 fathoms each of cable to “haul and veer on,” as circumstances might require. This arrangement proved of the greatest advantage, and much credit is due to the originators of this excellent idea. The line-of-battle ships remained in the same order they had at first anchored in. The steamers Magicienne, Vulture, and Euryalus took up a position in rear of the mortar vessels, for the purpose of being ready to give them and the gun-boats any assistance they might require. The Lightning and Locust were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to tow out any gun or mortar vessels that might be injured, or otherwise rendered incapable of remaining longer under fire; in fact, every possible arrangement having been made which prudence and foresight could suggest, the signal was made from the flagship at 7.15 in the morning of the 9th, “Gun and mortar vessels open fire with shell.” At 7.30 a.m the first mortar was fired, and taken up along the whole line, the gunboats running in to within 3,000 yards, and getting their range. The enemy returned our fire very briskly with red-hot shot and shell, but, although their range was good, the damage inflicted was comparatively trifling, owing, principally, to the excellent handling of the gunboats and mortar vessels, the former being continually on the move, and the latter hauling or veering on their 400-fathom cable, as soon as they found the Russian shot falling too close to be pleasant. At 10.20 the first Russian magazine exploded, and a fire broke out in the arsenal. About v noon a second magazine exploded; and at 12.15 a most terrific explosion took place, followed by a succession of minor ones. The force of this was so immense that a battery of guns <hi rend="italic">en barbette</hi> was literally blown to pieces by it. At 12.40 more magazines exploded. At this time the dockyards, arsenal, barracks, all the Government buildings, store-houses, &amp;c, were burning furiously. The sight was most grandly imposing. The yards and poops of the line-of-battle ships were crowded with the excited seamen, who cheered vociferously after every explosion, as only British sailors know how to cheer. To add to this frightful din, the liners Cornwallis, and Hastings, and steam frigate Amphion opened their broadsides at the same moment; and, as if to crown the whole, the Arrogant, Cossack, and Cruiser chimed in by commencing a heavy fire, with good effect, on a large body of troops which they chanced to espy on a small island to the eastward of the fortress. The cannonade continued with little abatement up to 8 o’clock p.m., when the gunboat recall was hoisted. Several of the mortar vessels were also found to be injured from the quick and incessant firing, and had to be brought out to undergo repairs: those, however, which were not damaged, still kept up their fire, in conjunction with the French mortar battery, until 10.30 p.m., at which hour the rocket boats from the fleet went in and kept up their part of the performance until daylight. The scene during the night was grand beyond description: the whole of Sweaborg appeared one mass of flame, the rockets and shells adding not a little to the awful splendour of the fiery landscape. </p>
         <p>At 5.30 a.m. on the 10th the fire again opened from our whole line, and continued throughout the day, at the end of which little appeared left to be done; all the mortars, French and English, were more or less injured. Some idea, however, of the services rendered by these vessels may be gathered from the fact that during the two days' bombardment not less than 1,000 tons of iron were thrown into a space of about half a mile in diameter, and upwards of a 100 tons of powder were expended. This, incredible as it may appear, applies to the English mortar vessels alone, and does not include the quantity (which was equally large in proportion) used by our gallant allies on that occasion. </p>
         <p>On Friday night, the 10th instant, the rocket boats again went in and played with great effect. On Saturday no fighting took place, and Sunday was a day of rest. On that day everything was quiet and in repose; even the mighty deep bowed in reverence to a holy influence and was still. The tolling of the bells at Helsingfors was distinctly to be heard; the dull and plaintive sounds, mingled with the strains of sacred music from our men-of-war, came floating over the calm waters, and offered a strange but soothing contrast to the noise, turmoil, and excitement of the two preceding days. </p>
         <p>On Monday morning, the 13th instant, the two fleets got under way and returned the same day to Nargen, having performed in an incredibly short space of time, with comparatively no loss, one of the most  wonderful exploits recorded in modern times.”</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">12 May. </hi>
               </p>
         <p>I proceed to give a few more extracts from the same Paper, “from another correspondent,” also an eye-witness, who seems to write more fully, giving several further interesting particulars. </p>
         <p>“Aug. 8th. French at work at their battery all night, and will complete it, we hope, by to-morrow. The weather could not be better for us; not a ripple on the water. This morning the Imperial flag was flying at Sweaborg, from which we infer that the Emperor, or the Grand Duke, have come to have a look at us. Thousands of people crowd the rocks and heights along the shore, to watch us all day long, and the harbor is perfectly alive with boats carrying troops to different island batteries. At 9.30 p.m. a general signal was made,— “Have steam up by 3 a.m.” </p>
         <p>9th. A glorious morning, and all hearts beating quick with anticipation of to-day’s work. 7.30 a.m. Signal made, “Mortar vessels open fire with shell.” The bombardment will last 18 hours. 8 a.m.—First shell fired; nine gunboats commenced firing, and the action became general along to the eastward as far as the eye could reach, and to the westward as far as a gun could reach; every rock and garden and house seemed full of guns. </p>
         <p>At 10 a.m. we set fire to Fort Vargon, and at 11.5 the magazine blew up with an awful explosion, and for a few minutes the Russian fire slackened. The enemy’s fire is very good when once they get the range; to prevent their doing this the gunboats kept moving in circles formed by four or five in each, and as each brings the bow gun to bear upon its object it is fired, then, turning as sharply round as possible, the broadside gun is pointed and fired, and they then proceed to complete their circle, while doing which they have time to reload. </p>
         <p>12 Noon (exactly).—A monster explosion took place, which lasted without intermission more than two minutes; it was like a volcano in a state of eruption, vomiting forth lighted shells, roofs of houses, and beams of timber. Following this, in the course of half-an-hour, three other explosions took place, which set fire to the barracks and town in four places.—Up to the time I close this (8 p.m.) I am not aware of a single casualty happening to our whole flotilla. </p>
         <p>About 9.30 p.m. the rocket boats commenced practice, when, it being quite dark, a most magnificent spectacle presented itself. The Citadel, Admiralty house, storehouses, and other public buildings on Vargon were all on fire; a beautiful breeze from the N.E. fanned it into a fierce blaze, and the red flames, rising at least 150 feet high, seemed to riot among the clouds of black smoke and lick them up. At this moment the rockets commenced their fearful rush through the air, like mighty meteors, leaving long streams of fire behind them; and the mortars, which had ceased firing for a while, to allow them to cool, began to boom again, and their shells, mounting high in the air, twinkled like stars, as the revolving shell showed its lighted fuse occasionally. We could trace it on its mission until it fell and exploded, when a bright flash, followed by smoke and a shower of sparks thrown upwards, told the havoc it spread around. The rockets and mortars continued firing until 2.30 a.m. of the 10th. </p>
         <p>At 3.30 a signal was made to the gunboats to go into action again, (they had been withdrawn to take in a fresh supply of ammunition,) and soon after 4 the bombardment was general again. The three-decker which was moored across the entrance to the harbour, with such an imposing look about her, had been removed during the night, and placed behind the town, over which we can just see her masts. We made her old position too hot for her, and it is reported she has been on fire three times. I hear that five of our mortars were disabled yesterday, not by the enemy, but by large holes (some of them big enough to put a hen’s egg in) forming in their chambers. Whether this is from the firing, or from defective casting, or the metal, it is difficult to say. They were partially repaired by Mr Ward, Inspector of Machinery, who poured an alloy of zinc and tin into the holes, and some were afterwards fired 70 rounds before the piece fell out. At 6.15 a.m. another explosion took place on Vargon; our fire continued without intermission, and at 12.30 p.m. we succeeded in setting fire to a part of the dockyard and Swartoe, and at 1.30 to a great number of sheds, reported to contain 100 new gunboats not in use; if so, we are quite certain they are useless now, for not a vestige of them remains. This fire spread itself to the town adjoining, and at one time we could see three long streets in a blaze at once. </p>
         <p>At 2.40 p.m. some French gunboats, wishing to take up a better position, sent a couple of gigs to sound a little to the westward, when the town of Helsingfors opened fire upon them from some batteries close under their beautiful Church. It would be an easy task indeed for us to burn Helsingfors to the ground, but we have spared it, and only attacked their fortress, from a wish not to destroy private property; but when our mercy is treated with such base return, we are almost provoked to turn the heads of our little gunboats in that direction. Yet it is evident they expect us to respect certain places, and avoid firing on certain spots, for on one huge building to the westward of Helsingfors is a piece of canvass stretching from chimney to chimney, with the words “Lunatic Asylum” painted in large black letters upon it, yet within 300 yards of it they have three immense batteries—one immediately under it, and the others on either side; and about half a mile to the east of it several hundred men were engaged building a mortar battery and magazine, and covering the latter with sand. This little transaction caused Admiral Penaud [commanding the French fleet] to observe, that “there was much more honour in burning Sweaborg; but there would be more satisfaction in destroying Helsingfors.” </p>
         <p>Aug. 11.—Our rocket boats went in again last night and fired for about three hours. A boat belonging to the Vulture had two men severely and several others very slightly burnt by one of their own rockets. It seems the stall was not properly screwed into the rocket, so that when it was fired, instead of its going right ahead, it must have fallen from the staff and turning backwards, passed across the boat and burnt the crew; most of the men jumped overboard in time to save themselves. </p>
         <p>12th. The bombardment ceased this morning at 1 a.m., at which time the whole place seemed to be on fire. A little after noon Admiral Penaud visited each French ship, to thank the officers and men for their exertions during the late engagement. He was received wherever he went with three cheers. Admiral Dundas [English] issued a general memorandum with the same object, which was read to the men of each ship by their respective captains. </p>
         <p>With this almost entire destruction of Sweaborg I expect we must be satisfied, and not look for any other great operation in the Baltic this year. But there still remains a great deal that may be done; indeed, a great deal more might have been done at Sweaborg but for the failure of our mortars. The blow, however, which we have so successfully given, and which, I believe, was more successful than was ever anticipated, will be severely felt by Russia. It shakes her confidence in her stone walls, and makes her tremble for every town along her coasts, when she sees that a few small boats, many of them actually old dockyard lighters, after having a gun or mortar put into them, are able to destroy stores, public buildings, and property worth millions, and defended by between 500 and 000 guns, without the slightest accident or casualty, for I have just learnt that <hi rend="italic">neither French nor English have lost a single man</hi>, for those wounded in the Cornwallis wore not engaged upon the fortress, and those wounded in the gun and rocket boats were only, with two exceptions, slight burns from our own rockets. </p>
         <p>13th. At 6 a.m. all the fleet got under weigh from off what remains of Sweaborg, and anchored in Revel roads again at noon. At the time we left the fires in the were still burning.”</p>
         <p>Having made those extracts I will just offer a few plain and brief remarks upon, them, premising, that such will naturally occur to almost every one of your readers. </p>
         <p>1. The strength of those immense granite fortifications,—including their large number of cannon and troops; and yet how very little service they rendered, both in defending the place and in injuring the enemy at sea. </p>
         <p>2. The enormous amount of damage done by the ships and boats, and that in a very short time and from a great distance. </p>
         <p>3. The astonishing fact of not a single casualty caused by the enemy occurring on board of the combined fleets. </p>
         <p>4. The exceedingly good handling of the attacking gunboats and mortar vessels. </p>
         <p>5. The judicious concluding remarks of the second “Correspondent,” as to the value of shore defences against maritime attacks. </p>
         <p>And now I will conclude with a few observations, which I would earnestly recommend to the consideration of my fellow townsmen. </p>
         <p>Before that I went inland, the common talk among us <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the supposed impending war, was to the effect, that we might lookout for a visit from the enemy for the sole purpose of plunder. But this is a mistaken—or only a one-sided—view of the matter; as we may clearly see in the bombardment of Sweaborg, and also in the more recent conduct of the French in Chinese waters. War has ever a two-fold object: 1. the crippling of the foe by destruction of property and life: 2. by loot—in any shape—if possible. One can scarcely imagine a Russian fleet, or even a single ship of war, coming to such an insignificant little-known and out-of-the-way place as Napier for the purpose of plunder, nor, indeed, for that of destruction of property (the place being far too small and remote), unless incited thereto by defiance and threats, by brag and colonial “cheekiness.” I can, however, well imagine such a thing happening in sheer retaliation for low abuse and insolence, as a kind of severe chastisement; for all natures are not alike noble—as the Lion and the Mastiff—especially when aroused. On my seeing repeatedly what was in our Papers about the enemy and our local “defences,”—the low abuse and disparagement of the one, and the great and wonderful things to be effected by means of the other,—I felt (shall I write it?) lowered, humbled, at a loss for my countrymen! All such vapourings might be very good fun for narrow-minded short-sighted Editors to indulge in, over a cigar in their cosy sanctums and arm-chairs; but serving to remind me of the fable of the Frog and the Ox; and of the following refrain in the very old laughable ballad—which some of my compeers in age may recollect:</p>
         <p>“By their language and air, every officer there, <lb/>Was a sort of a Cromwell-protector; <lb/>And to judge by their swagger, and flourish of dagger, <lb/>Each man—an Achilles or Hector.”</p>
         <p>And, in conversation on this subject with a few friends from the town, while in the woods, I said,—If I were the commander of a Russian ship of war in these seas, and knew the English language and had happened to look over some Hawke’s Bay Papers, or knew their contents, and time and Orders would permit; I would just run in near enough to Napier and give them a few shells, by way of punishment for their gasconading; concluding my work with a note— “There, gentlemen, you have brought this on yourselves; that is for your cheek!” If ever such a visitation should really happen here by Russia or by any other superior hostile power, (which, may God forbid!) then remember, sufficient damage could be done to us in a very short time without landing, and without coming near to the shore!— </p>
         <p>Here some one may impatiently exclaim, “What then, Old Man, would you advise us to do? Funk?” And my reply would be, “No, no, not so; be prepared for emergencies; for strong able resistance, even to the death if required, and if such could be advantageously used; but don't invite it.” I know very well the trite and hackneyed saying,— “The way to have peace is to be prepared for war;” and this is also true in many cases, but certainly not in ours here; for do what we could, even to the utmost stretch, we could never be prepared for such a war as that,— —a maritime visitation, <hi rend="italic">Destruction inflicted from a distance</hi>! As well talk of being prepared against an eruption from our burning mountain Tongariro,—or a fall of meteoric stones,—or an earthquake! In all such cases it is well to remember the old adage,—  “Let sleeping dogs lie”: for (to quote again from that old ballad)</p>
         <p>“The fat English Knight said undoubtedly right,— <lb/>That the best part of valor’s<hi rend="italic">discretion</hi>.”</p>
         <p>For, seeing we are isolated, and weak as to “Defences,” let us rather imitate the staunch and serviceable “Friend,”—who, while he would not fight against the opposing ship, yet waited coolly on the deck at the bulwarks for the boarders, and when the first one attempted to board his ship, collared him and pitched him overboard into the sea, with a, “Friend, thou hast no business here!” </p>
         <p>Let our unwelcome foe once land here on our shores, and so give us a tolerably fair chance of meeting him,—then, I trust, our men, especially our crack marksmen and sharpshooters, would give him a proper welcome, which the survivors (if any) should never forget. </p>
         <p>For my own part, I confess I cannot see the probability of good ever resulting to the whole Colony from those loudly talked of “Defences,” which are now being carried out. And were they not counselled and designed by old and eminent professional men (Military Engineers), I should be inclined to laugh at them. Something, to be sure, may be done to be of small service,—as, for instance, against the visitation of a single small ship of war, a privateer, or filibusterer, in such narrow and naturally defended entrances as Wellington Heads, Port Chalmers, and Auckland, to protect their inner harbours, but even this I doubt—that is, their real utility. </p>
         <p>One thing, however, in absolutely certain, and that is, their great <hi rend="italic">Cost</hi>! Cost to make and Cost to keep them up,—a heavy sum total, and one which this young Colony in her present circumstances can very hardly bear. I trust I do not write this in any thing approaching to a mercenary spirit—very far from that; rather is it, because those heavy outlays are unproductive, and (in my estimation) useless, while more extra money than we can well raise is absolutely needed for Education and Public Works of real utility and pressing need. Indeed, I should not care to touch on this matter of Cost at all, were it not that I have good reasons for believing that we have some among us who rejoice in the prospect of heavy Government expenditure,—utterly careless as to where the money is to come from, or how obtained,—whether by increased taxation or by further borrowing,—or any how, or for any purpose, as long as such is profusely and recklessly squandered! This evil spirit, which has hitherto done so much harm to this young, struggling, and growing Colony, is still (I deeply regret to I say) living and strong and active among us.—I am, &amp;c., </p>
