                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—As you have kindly inserted my letter containing a few sentences in defence of Governor Eyre in your paper of this morning, I will, with permission, trouble you again on a similar theme,—only vilely carried to a far greater excess of language. Your paper of the 3rd last, contains a low abusive letter written by some creature at Hastings, who, rightly enough (though unwittingly!) signs himself “<hi rend="italic">Tadpole</hi>”—for this bit of brash I thank him.  Because a tadpole just emerged from the spawn of a frog and living in its proper home, the mud of a marsh or stream, cannot possibly have any elevated ideas, or know much of the world beyond its ken, though it may improve in knowledge on becoming a full grown croaker. Now this dweller in mud,—this “Tadpole” comes out in this way:— “Sir, kindly grant me a line or two on this Evolution question. Haeckel, John Stuart Mill, Huxley, Tyndall, Darwin, and Spencer, leading Evolutionists, were (and are) all<hi rend="italic">infidels.</hi>
               </p>
         <p>At present I will confine my remarks to the late Professor Huxley. I select him for two reasons: (1.) My having brought him so prominmently forward in my last Presidential address to the H.B. Phil. Institute, (1896) particularly showing what he had done for both technical and higher education at Home, in the Empire at large, and throughout our colonies: and (2.) to tell your readers what this “<hi rend="italic">Infidel</hi>” has written and published regarding our Bible and its superior teaching, which, it is hoped, may have the greater weight just now. Huxley says:— “I have always been greatly in favour of secular education, in the sense of education without theology, but I must confess I have been no less seriously perplexed to know by what practical measures the religious feeling, which is the essential basis of conduct, was to be kept up in the present utterly chaotic state of opinion on these matters without the use of the Bible. Take the Bible as a whole; make the severest deductions which our criticism can dictate for shortcomings and positive errors; eliminate, as a sensible lay teacher would do if left to himself, all that is not desirable for children to occupy themselves with, and there still remains in this old literature a vast residuum of moral beauty and grandeur. And then consider the great historical fact that for three centuries this book has been woven into the life of all that is best and noblest in English history; that it has become the national epic of Britain, and is familiar to noble and simple from John o’Groat’s house to Land End; that it is written in the noblest and purest English, and abounds in exquisite beauties of a merely literary form; and, finally, that it forbids the veriest kind who never left his village to be ignorant at the existence of other countries and other civilisations, and of a great past, stretching back to the furthest limits of the greatest nations in the world. By the study of what other book could children be so much humanised, and made to feel that each figure in that vast historical procession fills, like themselves, but a momentary space in the interval between two eternities, and earns the blessings or the curses of all time, according to its efforts to do good and hate evil, even as they also are earning their payment for their work? (“<hi rend="italic">On Science and Education</hi>,” Contemporary Review 1870, <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> 397.) </p>
         <p>Nor is this Professor Huxley’s only testimony to the unique glory of the Scriptures. In another able essay he says:— “It appears to me that if there is anybody more objectionable than the orthodox bibliolater it is the heterodox Philistine who can discover in a literature which in some respccts has no superior, nothing but a subject for scoffing and an occasion for the display of conceited ignorance of the debt be owes to former generations. The Bible has been the Magna Charta of the poor and of the oppressed; down to modern times no State has had a constitution in which the interests of the people are so largely taken into account; in which the duties, so much more than the privileges, of rulers are insisted on, as that drawn up for Israel.... Nowhere is the fundamental truth that the welfare of the State in the long run depends on the welfare of the citizen, so strongly laid down.... I don’t say that even the highest Biblical ideal is exclusive of others or needs no supplement. But I do believe that the human race is not yet, possibly never may be, in a position to dispense with it.” (<hi rend="italic">Essays on Controverted Questions</hi>, pp. 55-58.) </p>
         <p>Had I, myself, been bemired by this tadpole, I should not have written, for my old rule is not to answer anonymous letters; but it is far different when one sees the <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">illustrious</hi> dead, the pride and glory of our race, abused in this coarse offensive way. I am, &amp;c., </p>
