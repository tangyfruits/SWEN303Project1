      <p>No. 4.—<hi rend="smallcaps">A square peg in a round hole.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>The time is close at hand when the electors of the new province of Hawke’s Bay will be called on to build and launch their ship. Whether she is to be a steamer or a sailer, of iron or of oak, does not greatly matter; only, if of iron her rivets must suit; and if of wood her treenails must be round in order to fit their holes—otherwise she will very soon be in Davy Jones’ locker.</p>
      <p>Hawke’s Bay is now a separate Province, and her settlers have now important duties to perform. Duties which cannot fairly be put off, nor thrown aside, nor shirked. Duties which, owing to the peculiar temper and circumstances of the times, can only be faithfully performed by a manly determination to do what is right. In order to this every elector should think well and think deeply. For <hi rend="italic">our</hi> commencement as a new province is very different from that of any of the older provinces of New Zealand. And in no one point more particularly so than in that of the <hi rend="italic">non-election of the Superintendent by the people</hi>. (This is a fact which will appear more clearly by-and-by—seeing that John Bull, all over the world, always buys experience dearly.) Therefore, brother-electors, consider this well, ponder this deeply, before you give your vote to any one who may seek it in order to become a Member of Council. Many a man is fit for the office of Council Member who is <hi rend="italic">not fit</hi> for that of Superintendent. Reflect then, that in voting for the one you are in all probability voting for the other. Look about you: talk a little more among yourselves as to fit men; prepare your stuff for your ship, of which you are the builders, but the men whom you may choose the navigators; so shall you avoid the disgrace and loss which is always sure sooner or later to arise from putting a square peg into a round hole. </p>
      <p>For this very reason also, of the Members of Council choosing from among themselves a Superintendent, you will have persons seeking to become Council Members with no other yiew than that of gaining the superintendency—<hi rend="italic">the title and the salary</hi>: just like old staunch wrestlers in a ring throwing young and inexperienced ones in their way to the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> prize. And from this consequence arises, I fear, another equally certain, namely, that you are likely to have more unfit ill-adapted persons seeking to become Council Members, than any of the older provinces have yet had at any one general election. Now, do consider this. Be wide-awake. Recollect the thousand and one failures and sad errors which were said to have taken place during the late Crimean war, and which were mainly charged to the account of <hi rend="italic">red-tapism</hi>—or, <hi rend="italic">the square peg in the round hole</hi>. But those errors, many and grave though they were, were as nothing (<hi rend="italic">to us, here</hi>,) when compared to the evils which will assuredly follow your doing the same thing. Therefore, I venture plainly and openly to advise you:—vote not for any man <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he is rich,—or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he is a good scholar,—or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he may hold, or have held, any government or other office however high,—or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he is the thirty-third cousin of some lord, or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he is a clever chap, or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> “he is a jolly good fellow,”—or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> your wives are exceedingly intimate,—or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he belongs to and will uphold “through thick and thin” your particular class,—or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> in voting for him you will have his custom or influence or favor,—or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he has “the gift of the gab,”—or <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he is of the same family or town or country as yourself,—or, in short, because of any thing less than this—<hi rend="italic">that he is really and truly a fit and proper person to serve the public cause</hi>. Believe me, brother-electors, a plain man of honest heart and practical ability is much more likely to serve your purpose and the welfare of the province, than any assuming upstart with no more brains than a hen be he who he may. As a late writer truly says:— “There is an immense amount of cool impudence nowadays, that puts on the garb of most innocent respectability, and that pushes incompetence into the post of genius, and prefers any quality to the one required if the possessor be well-connected. All see that this tampering with right is almost as fatal to the commonwealth as the most direct dishonesty. And then, when a great misfortune has happened, we have always the consolation of knowing that it is traceable only to the most unexceptionable of dunderheads and imposters; but, the blunder is there,—the evil is done.”</p>
      <p>Believing, as I do, that our welfare and going ahead as a province will mainly depend upon our having a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> superintendent—an honest practical business-like man of comprehensive mind; one who has few or no private interests, nor “hobbies,” but a man of integrity who holds equally dear the interests of all;—believing this, I, after long consideration, thus write to put you on your guard. And this I the more readily do, from my also believing with Adam Smith,— “The just man, the man who, in all private transactions would be the most beloved and the most esteemed, in those public transactions is too often regarded as a fool and an idiot, who does not understand his business.”* Forewarned, forearmed: if you will use white pine instead of totara as piles for your building—if you will put incompetent persons into office—the square peg into a round hole—you must also be content to reap the consequences.</p>
