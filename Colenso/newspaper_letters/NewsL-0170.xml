         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In the vivacious and amusing narration, entitled,— “Up the Kaweka with a mustering Party,” lately given to your readers in three numbers of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi>, mention is made of some of the peculiar and striking plants of that elevated region, especially of one termed the “Wild Irishman.” And as with this plant you have prominently coupled my name, I may be permitted to add to your remarks about it; seeing, also, that the said strange mountain plant is so very little known among us. </p>
         <p>My first practical and experimental experience of this plant took place nearly 60 years ago (in the autumn of 1845), on the high summits of the Ruahine mountains, when I attempted to cross the range on my way to visit the Maoris living isolated at Patea; and in my writing a semi-scientific account of that journey (with special regard to the botany of that region then unknown), I have thus recorded my introduction to and acquaintance with this plant—a species of <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla—</hi>styled by you the “Wild Irishman”;—but of its names more anon. </p>
         <p>Of all the peculiar and novel plants which grew on the mountain tops, the large new species of <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla</hi> was the one which we were all the more likely to remember,—not only for a few weeks but for all time! It gave us an immense deal of unpleasantness, trouble, and pain,—often wounding as to the drawing of blood. I suppose, that each one of the party (six Maoris besides myself), speaking quite within probability, received at least 50 stabs from these plants, which my Maori companions, (in shoulder mats without boots or trousers) justly termed <hi rend="italic">infernal</hi>! I will attempt to describe it. Imagine a living circle of 5 feet diameter (the size of the full-grown plant), with all its many harsh spiny ray-like leaves radiating alike outwardly from the crown of its carrot-shaped root, forming almost a plane of living elastic spears, composed of sharp and stiff points or flat spikes, each several inches long; these make up the leaf, and many of them are set on each long leaf stalk of nearly 2 feet in length: from the centre rises the strong flowering stem, an erect orange-coloured spike or stalk 5 or 6 feet high, containing many hundreds of small flowers, gummy (or having a varnished appearance) and strong-scented, each a little cluster securely guarded with similar miniature sharp spiny bracts or leaflets. The general appearance of these plants, at times, reminded me of a lot of shallow umbrellas opened and fixed upside down on the ground. Of course there were hundreds of smaller plants, also forming circles, of all sizes—from 3 inches diameter upwards; while some still younger (seedlings) were just pushing up their needle-like points (not in a circle, but drawn together) through the mossy soil. These larger plants rarely ever intermixed their spear-shaped leaves to any great extent); they seemed as if they had just touched each other, with their living circle of points, and when we should put down our feet as warily as possible on some tolerably clear spot between them, we were often caught on all sides as if in a man-trap, and not infrequently roared pretty loudly from the pain—while our vain attempts to extricate ourselves often increased it. More than once each one of us was so seriously caught as not to be able to move without assistance. </p>
         <p>On one occasion in particular we all (save one—the sufferer) had a hearty laugh over one of these plants:—One of our party, a strong robust Maori, had been pricked or stabbed rather severely by a large <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla</hi>, insomuch that the blood spurted out: at the sight of this be got enraged (a very natural thing for a Maori in those early days,) and throwing off his back-load, and obtaining the long handled axe, which another was carrying, he hastened towards the plant, vowing be would cut it up by the roots! The spear-like leaves, however, spreading out all round it like a circle of fixed bayonets—being longer (including their big leaf stalk) than the helve of the axe and very tough and elastic, quite kept him from doing any harm to the plant, which seemed to mock his impotent rage; so, after gaining a few more pricks from it for his labour, he was obliged, doubly vexed though he was at our looking on and laughing, to give up the unequal combat. This story was too good to be lost, especially to a fighting race like the Maori, and the joke was long kept up after our return, and repeated with additions at the expense of the poor fellow. </p>
         <p>I may here mention, that when I next travelled over the range from Hawke’s Bay, I took two extra Maoris with me specially armed with long-handled axes to clear the way a little, otherwise baggage bearers could never have got over those spots which abounded with <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla</hi>. My bearers, too, having been warned, some by experience on that former occasion and some by hearsay, took with them sundry old cast off clothing and pieces of matting to use as a defensive armour. </p>
         <p>One of those little open summits bore the name of Maunga Taramea (Mount Taramea) from the plant growing so profusely there. Taramea = <hi rend="italic">the rough spiny thing</hi>, being the Maori name of this plant, not unlike in meaning the botanical name of <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla</hi>, = <hi rend="italic">needle-pointed leaf</hi>, given to the genus by Forster, the German botanist who accompanied Cook on his second Voyage to New Zealand. But Forster’s plant, on which he founded the genus, is another species (<hi rend="italic">Aciphylla squarrosa</hi>); it is very much smaller than this one in all its parts, and has fine narrow pale-green lax leaves—though sharp enough! He got it at Dusky Bay in the South Island; I, also, early found it in Palliser Bay and Wairarapa. Wild pigs grubbed up and ate its thick succulent carrot-like root, which is aromatic, and I think edible for man. </p>
         <p>Our Ruahine plant is thus described by Sir J.D. Hooker:—</p>
         <p>“Aciphylla Colensoi, Stem 6 to 9 feet high. Leaves forming a circle 5 to 6 feet diameter of bayonet-like spikes, two feet long, pinnate; leaflets 8 to 10 inches long, half-inch broad, very thick and coriaceous, narrow linear acuminate, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">N. Island</hi>, top of Ruahine mountains, <hi rend="italic">Colenso</hi>. <hi rend="smallcaps">Middle (S) Island,</hi> Nelson mountains, above 2000 feet,<hi rend="italic"> Bidwill, Monro</hi>, &amp;c. Canterbury, ascending to 5500 feet, <hi rend="italic">Raoul, Haast</hi>, &amp;c. Otago, <hi rend="italic">Lindsay</hi>. There are apparently two varieties; both ore called “Spear-grass,” and “Wild Spaniard.” Monro states that it forms a thicket impenetrable to men and horses.”— “<hi rend="italic">Handbook Flora, N.Z</hi>.”, p. 92. </p>
         <p>A description of this plant with a coloured plate is also given by the late Dr. Lauder Lindsay, F.L.S., in his “Contributions to the Botany of New Zealand,”—a copy of this scarce work is in the Library of the Hawke’s Bay Philosophical Institute. </p>
         <p>As stated in the “Narration,” I brought plants of this species from the mountain (with many others), and they did well and flowered in my old garden at Waitangi, until a heavy flood which submerged them and leaving a deep deposit of fine mud killed them all. </p>
         <p>Hooker describes five species of <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla</hi>; and says of tbe plant,— “a very remarkable genus, confined to N.Z., and the Australian Alps.” The Australian 2 to 3 species, however, are small. </p>
         <p>I may also add another curious and interesting item concerning this Ruahine plant <hi rend="italic">Taramea</hi>, as it is little known. I copy from a paper read before our H.B. Philosophical Institute in 1891, (and published in “Transactions N.Z. Institute,” vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">xxiv</hi>,)— “Reminiscences of the ancient Maoris” § <hi rend="smallcaps">vi</hi>. “of their fine smelling sense and taste for perfumes,” and, after mentioning several, I go on to say:— </p>
         <p>“The choicest and the rarest was obtained from the peculiar plant <hi rend="italic">Taramea </hi>(<hi rend="italic">Aciphylla Colensoi</hi>, Hook,) which inhabits the Alpine zone, and which I have only met with near the summit of the Ruahine range, where it is very common and very troublesome to the traveller that way. The gum-resin of this plant was only collected through much labour toil and difficulty, accompanied, too, with certain ceremonial (taboo) observances. An old <hi rend="italic">tohunga</hi>, (skilled man and priest) once informed me, that the <hi rend="italic">Taramea</hi> gum could only be got by very young women—virgins; and by them after certain prayers, charms, &amp;c , duly said by the <hi rend="italic">tohunga</hi>. This prized perfume is quaintly and lovingly extolled in a sweet little nursery song by the Maoris.” (See more concerning it in the place quoted.) </p>
         <p>Although my letter is already long, I must fain say a few words about the names used in the original narration. And, first, of the “ Wild Irishman.” This low uncouth vulgarism has been (unthinkingly) given “down South” to a species of thorn, a close-growing spiny shrub with very small and few leaves and long spines—appropriately named by the old Maoris — <hi rend="italic">Tumatakuru</hi>—Face-smiter, and by the French Botanist, Raoul <hi rend="italic">Discaria</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">toumatou. </hi> I early discovered this plant at Poverty Bay in 1838, and also grew it in my garden at Paihia, Bay of Islands, (as is stated in Hooker’s  “London Journal of Botany,” vol. IV, p.17, 1844,) but Raoul first fully described it with a place in his “<hi rend="italic">Choix de Plantes</hi>,” in 1846, he having found it at Akaroa. In those Southern parts, according to the late Sir Julius von Haast it grows tall— “15 feet high.” In 1838–1842 it was common at Poverty Bay on the flats near the sea, and I have seen it growing scantily in the Hawke’s Bay District, (2.) It appears from Hooker, (who, no doubt, received the information from his Southern scientific correspondents,) that our big <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla</hi> was termed “Spear-Grass,” and “Wild Spaniard” by the settlers in the S. Island; while “Spear-Grass” is a fair enough common English name for the plant (although it is not a grass, and there are several large and sharp true grasses), the latter name of “Wild Spaniard” is another equally objectionable term; surely the Maori name of <hi rend="italic">Taramea</hi>, if not the botanical generic one of <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla</hi>, is far better than either—neater, fitting, and more euphonious. And here I would observe that I am not certain of the “Wild Irishman” of the “Kawekas” being identically the same species as the large <hi rend="italic">Aciphylla</hi> of Ruahine; as, from the description given of it in the narration, it seems to be a smaller plant, and I have seen no specimens; but the difference in size may arise from the ground having been long used as a sheep run, and so the larger plants have perished, or been cleared off, and those seen only young ones. (3.) Of the name of the country visited: that high hill land to the west of Napier is called in the narration “the Kawekas;” and here, as I take it, is another error in etymology which should be abandoned. Kaweka is the old proper name of that mountain district; and if the Maori name is to be retained (as I hope it may be, not only there but in most places), the terminal letter s, not being Maori, and not agreeing (as a kind of English termination) with Maori idiom and rule, should be dropped. — I am, &amp;c, </p>
