         <p>“A Daniel, still say I; a second Daniel!	<lb/>I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.”</p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Did you over perceive a certain indefinable something in the face of a cow, horse, or dog, which instantaneously reminded you of some person you had formerly seen, or of an absent friend?—one, it may be, whom you had not seen or heard from for many years: if not, I have and that more than once. Yet, if you were to ask me to define it I could not—save by the word, expression or cast. Well, on reading the letter of “A Lover of the Bible” in yours of Friday last (already alluded to by me in my letter of the 4th), in which he brings forward so largely Mr M. Arnold, as supporting the reading of the Bible in our public schools,—the words of Shakespeare in his inimitable <hi rend="italic">Merchant of Venice</hi> (which I have given above as a motto) rushed into my mind! and I have, ever since been in a measure haunted by them. I do indeed thank “A Lover” for bringing forward Matthew Arnold<note xml:id="ftn38" place="foot" n="38"> Arnold was, like Colenso, Inspector of Schools—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
                  </note> in this matter; but whether “A Lover” has read Matthew Arnold’s works on the Bible? (such as, <hi rend="italic">“Paul and Protestantism,” “Literature and Dogma,” “God and the Bible,”</hi>) is quite another matter; also, whether “A Lover” would agree with him in what he has written therein I trow not! However, since “A Lover” has brought this witness forward, in support of his views, he cannot reasonably object to my cross-examination of Mr Matthew Arnold, on what he has said concerning the Bible. </p>
         <p>From my being well-acquainted with Matthew Arnold’s works, and in the main highly approving of them, nothing is more certain than this, that he would never approve of <hi rend="italic">such a kind</hi> of Bible reading as this hurried and distasteful one now sought “without note or comment.” And “A Lover” should have known this, at least; for, as it is, his quoting Matthew Arnold seems like sailing under false colours,—or, in other words, making a man’s words to mean the contrary of what he intended. To this remark I would also just add one other word, viz. that I believe “A Lover” and “Biblos” (in your paper) and “Codex” (in your contemporary) to be one and the same person,—or, at all events, all written at one instigation.</p>
         <p>There are two particularly prominent points in the letter of “A Lover” on which I would first say a few words, before I proceed to examine Mr M. Arnold. </p>
         <p>1.The wonderful “kindling of trains of thought and remembrance through Bible names—as, Zion, Tabor, Hermon, and Sharon,—operating on the imagination of the young readers of that Book!” This, to me, is strange; yet not so, either, when I bear in mind the glamour or false glare that for years (or ages) has surrounded them. How? Through ignorance; and through the clergy, generally, keeping it up and delighting to have it so! For too many of them still firmly believe that “Ignorance is the mother of Devotion.”</p>
         <p>I will give an instance or two of that false glamour I have mentioned, which will explain my meaning. About 18 months ago I wrote a series of Papers, which appeared in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Herald</hi>, on the Reasonable and True Keeping of the Sunday; and in doing so I had occasion to mention the puny and insignificant sizes of the petty kingdoms of Israel and of Judah, which, together, formed what has been termed “the Holy Land.” I therein said,— “Those two kingdoms together, were not so large as the small tract of country extending from Napier to Cape Palliser in length, and from the Ruahine mountain ranges to the sea in breadth. While that of Judah alone could be comprised between Napier and Takapau.” And some of the tribal portions, said to have been cut up and allotted by Joshua to the 12 tribes, were not so large as some of our sheep-runs here in Hawke’s Bay held by one man! I had also quoted from the Bible, the number stated to have been slain on <hi rend="italic">one side only</hi> in a single battle between the two kings of those two small states, namely, “500,000 chosen men”! While, as a set-off, the total loss of the Allied army in the great and memorable battle of Waterloo, including British, Germans, Hanoverians, Brunswickers, Prussians, and Belgians, was 4,172 men.” I, also, showed up therein, several other things taken from the Bible, in plain and convincing unmistakeable language. And often, since the publication of the above, have I received letters and notes and verbal thanks, from old and middle-aged, and from young persons too (who dare to think for themselves), for opening their eyes a bit to those plain natural things, which they had never before heard of, or once thought of, in that way, and so removing the glamour from their eyes concerning some of the Bible statements. And such remarks of theirs do not, can not, stop there: I am also asked Why do not the present working paid Ministers do this? Why do they not explain the Bible truthfully? Is it owing to their ignorance, or to their carelessness, or to their dislike to let in light on all such rnatters,—fearing the result?―These questions <hi rend="italic">they</hi> must answer: I can assure them they are asked.</p>
         <p>2. “The Bible being the only contact the scholar had with philosophy and poetry.”—I don’t know what is the state of things in the English schools, but such is not (or, rather, <hi rend="italic">was not</hi>) the case here; much of choice and beautiful and feeling poetry, taken from the works of our best British poets, was commonly read and explained, and committed, too, to memory, in our Provincial schools,—and, I should suppose, is still. But, apart from that, if the Bible were only dryly read in our Public Schools as a daily task “without note or comment;” where would be the poetry of such a performance? One might just as well speak of the sweet sugariness of vinegar! It is another thing and all very well (as we shall see,) for Mr Matthew Arnold (he, too, being the Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford,) thus to write of showing and educing the grand old Hebrew poetry of the Bible in <hi rend="italic">his mode</hi> of reading it and teaching from it with enlarged culture in schools; but here,—in the wretched way proposed! precious little would, or could, ever be seen or known or mentally felt of the poetry of the Bible.</p>
         <p>Mr Matthew Arnold, examined, says:— “An inevitable revolution, of which we all recognise the beginnings and signs, but which has already spread, further than most of us think, is befalling the religion in which we have been brought up. In no country will it be more felt than in England.... There is a time to speak and a time to keep silent. If the present time is a time to speak, there must be a reason why it is so. And there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a reason and it is this. Clergymen and ministers of religion are full of lamentations over what they call the spread of scepticism, and because of the little hold which religion now has on the masses of the people; many of whom are now found rejecting the Bible altogether. Let me quote from the letter of a working-man,—a man, himself, of no common intelligence and temper,—a passage that sets this forth very clearly; ‘Despite the efforts of the churches,’ he says, ‘the speculations of the day are working their way down among the people, many of whom are asking for the <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> and <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> for the things they have been taught to believe. Owing to questions of this kind, and to their lack of culture, a discovery of imperfection and fallibility in the Bible leads to its contemptuous rejection as a great priestly imposture.’... We regret the rejection as much as the clergy and ministers of religion do. With Catholics as well a Protestants this is so. What the religion of the Bible is, how it is to be got at, they may not agree; but that it is the religion of the Bible, for which they contend, they all declare. ‘The Bible,’ says Dr Newman, ‘is the record of the whole revealed faith; so far all parties agree.... And yet, with all this agreement both in words and in things, when we behold the clergy and ministers of religion lament the neglect of religion and aspire to restore it, how must one feel that to restore religion as they understand it, to re-enthrone the Bible, as explained by our current theology, whether learned or popular, is <hi rend="italic">absolutely and forever impossible</hi>!—as impossible as to restore the predominance of the feudal system, or of the belief in witches! Let us admit that the Bible cannot possibly die; but then the churches cannot even conceive the Bible without the <hi rend="italic">gloss</hi> they at present put upon it, and this gloss, as certainly, cannot possibly live. And it is not a gloss which one church or sect puts upon the Bible and another does not; it is the gloss they all put upon it, and call the foundation of belief common to all Christian churches. It is this so called fundamental basis which must go, and it supports all the rest.... Those who ‘ask for the <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> and <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> for the things they have been taught to believe,’ as the people are now doing, will begin at the beginning. They will never consent to admit, as a self-evident truth, the preliminary assumption with which the several churches start. If they are to receive the Bible, we must find for the Bible some other basis than that which the churches assign to it, a truthful basis and not an assumption; and this, again, will govern everything which comes after. This new religion of the Bible the people may receive; the common and repeated statement now current among the churches of the religion of the Bible the people never will receive.... Meanwhile there is now an end to all fear of doing harm by gainsaying the received theology of the churches and sects. For this theology of theirs is itself now a hindrance to the Bible rather than a help; nay, to abandon it, to put some other construction on the Bible than this theology finds, is indispensable, if we would have the Bible reach the people.... The correspondent we have above quoted notices how the lack of <hi rend="italic">culture</hi> disposes the people to conclude at once, from any imperfection or fallibility in the Bible, that it is a priestly imposture. To a large extent, this is the fault not of the people’s want of culture, but of the priests and theologians, who for centuries have kept on assuring the people that perfect and infallible the Bible is.... Our mechanical and materialising theology, with its insane licence of affirmation about God, its insane licence of affirmation about a future state, is really the result of the poverty and weakness of our minds.... To understand that the language of the Bible is fluid, passing, and literary, not rigid, fixed, and scientific, is the first step towards a right understanding of the Bible. But to take this very first step, some experience of how men have thought and expressed themselves, and some flexibility of spirit, are necessary; and this is culture.... Without culture we cannot have this experience; although it is true that even culture itself, without good fortune and tact, will not fully give it. Still our best and only chance of it is through means of culture.... But it is for the Bible itself that this discerning experience, so necessary in all our theological studies, is most needed. And to our popular religion it is especially difficult; because we have been trained to regard the Bible, not as a Book whose parts have varying degrees of value, but as the Jews came at last to regard their Scriptures, as a sort of talisman or charm given down to us out of Heaven, with all its parts of equal value! And yet there was a time when the Jews knew well the vast difference there is between their books, of the Old Testament; there was also a time when Christians knew well the vast difference between the books of the New Testament. This, indeed, is what makes the religious watch-word of the British and Foreign School Society: <hi rend="italic">The Bible, the</hi> whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible! So ingeniously absurd; it is treating the Bible as Mahometans treat the Koran, as if it were a talisman all of one piece, and with all its sentences of equal power.... We have said, and it is important to maintain it, that popular Christianity at present is so wide of the truth, is such a disfigurement of the truth, that it fairly deserves, if it presumes to charge others with atheism, to have that charge retorted upon itself; and future ages will perhaps not scruple to condemn it almost as mercilessly as Polycarp condemned the religion of heathen antiquity. For us, the God of popular religion—of the churches and sects of the day, is a legend, a fairy tale; learned theology has simply taken this fairy-tale and dressed it up!—Clearly it is impossible for us to treat this fairy tale with solemnity, as a real and great object, in the manner which might be most acceptable to its believers. He does well, who, steadily using his own eyes in this manner, and escaping from the barren routine whether of the assailants on the Bible or of its apologists, acquires the serene and imperturbable conviction,—indispensable for all fruitful use of the Bible in future, that in travelling through its reports of miracles he moves in a world, not of solid history, but of illusion, rumor and fairytale. Only, when he has acquired this, let him say to himself that he has by so doing achieved nothing, except to get rid of an insecure reliance which inevitably some day or other would have cost him dear,—of a staff in religion which must sooner or later have pierced his hand.”</p>
         <p>Here “A Lover of the Bible” (who had long been sitting very fidgetty) meekly said, that he should prefer a Nonsuit.</p>
