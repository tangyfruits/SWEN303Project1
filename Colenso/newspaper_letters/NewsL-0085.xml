         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your issue of this morning you have published, in full, the important bylaw No. 19, respecting the future building, &amp;c, in our borough; which by-law in the main is a very good one as far as it goes; but I think the time is fully come when something should also be done by our Corporation to prevent the reckless cutting into the hill-side properties, which has for some time been carrying on here in our midst; and, by their so doing, present such thoughtless or careless cuttings with expensive lawsuits,—very likely save human life, and be a means of increasing their own rates; not to mention the strict preservation of legal boundaries, and the symmetry of some of the principal outlines of our rising town. </p>
         <p>I, myself, have long been a great loser through such careless unprincipled mode of acting; and this, I regret to say, through both public and private parties. The damage that I have suffered (and am still increasingly suffering); along my E. boundary running parallel with Carlyle-street, is plain to all, and many have been the remarks and the enquiries made to me about it,—some, too, by strangers and visitors, who have been astonished at such a state of things being allowed in a civilised community,—super-abounding as we are in law and police!</p>
         <p>And there is a double if not a fourfold hardship in this case; which I may as well (with your permission) bring before the public. 1. I put up the substantial boundary fence between me and my neighbours of <hi rend="italic">puriri</hi> posts and V.D.L. rails; my neighbors, however, one and all (with two solitary exceptions of owners of ¼-acre sections) put off paying their half, or share: and never to this day have paid anything: 2. When I found, through the reckless cutting and undermining of <hi rend="italic">public</hi> men, my fence was in danger, and was being carried down into Carlyle-straet, I made an attempt to stop the mischief; at first, I was told that the work was under the Provincial Engineer, Mr Weber,—on writing to him I was informed, that he had handed it over to the Corporation; I then wrote to the Town Clerk, and was informed that was out of his line, but he would send my letter to the Municipal Engineer, Mr Peppercorne: on this I relied. (I may here observe that I was busy at this time and absent from Napier, going my country rounds as Inspector of Schools.) On my return I found the work of destruction and positive injury to my property, still going on! and more fencing carried down!! I now sought Mr Peppercorne, and was told that he had nothing to do with it, having handed it over to Mr Dunbar, whose party were there at work for the new Railway Station. I sought Mr Dunbar, he was absent; and at last I was told that the contractor (a man from Wellington named Skelly) was the person to whom I must look! He, too was away; at last I saw him, but got little from him save that he was sorry, &amp;c.;—but the mischief was now done! and I have had to stand to the loss of posts and rails, to the repeated loss of land falling away, and to the continued shifting back of the fence from the boundary line, which in some places has now been done 4 times! 3. In due time the Government passed an Act to compensate owners of properties for the portions taken for Railway purposes; when I, finding that an officer had been appointed here to hear of claims and to make awards, and that among others, Mr Johnston of Wellington, had been awarded by him £400 for a sirip of useless watery swamp adjoining Munroe Street, <hi rend="italic">which swamp land had been fillcd in for the Railway with earth and stone taken from my land</hi> (as above);—I applied for some compensation, and got laughed at! 4. And now I find, that carters here among us will still secretly undermine and carry away from the lowermost layer of sand laid bare there, (though, in some instances, kindly warned by the Inspector of Nuisances,)— and that as every heavy rain naturally brings down more and more of the soft earth and soil, to the sections below, owing to their cliffy cuttings, the owners of those sections are unprincipled enough, for the sake of a few pence, to sell the said earth (my land!) to contractors and carters; little thinking of the awkward consequences to themselves! Further, and recently during the late rains, several panels of my fences have been carried down into Milton Road, and into section No. 103, Tennyson Street, Clive Square, (occupied by a man named Davie) with, of course, much of my land. Now in both these instances I had timely warned the parties concerned (Mr Peppercorne for Milton Road, and Mills and Tait, contractors, on part of selves and Davie,) of the dire consequences which must follow; but got little for my pains! And so it has also been in the case of the Napier school hill-side cutting, of which I had timely warned the Education Board, but————? the Napier School Committee however are now doing their best to mend this matter; and so will, no doubt, the Corporation,— but, money might have been saved, for “Prevention is always better than cure.” But what possible redress can I have from men of straw like Davie? Just another Skelly affair over again; only a blacker one as this injury is from an old Napier man and a neighbor! </p>
         <p>Now if there were a by-law respecting this matter of injury to boundary and loss and damage, (seeing there is provision made in the by-law No. 19, you have published this day, concerning dangerous walls and fences, §42,—and, also, another good by-law already passed, providing against privies and cess-pits being made within 3 feet of the boundary fence,) then I could easily have put it in force,— bring the unthinking fellow up, and get him fined right-off, and there would be an end to it with him; while others would take warning. </p>
         <p>I see, by late Auckland papers, that the Native owners of a hotel at Rotorua: (vexed at the decision of the Magistrate), said, they would burn down their house and so end it! but the Inspector of there quickly told them, that if they did so, he would take them into custody. There, in a half-wild place, they <hi rend="italic">could not do with their own</hi> as they liked; while, here, in the very centre of a town, a man <hi rend="italic">may injure his neighbour’s property</hi> and go on quietly day after day doing so, and the police looking-on with folded hands! </p>
         <p>I hope, therefore, our Corporation will see the necessity of speedily passing such a by-law affecting this matter as will be equitable and give relief. I have long quietly borne with the present unfair state of things. Of one thing, however, the public may rest assured,—that, sooner or later, some lives will be lost, through this reckless cutting into soft earth and making and leaving such dangerous cliffs, overhanging inhabited back-premises; innocent women and children will surely be sacrificed, and that without warning! Indeed, as it now is, the danger is so great in some places, through their careless cuttings, that I should not like to reside in the front dwelling-houses;— some night, perhaps, a thrilling cry may be heard! </p>
         <p>My letter is already too long, but I also wished to remark on a sentence in your sub-leader in your paper of this morning upon this said by-law; where you speak of the past severity of volcanic action at Wellington, &amp;c., and of the shocks having been sufficient to level brick buildings. True; but I would tell you, (as I had told the folks at Wellington, in the very days of their great calamity, when I was present), that much of that (their brickwork being thrown down), was owing to the wretchedly bad mortar they had used. As a proof I mentioned my own 3 chimneys at Waitangi, which were large and high and only built by myself, but with good mortar, made of lime which I had also burned, and no stint; those stood all earthquakes; while the few brick chimneys there were at that time at Wairoa and at Poverty Bay were all thrown down. With you, therefore, I agree that we have nothing to fear from brick or concrete walls falling through earthquakes, if good materials are used. — I am, &amp;c., </p>
