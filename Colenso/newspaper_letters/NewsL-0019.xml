      <p>No. 8.— “<hi rend="smallcaps">Cead mille failtha—(A hundred thousand welcomes</hi>). </p>
      <p>Language is the vehicle of thought. Earthquakes happen; continents may become submerged; nations may be enslaved, or change their dormas, but not their national feelings: these are sure indications of a people’s character. Lavater has laid down, that the character of a man may be detected not less clearly in the most trifling gestures—in the ordinary tone of his voice, in the way he takes a pinch of snuff or smokes his pipe, or mends a pen, than in great actions. Allow this and it follows, that such will ever be found the faithfullest signs of national character. What a chapter—interesting and instructive—might be written on the different forms of national greeting! A truly intellectual box of pemmican! Notice a few of the greetings of the East:—the ancient ‘<hi rend="italic">Shalum’</hi> (Peace) of the patriarchal Hebrews; a pastoral people, always more or less at war; the ‘<hi rend="italic">If God will</hi>,’ of the modern fatalist Arab:— ‘<hi rend="italic">Thy visits are as rare as fine days</hi>,’ of the amatory and poetical Turk. ‘<hi rend="italic">How goes the perspiration</hi>?’ is that of Egypt, which stamps a feverish dry climate to the life. ‘<hi rend="italic">Have you eaten</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">your rice? Is your stomach in good order?</hi>’ are the deliciously kind enquiries of the timid trepang, bird’s nest, and chow-chow consumers of China. (Well might a clever modern writer ask— ‘Could such have taken root in Aberdeen or Kentucky?’) Then, step to the West; notice a few of the ‘words that burn’:—the ‘<hi rend="italic">Chaire’</hi> (Rejoice! be glad!) of the ancient Greek, and the ‘<hi rend="italic">Ti-Kaneis’</hi> (what dost thou?) of the modern degenerate cheating and chattering one;—note the contrast. The primitive Romans (with whom virtue signified manliness, and a man’s whole value was in the measure of his valor,) said, ‘<hi rend="italic">Salve</hi>!’ Vale! (be healthy! be strong!)—how widely different from that of the modern priest-ridden Italian! The Spaniard says, ‘<hi rend="italic">May you live a thousand years!</hi>’; the Frenchman <hi rend="italic">Comment vous portez-vous</hi>? (how do you carry yourself?). Now a real Englishman would never be able to conquer his innate dread of humbug and flummery so far as to use the hyperbolical phrase of the Spaniard, or the superficial gingerbread and fillagree sentence of the Frenchman. Even the kindly <hi rend="italic">‘Hoo’s a’ wi’ ye’</hi> of the canny Scot, carries a spice of national <hi rend="italic">pawkiness</hi> in it. And the Irish motto at the head of this tract, with their ‘<hi rend="italic">Long life to your honour—may you make your bed in glory!</hi>’ plainly shews the violent enthusiasm of the inborn Irish character, the very soul of a people endowed with peculiar lively feelings. (How I love a true Irishman! Give me an open honest Englishman, a sturdy liberal Scot, and a loving faithful Irishman, and I’d back my trio of worthies against all the world.) And then we must not forget those of the land we live in,—the hearty and open New Zealand ‘<hi rend="italic">Haere mai,</hi>’ and ‘<hi rend="italic">Nau mai</hi>’ and ‘<hi rend="italic">Ho mai koutou</hi>’—meaning, come hither,—all thyself and thine welcome hither, and, bring yourselves hither and have no care as to board and lodging. All, however, both east and west, must give way to the real true honest blunt sound and hearty and no-mistake salutation of John Bull— ‘<hi rend="italic">How are you?</hi>’ and ‘<hi rend="italic">How do you do</hi>?’ Here is both theory and practice. To be! to do! Why, these are everything, the whole contexture of life. What a text to write on!—as a modern genius says, ‘<hi rend="italic">How are we</hi>?’ Happy if the advance of knowledge in the 29th or 30th century (to come) shall enable its Brougham or Whewell to answer, ‘<hi rend="italic">Pretty well, I thank you.</hi>’ But anon. </p>
      <p>Now, I confess, I have been lured aside from that which I had purposed when I commenced this tract—namely, to write on what I conceive would strike a chord in the heart of all real settlers, and at the same time (if followed out,) confer a lasting benefit on both our adopted country, and our honoured Father-land. All real settlers heartily wish the province as a whole to go ahead; all such, possessing pluck are determined that it shall. What is really wanted in order thereto, is POPULATION. We do not want money or live stock, or a line of steamers or an electric telegraph. Already we have the elements of wealth in profusion around us; all we want is population. If the offer were now made me, of either a gift of £500,000 for the province, or 2000 good immigrants, I should immediately and joyfully choose the latter. Let this be the first aim of our new government when settled, to do their best towards securing immigration. Let, also, the real settlers do their part, so that the immigrant (on his arrival) may both read in our honest countenances as well as hear from our truthful lips— ‘<hi rend="italic">Cead mille failtha</hi>’—a 100,000 welcomes! I want for my countrymen to have something better before them (on their landing), than to work on the roads, or to wait till sheep-shearing to get a job in shearing the sheep or packing the wool of the few fortunate first comers. This may very easily be managed by ‘one and all’<note xml:id="ftn10" place="foot" n="10"> “one and all” = Durdatha whye! the Cornish motto—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
      </note> uniting in the work. 1st. By the government—setting apart (as acquired from the native owners) more or less of the whole of the Ahuriri plains for agricultural purposes and real occupants;—by the government granting land to agriculturists (where needed) on deferred payments, and also rations (if required) for the first year, or even longer:—2nd. By the settler already <hi rend="italic">comfortably</hi> settled knowing when he has enough, and so ceasing to buy up every morsel of land which the government, may have or offer for sale. Or, if it be said, (as it has been said,) ‘If I don’t buy another will,’ then let the rich (really or prospectively) among us put their heads together for the real benefit of the province and their poorer fellow-countrymen. For which purpose some such plan as this might be adopted: let a club, or society, be formed for the purpose of purchasing desirably situated agricultural land from the government: let a suitable sum be subscribed for this purpose, each giving according to his ability—according to that with which God hath blessed him—(not in driblets of £2 and £5, as have been done for the service of the God of their fathers (!) but in £50 and £100 and £200—and some of the more fortunate among us can very well afford this): let such land be sold to fit agricultural immigrants—to be <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> occupiers—at cost price including charges: let, I say, these things (or something like them) be done by us in a kindly brotherly Christianly real-British, way; and let them be once made known in England through the press, and we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing the many elements of wealth in our province at present lying dormant and wasting, put to their proper and legitimate uses by a cheerful and happy and steadily increasing population. For it must not be forgotten, that while, on the one hand, there are thousands of our fellow-countrymen at home who are bent on emigrating; there are also, on the other, many colonies both old and new bent on inviting them to their respective shores. And, further, it should not be forgotten, that were we to have a large increase of able working-class immigrants to-morrow, such would scarcely remain; or, if remain, not happily and contentedly—seeing that such barriers existed between them and the first-comers. Let us all consider this—especially the rich among us—and acting rightly towards our poorer brother, invite him and receive him with open countenance and a hearty greeting of ‘<hi rend="italic">Haere mai</hi>’— ‘<hi rend="italic">Cead mille failtha</hi>’—a 100,000 welcomes! </p>

      <p>Waitangi, Dec. 13, 1858.<note xml:id="ftn11" place="foot" n="11"> This piece brought a response from six Colenso supporters: “...we, the undersigned, believing at the same time that a section of the settlers of this district, whom your correspondent calls ‘respectable,’ are arrayed against him,—consider it our duty, as honest working men, to inform you that we are highly pleased with the articles that have appeared from the pen of Mr. Colenso, and, moreover, consider that the political information contained in them is far above any thing that has appeared from any other writer. It appears to us that Mr. Colenso exposes truth in colours too vivid to please those who are opposed to him; if there are parties who take insult and offence at the manner in which Mr. Colenso exposes ‘self-seeking politicians,’ it would appear that their own consciences condemn them....” (<hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> 8 January 1859) —<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
