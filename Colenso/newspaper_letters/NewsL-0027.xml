        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—You have already more than once called the attention of your readers to the “Native King movement.” There is a branch, or rather, perhaps, the very stem and support, of the same now actively working among us; which is highly antagonistic to the advance and prosperity of the Province and of its Settlers; and which every Settler should be made acquainted with, and should lend his aid to expose and bring to nought, of course I mean the <hi rend="italic">Runanga</hi>—Native Parliament, “Wittenagemote,” Council, or Inquisition. This Confederated Society or Association is now in “full-swing” among the Natives of this District; and, flushed with success, having succeeded so well among them, it is now seeking not only to oppose the Settlers’ good; but also the Government both Provincial and General. I have very good reasons for believing this <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> to have vastly more powers here (over the Natives) than in Waikato whence it originated and emanated; and I am apprehensive (and sorry indeed to have to pen it) that it has lately received strength through the unwary acting of some Europeans. During Mr. McLean’s late sojourn among us I had the opportunity of more than once conversing with that officer on the subject of the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>, and our views of it (I am happy to say) agree: Lands, that Mr. McLean had purchased from the rightful owners and paid for, are now sought by the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> to be restored— the purchase-money being brought back by the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>, while the unpurchased Lands of the District are entrammelled by the written promises of many of the Proprietors to the Native King, to whom they have been made over, with the avowed determination never to sell a portion of them to Europeans. Roads, (both Te Aute and Middle,) on which some thousands of pounds have been spent, are sought to be immediately stopped. And Cattle to be restrained from grazing on wild open Native Lands. While the Natives themselves (especially the middling and lower classes) are most unmercifully dealt with; their own chiefs being powerless to help them— either through having consented to, or joined, the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>, or their being afraid of it! Now the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>, Sir, obtains this immense power, because, being of native origin and not unrelated to the <hi rend="italic">tapu</hi> (‘taboo’), it quite falls in with the native genius; and it is the more effectual from its working (<hi rend="italic">sub dio</hi>) <hi rend="italic">i te aroaro o te tokomaha</hi> (open and in the presence of all), quickly energetically powerfully and authoritatively for the public (Native) good!! and this under the guise of seeming good—yea, of religious good—the most detestable of all disguises. Inquisition-like it meddles with every thing: it will neither allow its decisions to be reconsidered nor delayed. And if the question is asked (by a white,) why such and such is done, he is curtly answered with “It is the will of the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>;” (“<hi rend="italic">Le Roy le veult!</hi>”)<hi rend="italic"> </hi>or, “It is for good”!! However heavy their money fines may be, they are immediately paid, or rather taken by the officers of the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> in the shape of Horses and other property. Two young Chiefs, Te Kuru and Wi, sold to Mr. McLean in July last some land at Porangahau (which they clearly inherited from their ancestors); Te Kuru was paid £130 and Wi £300. Very recently the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> has been to Porangahau, and this money (though in great measure spent) was there collected and offered to Mr. McLean, who most properly and justly refused it. Now the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> has brought it to Napier to the Provincial Government, and finding the Provincial Government will have nothing to do with it, will still (they say) seek to return it to the General Government at Auckland! The “Queen” (Hineipaketia) and the Chief Hori Niania also publicly sold some of their Land to Mr. McLean for £300.—this also is sought to be set aside by the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>. I could give you, Sir, a great many cases, large and small, in which the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> has promptly and mischievously acted, were such necessary, or had you room. </p>
        <p>On Saturday last the Superintendent met the Chiefs Te Moananui, Paraone, and Karaitiana at Napier, (according to arrangement made with them by letter,) to talk over and agree about the carrying the Middle Road over the open and wild Native land between Ngawhakatatara and Patangata; and so save the twice crossing the dangerous Tukituki river within the short distance of 3 miles, as well as the heavy travelling in its shingly bed.—A matter by which the Natives themselves living on or near the line of road would be equally benefitted with the whites. (His Honor, I should have premised, had, last week, endeavoured by letter, &amp;c., to get them to meet him at Ngawhakatatara, but was hindered through the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>. At that place, however, he saw the Chief Paratene, who resides there, and who readily acquiesced to the road passing over his portion of the Land.) Well: those chiefs, part proprietors of that tract of land, came attended by the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>, and the Waikato Native Minister plenipotentiary of the Native King. The “talk” lasted from noon till sunset; during which the Chiefs were patiently heard, and all their many reasons and arguments adduced were met and answered—I think, I may safely say, fully; but, like as it is with us—</p>
        <p>“The man convinced against his will  <lb/>Is of the same opinion still”—</p>
        <p>so with them: for as fast as they were driven from each and every position they always managed to fall back into the impregnable solid square of the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>; against which neither the dash of cavalry, nor the modern sword-bayonet, nor even Sir W. Armstrong’s steel gun would (I fear) have any effect! His Honor was pleased to ask me to help him on the occasion, as Interpreter, &amp;c,—and at last, on seeing to what a height of imprudent folly they had arrived, I could not refrain from quietly warning them (as an old friend, and as a Member of the Provincial Council,) that, inasmuch as they had sold their back lands to men like themselves and not to winged birds, and had kept the frontages over which roads to the interior must be had, that the time would both surely and quickly come when their consent to roads bridges and public improvements would neither be asked nor required. </p>
        <p>One point however was gained, yet not without difficulty—the Wahaparata bridge was at length, but not till we were about to part, yielded. And yet their objection to that bridge (for the making of which the Public Contract has long been signed and the materials on the ground) we were wholly unprepared for.— </p>
        <p>But what, Mr. Editor, grieves me—more, than even the unthinking and vexatious conduct of the Natives—is, the unwary conduct of certain whites, to which I have above alluded.—Now Mr. McLean fully agreed with me, that the better way to dispossess the Native mind and so to overcome the runanga, was by wholly and always ignoring it, and never in the slightest possible way to acknowledge it; and I am happy to find that that officer constantly did so while at Porangahau, though at no small inconvenience hinderance and expense. I have been credibly informed, that at a meeting of the runanga held a fortnight back at Te Waipukurau, to hear (among other matters) charges preferred against Matthew Meke an old Native Teacher there, (which however he denied, but which were said by the runanga to be proved, and the poor creature fined £100!) a Settler present strongly urged Matthew “to confess to the runanga.” Of course the shrewd runanga sees its authority seemingly acknowledged by a European,—and perhaps, by a man who should have said (if he cared to say anything),— “Matthew, do not heed this unlawful tribunal; pay no attention to it.” Further: Matthew having no money wherewith to pay, the runanga took his horses; and I have been also credibly informed, that another Settler (from Te Aute district,) said, “If Matthew confesses I will arrange with the runanga about the horses”: here (supposing it to be true) is another most unwise strengthening of this mischief-making runanga. Again, I have been informed, that a Settler at Waipureku who had had a trifling article stolen, and who had found it in the possession of a native living near, had after making some stir about it received the article back (or a pecuniary recompense) through the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>: this also (if true) is certainly a most inconsiderate mode of acting. And I greatly fear, Sir, that through some of our fellow-settlers thus continuing to act―in order to get debts paid, or stolen or missing articles found and returned, the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> will point to its use to and support from Europeans, and vaunt of its working for <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, and so become firmly established, only eventually the better to annoy the real good and prosperity of the Province. </p>
        <p>Another statement, which, I am sure, both grieved and vexed the Superintendent on Saturday, was made by the Chief Karaitiana—viz. that one great reason why they were so much against the roads being formed was, that they had been repeatedly told by several whites, that the completion of such roads would be their own sure enthralment and ruin,—and much more to that effect. Now is it not almost beyond belief, that such insanely speaking whites should be found among us? Is any language strong enough to condemn, or any punishment too heavy to be inflicted for such atrocious conduct? Who can tell what the ultimate consequences of the unthinkingly casting about of such sparks may be? I well remember, Sir, the consequences of similar conduct in the very commencement of the Native war at Wellington in March 1846, and which took place while I was staying in that town: Sir G. Grey, with the kindest intentions, suddenly left Wellington one morning in the government steamer for Porirua, to see the Chief Te Rauparaha; had his Excellency then seen him, I have little doubt but that war might have been prevented. Be this as it may, while the steamer was going out of the harbour some low thoughtless whites told the Natives living at Kaiwharawhara— “Ah! Governor gone to make-a-tye, and hang-up Rauparaha!” In a twinkling sundry Natives were on horseback racing against time to Porirua, and reached there just before the steamer, and quite in time to get Rauparaha to run to the woods, and so utterly to frustrate all the Governor’s good intentions. </p>
        <p>I may further be allowed to state, that I have told the Natives, (in their highly figurative way,) that the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> has no foundation—is a thing of yesterday—a mushroom without either ancestry or legs:—that there can not be but three sources of authority, to (or among) them—viz, 1. the Queen, and through Her Majesty all lawfully constituted secular authorities: 2. the Church in Ecclesiastical matters: 3. the principal Chief of each tribe in certain matters affecting his own tribe:—and as the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> clearly comes from none of them, and is not supported by them, it cannot have any proper authority. Now the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi> wishes to establish itself on Church or Religious authority; in fact it asserts as much! And I cannot help thinking, that it is a cause of regret that those who possess official authority in the church, or churches, do not act more energetically and decidedly in this matter; as by their so doing they would effectually cut the very sinews of the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>, and thus its hold on the minds of the many would be for ever weakened if not destroyed. </p>
        <p>In conclusion I would add, (and I hope that I shall be believed to have a little insight into Native matters, as well as to have the welfare of the Province at heart,) that I would highly recommend to all a firm and temperate mode of acting with reference to the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>: never allow of its authority in any degree or share: no, not even if by so doing a person might gain much thereby.—It may be some one may have lost his horse—or may need Native workmen—or cannot be paid money justly due without applying to the <hi rend="italic">runanga</hi>: still, be patient; never look to it for aid; never allow of its proceedings. And, whenever it is spoken of, speak of it (if you notice it at all—for often <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> will be found to be the best,) in quiet calm language, as a mere passing shadow—a wind—a whim of the day. </p>
        <p>             I am, Sir, Yours very truly,</p>
        <p>
