      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your last paper, of the 31st ult., I notice your stating, that “the news of the week, notwithstanding the number of arrivals, is not of much importance”; I, therefore, think the present lack of important matter to be a good time for me to fulfil a promise made to you some time back, and kindly published by you in your 37th number. I now essay to inform your many readers, as to the best sorts or varieties of <hi rend="italic">Apple Trees</hi> suitable for cultivation among us. </p>
      <p>And here, at the very beginning, I am, as it were, launching into both a broad and little known sea. For, not to mention the prodigious number of well-known and established varieties, my ignorance of what really good sorts are at present obtainable at Auckland and Wellington, Nelson and Canterbury, should almost deter me from writing on this head. Notwithstanding, I shall do my best, in telling what I know experimentally; and, also, in stating what has been said on this subject by others well qualified to do so. </p>
      <p>Upwards of 20 years ago the Horticultural Society of London published a catalogue of Apples and Pears: which was, (and, perhaps, is) the only one to be depended on for accuracy; and is such a catalogue as none but a public body could bring to such perfection. In it they give, the <hi rend="italic">color, form, size, use, quality</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">season</hi> of each variety. Of <hi rend="smallcaps">apples</hi>, their catalogue contained 1396, and of <hi rend="smallcaps">pears</hi>, 677 named varieties, <hi rend="italic">exclusive</hi> of synonyms. And when it is considered, how very much the science of horticulture has increased since that period, it is, perhaps, rather under than over, to state, that the varieties of apples and pears at present known exceed 3000! </p>
      <p>As I am professedly writing for the information of those, who, in settling in a new country, have plenty to do, and, consequently, not much time to spare for the purpose of study; and as I wish that what I write should be of service to all; I shall, in writing of sorts, speak of them as <hi rend="italic">summer</hi>, or, as <hi rend="italic">winter</hi> fruit, and as suited for <hi rend="italic">kitchen, table</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">cyder</hi> purposes. </p>
      <p>Of <hi rend="italic">summer</hi> apples (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. fruit quite ripe and in perfection before March,) I have in my garden here, 5 old, 1 improved, and 2 new varieties. The 5 old ones are, <hi rend="italic">Devonshire </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Red Quarrenden, March Aromatic, Nonesuch, Hawthornden,</hi> and one (a yellow apple) name unknown; the improved variety, is a <hi rend="italic">Nonesuch</hi> scion grafted on another apple stock, by which the apple is greatly altered and improved: the two new varieties are, the one a small sweet very early apple and a great bearer, which I have named <hi rend="italic">New-Year</hi>, and the other a very elegant and juicy apple having a peculiar transparent centre, which I have not yet named.* Of these 8 varieties, the <hi rend="italic">Hawthornden</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Nonesuch</hi> have long been well known as excellent kitchen fruit; forming, in cooking, one uniform mass of rich pulp; while the <hi rend="italic">Quarrenden</hi>, <hi rend="italic">March Aromatic</hi>, improved <hi rend="italic">Nonesuch</hi>, and new apple with transparent heart, are all very good as table fruit. Some also like the <hi rend="italic">Nonesuch</hi> as a dessert apple, and some (particularly childreu) praise the sweet <hi rend="italic">New-Year</hi>. Of those here mentioned, I can confidently recommend the <hi rend="italic">Hawthornden, March Aromatic, Nonesuch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crystal-Heart</hi>, as very suitable summer fruits for settlers; and where there are children (or a “sweet tooth,” or a kind host,) a <hi rend="italic">New-Year</hi> should not be forgotten; as it not only ripens earlier than any other, but it will be both acceptable and often visited in the Christmas holidays—if not remembered and talked of for some time after. </p>
      <p>Of <hi rend="italic">winter</hi> apples (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> fruit which ripen late, keep well and improve by keeping,) I have also in my garden 15 varieties:—viz. 8 old, 1 improved, and 6 new. The 8 old sorts comprise—<hi rend="italic">Ribstone Pippin, Royal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Autumn Pearmain, Court of Wick, Margil, Dutch Mignonne, Codlin, Yellow Pippin</hi>, and a greenish yellow apple, name unknown: the improved sort is a scion from the <hi rend="italic">Court of Wick </hi>grafted on another apple stock, by which the fruit is large and handsome: the new varieties are, <hi rend="italic">Waitangi, Napier, Settler, Bonum, Keepsake</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Phoenix</hi>. Of the old and wellknown sorts, I should particularly recommend to settlers the <hi rend="italic">Ribstone Pippin, Court of Wick, Margil, Dutch Mignonne, Codlin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Yellow Pippin</hi>; and of the new kinds, the <hi rend="italic">Napier, Bonum</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Keepsake</hi>, of which, the <hi rend="italic">R. Pippin, Court of Wick, Margil, Y. Pippin, Napier,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bonum</hi> are table fruit. My <hi rend="italic">new</hi> winter varieties are certainly not so estimable for the dessert as the old kinds, but they are handsome and of first-rate quality for the kitchen, and are better adapted for keeping, remaining sound and firm until October; the <hi rend="italic">Keepsake</hi>, in particular, (one of the very best of all my new kinds,) a large and excellent kitchen fruit, I have kept sound, in the common way without packing, until the middle of November. </p>
      <p>So much, Mr. Editor, for the kinds of apples that I both practically and experimentally know. I shall now give, from the catalogue of the London Horticultural Society, a selection of the best sorts, some of which may perhaps be obtained in New Zealand, or in the neighbouring colony of Tasmania. But here I would offer another cautionary remark—not to depend too much on the mere <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of an apple. For I find, in referring to the aforesaid catalogue, that there are several apples of widely differing qualities bearing one name! For instance of the old kinds already mentioned, there were (20 years ago), 4 Quarrendens, 4 Hawthorndens, 8 Nonesuchs, 2 Court of Wicks, 2 Royal Pearmains, 17 Codlins, and 2 Ribstone Pippins; while of some other good sorts (whose fruit we have formerly eaten, and whose names we recollect with a sigh,) there were still greater numbers both good and bad of each kind, all bearing, through the carelessness, or ignorance or knavery of the cultivator, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> name:—<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> 28 kinds of Nonpareil, 18 of Golden Pippin, 7 of Newtown Pippin, 9 of Belle-fleur,§ 11 of Queenings, 10 of Redstreaks, 8 Incomparables, 6 Gilliflowers, and of Russet and Pearmain of each a host! And when the amount and height of impudent adulterations of the last 20 years are considered (that our <hi rend="italic">imported</hi> food and drink and clothing and medicine are not what they are called and labelled and would be sworn to be (if needed) in a Court of Justice—that our Mustard is not <hi rend="italic">Mustard</hi>, nor our Port <hi rend="italic">Port</hi>, nor our Woollens <hi rend="italic">Wool</hi>—only think of this barefaced attempt ye wool-growers!)—a settler sending abroad for some good old sort of apple by name, and believing that it is sure to bear the like delicious fruits as those he knew once in his fatherland bearing the same name, may after all be disappointed. </p>
