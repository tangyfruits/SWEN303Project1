         <p>“True Faith and Reason are the soul’s two eyes.”	<lb/>  —<hi rend="smallcaps">Quarles</hi>.</p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,— “Tadpole” says, in your paper (quoted fully by me yesterday), that “Huxley, Darwin, and Spencer, leading evolutionists, were (and are) infidels.” Of Huxley I wrote yesterday in my letter No. 1. I would now say a little in defence of Darwin (not, however, that such is really needed). And here I may be permitted to briefly remark, <hi rend="italic">in limine</hi>, that having yesterday in Synod to say a few words respecting my personal knowledge of the late Rev. S.M. Spencer, when we were students together under Bishop Selwyn 55 years ago,—I am now led still farther back to a brief personal acquaintance with Darwin 63 years ago when residing in the Bay of Islands. For it may be that I am the only person living in the colony who had the pleasure and benefit of conversation with Darwin in this land; and possessing his able published works, and holding and supporting the great truths set forth in them, I consider it both a duty and a privilege to have to write for your columns a few imperfect yet well-intended lines in vindication of this great man. Moreover, this particular crisis (when so much had been of late said in your columns respecting evolution, and the Church of England clergy being assembled here in Synod,) seems a most fitting opportunity for my using my pen. And having thus mentioned my brethren of the clergy, and wishing to gain their ear, I think I cannot do better than to quote for their especial benefit from two of our great devout Church-of-England authorities—writers whose works have ever been highly esteemed by us—viz. Hooker, and Bishop Ken. Hooker says:— “That authority of men should prevail with men either against or above Reason is no part of our belief. Companies of learned men, be they never so great and reverend, are to yield unto Reason.” (<hi rend="italic">Eccl. Polity</hi>, Book II. ch. VII, 6.) And dear Bishop Ken, (whose Morning and Evening Hymns are so prized and frequently used in our Church,) quaintly says:—</p>
         <p>Three volumes he assiduously perused, 	<lb/>Which heavenly wisdom and delight infused, 	<lb/>God’s works, his conscience, and the Book inspired.  	  Bishop Ken,<hi rend="italic">Hymenotheo.</hi>
               </p>
         <p>In these pregnant words is food for thought. And, following out my line of thought, I think I cannot do better than quote from a well-known living high authority—the present Dean of Canterbury (England) Dr. Farrar, what he too has again recently published respecting Darwin, in his new work on the Bible; as his words will (rightly) have more weight than anything I could write— </p>
         <p>“Which of us does not remember the burst of scorn and hatred with which the theory of <hi rend="italic">Evolution</hi> was first received? Mr Darwin endured the fury of pulpits and Church Congresses with quiet dignity. Not one angry or contemptuous word escaped him. The high example of patient magnanimity and Christian forbearance was set by <hi rend="italic">him</hi>; the savage denunciations and fierce insolence came from those who should have set a better example. What has happened since then? The hypothesis of Evolution, taken in its whole extent, is still an hypothesis only. Proofs final and decisive are confessedly wanting. On the admission of its supporters links are still missing from the evidence in its favour. Yet before Mr Darwin’s life was over two things had happened. On the one hand his hypothesis had been accepted as a luminous guide to inquiry by the large minority of the leading scientists of Europe and America; and even those who reject its extreme inferences fully admit that it rests on a wide induction and furnishes an explanation for many phenomena. That there is such a law as that of natural selection in the struggle for existence all are now agreed. Further, the theory of Evolution has now been admitted as a possible explanation of the phenomena of life by leading theologians, and we have been told on all sides, that, if it should prove to be true, there is nothing in it which is contrary to the creeds of the Catholic faith. Not a voice was raised in opposition when Mr Darwin was laid with a nation’s approval in his honored grave at Westminster Abbey; and—seeing how noble was his example, how gentle and pure his character, how simple his devotion to truth, how deep his studies, how memorable his discoveries, even apart from the view which is mainly associated with his name—I regarded it as an honour that I was asked to be one of the bearers of his pall; and to preach his funeral sermon in the nave of ‘the great temple of silence and reconciliation.’” </p>
         <p>Further, Dean Farrar says:— “The din and furious battle between science and that which was mistaken for religion has been chiefly waged over the first chapter of Genesis. That chapter is of transcendent value, and in a few lines corrected the Idolatry, the Polytheism, the Atheism, the Pantheism, the Ditheism, the Agnosticism, the Pessimism of millions of mankind. No science has ever collided with, or can ever modify, its true and deep object, which was to set right an erring world in the supremely important knowledge that there was one God and Father of us all, the Creator of heaven and earth, a God who saw all things which He has made, and pronounced them to be very good. It was written to substitute simplicity for monstrous complications, and peace for wild terrors, and hope for blank despair,” </p>
         <p>In all such conflicts a self-styled theology, intruding into regions of which it is profoundly nescient, exhibits nothing but its own impotence and rage. No sight is more disturbing than that of religious teachers who, knowing little of anything, and nothing of science, and not exhibiting the smallest sign of moral elevation over others, but often very much the reverse, assume oracular airs of superiority over the patient students of God’s works. Nothing but rout has ever followed such attempted usurpation, Whatever inferences may have been drawn from the misapplication of the narrative of creation, there is no sane person who now believes that the world was made in six solar days; or that the trees and plants were created before there was any sunlight; or that all the stars were created after the earth was covered with vegetation; or that all the fishes and birds were created previously to all quadrupeds and reptiles; or a multitude of other details which have been inferred from regarding the first chapter of Genesis as a scientific document instead of regarding it as a religious revelation. </p>
         <p>It is now understood by competent inquirers, that geology is God’s revelation to us of one set of truths, and Genesis of quite another. May your numerous readers, Mr Editor, readily and thankfully support Dean Farrar in his noble and truthful eulogism on Darwin; and his fitting remarks on the Mosaic cosmogeny,—I am, &amp;c., </p>
