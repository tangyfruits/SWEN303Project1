         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Much has been said of late respecting this drug; the papers have been repeatedly full of it; but, as far as I have seen, it has only been mentioned with disapproval, almost amounting to horror, as a virulent “poison;” not a word said in its defence, or to show its great use and beneficial service in medicine,—in skilful and cautious hands. </p>
         <p>For some time I have thought of writing a few words to the Press on this subject; if only to remove from the public mind the general impression—of Antimony being only a “poison,” and of very doubtful use in medicine. Of course, this common belief is now strengthened through the modern prohibitory law respecting its sale by Druggists: as well as by the manner it has been of late (for the last two mouths) spoken of in the papers; including the statements of Medical and other professionals in our Law Courts respecting it:—not one word (as far as I can learn) having been said in its lawful defence and support.</p>
         <p>I know very well that in my writing on this subject I shall lay myself open to the charge of being an intruder,—perhaps a quack, or charlatan! but now, as before, <hi rend="italic">I speak only of what I know.</hi>
               </p>
         <p>And here, I think, a sagacious saying of our celebrated Englishman Locke, may not inaptly be adduced:—Were it my business to understand physic, would not the safer way be to consult Nature herself in the history of diseases and their cures, than espouse the principles of the dogmatists, methodists, or chymists?”—</p>
         <p>Now it so happens, that I myself have had pretty much to do with Antimony as medicine in its various preparations during my life; and that not only in prescribing and administering it to others, but in using it myself, and have found very great benefit from it on many occasions. A few of the more prominent cases I will mention.</p>
         <p>When very young (a growing schoolboy) I was long subject to an internal disorder; doctors and their remedies were tried, also the nostrums of old women (never in those days despised in country places), and also some of those other nostrums painfully collected and published by Rev. John Wesley in his book of “Primitive Physic,” (which, at that period, 60–70 years ago, was in high repute, especially in Cornwall )—all, however, proved to be of little if any service. About that time a Danish Doctor (said to be the physician to the King of Denmark) came over to the much warmer climate of Mount’s Bay to spend the winter, on account of his health, he being consumptive, and I soon became one of his patients; and after taking his medicines, undergoing operation, and suffering much (all to no purpose), I left him. At this time I was advancing towards manhood (in my teens!) and I began to study Medicine a little, having the opportunity of so doing;—for I was early intended for the Medical profession, owing to our esteemed family Doctor being one of my godfathers. Among other strong medicines that I prescribed for myself, for my obstinate internal complaint, I may here briefly notice <hi rend="italic">Sulphuric Acid</hi>; and this not merely the diluted article of the Pharmacopæia, but the stronger raw article of commerce,—which, of course, I diluted in my own way, but was always obliged to suck it up through a glass tube, and this did me some real service. After a while, however, I took Antimony, (the very notorious and much-abused Tartarised Antimony, or Emetic Tartar of the present time!) and of this drug I have taken as much a 2 grains, and on occasion 2½ grains, at a dose; and from this medicine I derived very great benefit.</p>
         <p>So much for my early experience. </p>
         <p>In coming to Hawke’s Bay to reside in 1844, I brought with me a large and varied assortment of useful Medicines obtained from Apothecaries Hall. And, as may be readily supposed, I had plenty of <hi rend="italic">gratuitous</hi> practice! (I may here mention that for several years from the year 1835 I was in sole charge of the Church Missionary Surgery at Paihia, in the Bay of Islands; there being at that early period no resident Surgeon in the Bay, or indeed, in all New Zealand.)</p>
         <p>In 1846, the first visitation of Influenza appeared among us here in Hawke’s Bay; and it was a sad time! for the epidemic was very severe and protracted. Now, then, was again seen the great benefits from the judicious use of Antimony (Em. Tartar). I had a large household, including Maori domestics, boys and girls; and my common practice was, during the raging of that Epidemic—first, to weigh out every morning 6 grains of Antimony, and dissolving this in a large bowl of water, to place it on a table in the hall, with a table-spoon and a dessert-spoon by its side; and of this we, all hands (sufferers from influenza) took a spoonful every 3 hours; and this use of it was kept up for several days. I proved this to be exceedingly beneficial in most cases, including my own self and family; in all, I may say, where the seat of the disorder was more especially confined to the chest. And this practice I always carefully followed, in succeeding years in my own house, whenever influenza appeared.</p>
         <p>In cases of Croup I have also found Antimony to be a most beneficial medicine; as well as in certain cases of Indigestion, Bilious Complaints, and severe chronic maladies. Used outwardly as an Ointment I have also proved it to be great service in Hooping Cough, severe swellings, &amp;c.—I believe that the celebrated Dr Jenner was the first to recommend the use of it in this way. For my own part I consider Tartarised Antimony to be the best and most useful of all the Antimonial preparations, because it is so easily managed.</p>
         <p>In all chronic disorders where it is likely to be of service, its use must be continued for a long time. I never heard (until of late) of its administration in minute doses being considered by physicians of eminence as poisonous. When taken in <hi rend="italic">large</hi> doses, of course, it acts as an active corrosive poison; but even then its symptoms are immediately produced and well-known.</p>
         <p>I could say a great deal more on this head, but I forbear. At present I merely give you a little of my own experience.—I am, &amp;c., <note xml:id="ftn50" place="foot" n="50"> It is quite possible that some of Colenso’s symptoms may have resulted from chronic antimonial poisoning, common in printers in those years—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
