                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Your paper of this morning contains a letter signed “Fair Play” in defence of three boys who were brought before the Magistrate yesterday for stealing rails. Had “Fair Play” not wilfully belied his assumed name, perhaps I should not now be writing; for, if “Fair Play” is a parent, or near relation of one of those poor boys I could not have noticed his letter—under the circumstances—feeling as he must for his child; but, if “Fair Play” is nothing of the kind, then, as I have said, he has belied that name,—in assuming it and acting to the contrary,—in abusing our well-known and long-tried Inspector of Police, and also the R.M. (both, too, fathers of families), well knowing that from their official position they could not reply to his charges; and, also, in his more than gross insinuation against our old and valued medical friend Dr Hitchings,—as to his having any claim to the dividing fence of his own freehold! Bah! </p>
         <p>I pity those three unfortunate Boys, particularly the two younger ones (although I do not know them); but I do not pity nor feel in any way for their unhappy parents; indeed, I would that the law could have been put in force against <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, and so let the boys go free on their own simple confession; for the receiver and encourager of theft is generally worse than the thief,—always so in the case of parents. </p>
         <p>For my part I knew nothing of this affair until it was all over; but I heartily thank Dr Hitchings for taking it up, and Mr Inspector Scully for his part in it. With him I hope something will shortly be done in the matter of a proper reformatory—and I trust the Magistrates and Grand Jury will at the next meeting of the Supreme Court in Napier make a very strong presentment to the Judge respecting the urgent necessity of such an institution. </p>
         <p>Curiously enough yesterday, at the very hour of trial (ignorant of what was going on), I was engaged at the Survey Office with Mr Baker, the Chief Government Surveyor, respecting the necessity of early replacing a trig. station block which some boys had dug up and stolen from my paddock just in front of my house; it was of little worth to them (or to their parents) save as a lump of firewood. </p>
         <p>For some time past I have suffered considerably through some persons (believed to be “boys”) breaking down and stealing the rails of my fences—particularly, I may say, of the long dividing fence between my land and that of Dr Hitchings. My late man, James Morgan, was completely tired with so much extra labor consequent on such often-repeated wholesale robbery in fitting and replacing rails. At last I consented to his nailing them into the post-holes, and then they were hacked out and taken away! Those rails were mostly V.D.L. timber, and altogether, including labour, cost me a considerable sum. </p>
         <p>Further, I may mention that I had this land of mine surveyed, roads through it laid off, and cut up into quarter-acre sections, each section being fully pegged with extra large totara pegs, with their numbers burnt in, and well driven into the ground; in a short time all were drawn up out of the ground, and carried off by “boys” for firing, the Government trig block, the biggest of the whole lot, and nearest to my dwelling-house, being left for the last. Perhaps “Fair Play,” (with his wee quantum of legal knowledge, or quibble) may further suppose that the parents of these “boys” did not see, or, seeing, did not know, the burnt and stamped figures and marks on those prepared totara surveyor’s pegs? I venture to state that £50 would not cover the loss to me of those surveyor’s pegs and consequent professional labour, as now that work must be done over again. </p>
         <p>At present I say nothing of the almost continual stealing of garden produce—as fruit, vegetables, and roots, and, also, ducks. For these matters I have complained to the police, and have all but come to the conclusion to give up all attempt at having fruit or vegetables, and so escape the continual annoyance of having them stolen—generally, too, just before they are fit to use.! </p>
         <p>In conclusion, sir, allow me to say, that I feel these things the more when committed by our own European “boys” (and men and women!); from the fact that I have lived more than twenty years among Maoris, and never had anything stolen; and yet the Maoris are looked down upon and talked of, by those European thieves and swindlers, as the inferior race!!—I am sir, &amp;c., </p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr W. Colenso</hi> writes us a letter, too long for publication <hi rend="italic">in extenso</hi>, upon the the case of the convict Habron, concerning whom a paragraph cut from a Home paper appeared in our issue of last Thursday. Habron, it will be remembered, was about two years ago sentenced to death for the murder of a policeman at Manchester, but was reprieved on account of his youth. The infamous Peace, who was recently hung, admitted when in gaol that he killed the policeman. Mr Colenso sends us an extract from the London <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, showing that the authorities, after a close investigation, found indisputable proofs of Habron’s innocence. He has been accordingly liberated, and will receive a sum of money as compensation for the degradation and punishment he has gone through, the money to be invested for his benefit under the supervision of trustees. The same paper has an admirable article upon the danger of finding prisoners guilty on purely circumstantial evidence. No circumstantial evidence could be stronger than was that against Habron, yet he has been proved to be innocent. By the mere accident of youth he escaped hanging. The <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> says:— “The main warning for Justice to derive from this memorable case is to be ever on her guard against circumstantial evidence combined with police prepossession. The ordinary official mind is too much like a bull which, after lowering its horns for a charge, closes its eyes. In this instance, we fear not only that facts were strained against the prisoner, but that evidence was set aside which ought to have told in his favor.... So blindly tenacious of a prepossession are officials, that when even the respite was granted they still stuck to the belief that, if Habron had not actually fired the pistol, he was accessory to the fact, and the re-examination of the case was commenced, it is said, with prejudice still strong against him. Altogether a more suggestive rebuke was never given to human justice. It has inflicted on this honest boy the long bitterness of impending and shameful death; it has wasted 2 years and 8 months of his early manhood in useless and degrading toil; it has killed his father with a broken heart, and stamped the ignoring of crime upon his family; and finally it owes its own deliverance from the perpetration of all these measureless wrongs to a murderer’s volunteered confession. William Habron, therefore, must not be merely provided for and forgotten. His name and story must remain ever present to the mind of the Queen’s Judges and Secretaries of State as long as the law inflicts sentences, which, once executed, can never be reversed.” </p>
         <p>Mr Colenso upon this remarks:— “No evidence is superior to circumstantial evidence when it is perfect, fully clear and complete; but (if) even only <hi rend="italic">one link</hi> of the whole chain is wanting, then it is to be held in doubt and not to he trusted.” </p>
