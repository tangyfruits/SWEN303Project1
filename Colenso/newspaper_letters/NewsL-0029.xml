            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In fulfillment of a promise made in my short address to the Electors ot the Town of Napier in your last week’s issue, I now write. I intend to confine myself strictly to facts; and so deliver “a plain unvarnished tale,” without rhetorical flourish.</p>
         <p>In June, 1859, after some preliminary arrangement, (of which I may just mention two parts, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. that my engagement as Auditor was not to occupy more than half of my time,—and that my aid as Interpreter &amp;c. was to be afforded when I should be in town attending to my duties as Auditor;)—well, in June I accepted (as I take it) the office or offices I have ever since held; as will clearly appear from the following Official letter notifying my appointment;—as well as from the open and well-known fact of my having been from that time so engaged.—</p>
         <p>“Superintendent’s Office,	</p>
         <p> 							Napier, June 15, 1859:</p>
         <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I have the honor to convey to you an official notification of your appointment to the office of Auditor for this Province, at a present salary of £150. per ann., which you will be entitled to draw from the 1st instant; and should you be willing to give me the assistance I may require in transacting with the Natives from time to time, I will recommend the payment to you at the next meeting of Council of a sum not less than £50. per ann. for services you may render me in the management of Native affairs.”</p>
         <p>		(signed) T.H.<hi rend="smallcaps">Fitzgerald</hi>,</p>
         <p>		Superintendent.</p>
         <p>As a neccsary censequence it followed that I lost my seat in the Provincial Council. Therefore, in August last, the Electors of the town of Napier were called on to elect a Member, and they again did me that honor.</p>
         <p>At the late meeting of our Provincial Council, (called together for a few days only to pass the necessary estimates,) my name appeared on the estimates (as laid in manuscript on the Council table) as “<hi rend="italic">Auditor and Interpreter</hi>,” with a proposed increase to my salary of £50. per year (<hi rend="italic">as, indeed, promised by the Superintendent in his letter containing appointment</hi>). This addition was at first opposed by the Members for Waipukurau, but ultimately carried by a large majority.</p>
         <p>I, however, felt so much hurt at the opposition which had been made,—and which I considered most uncalled for, as my <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> attendance on my duties was so notorious,—that I feelingly said, (as reported by you), that “I objected to any increase of salary, although, at the same time, I was not half paid for the work I did.”</p>
         <p>Very soon after I received another Official letter; of which I also give a correct copy.—</p>
         <p> Superintendent’s Office,</p>
         <p>					Napier, Dec. 1, 1859.</p>
         <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I have the honor to inform you, that your Salary has been voted by the Provincicial Council at the rate of £200. per annum, from 1 January 1860.”</p>
         <p>		(signed) (T.H.<hi rend="smallcaps">Fitzgerald</hi>,</p>
         <p>		Superintendent.”</p>
         <p>After a few days consideration I replied to this letter as follows:—</p>
         <p> “Auditor’s Office,</p>
         <p>					Napier, Dec 9, 1859.</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your Honor’s letter of the 1st instant, informing me that my “Salary has been voted by the Provincial Council at the rate of £200 per ann., from 1st January 1860.</p>
         <p>“Before, however, that I proceed to give you, Sir, my thoughts and determination respecting the above,—I feel that I am, in all honourable duty, bound to thank your Honor for placing the proposed increase to my salary on the Estimates, (and so fulfilling your promise made in your letter to me conveying my appointment,) as well as for the kind truthful and firm statement respecting my services made by you in the Provincial Council. </p>
         <p>“As we were both in our seats in the Council (as members for Napier) during the passing of and the discussion on the Estimates for the 1<hi rend="sup ">st</hi> quarter of 1860, I have no occasion to repeat here what was then said by some of the Country Members respecting the proposed addition to my salary; and which (eventually) led me to state, that “whilst I considered myself not half-paid for my services, I would not accept of the proposed increase.— </p>
         <p>“This was my expression then: this is my determinaton now.—</p>
         <p>“It is true, that, subsequently, the Members for Waipukurau both severally said (in this office), that they regretted what had been said; and had they but fully known how things really were, no opposition would or could have been made, &amp;c., &amp;c. Yet, as such statements were only made to me privately, I cannot allow them to have any weight towards altering my publicly expressed resolution.</p>
         <p>“At the same time, Sir, I desire most heartily to fulfil the duties of my office as Provincial Auditor: and all the assistance I can possibly render you in all your public transactions with the Natives, either as Interpreter or Native Secretary, I hope also to be ever ready to give to the utmost of my ability while I may have the honor to hold my present office.—</p>
         <p>		(signed) “<hi rend="smallcaps">William Colenso</hi>.”</p>
         <p>Which answer of mine I have also acted upon,—having only drawn, on the 31st Jauuary last; my old and usual pay,—<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. £12. 10s.</p>
         <p>And here I would submit two plain questions—1st.,—What <hi rend="italic">new duties</hi> have I now to perform, which I had not from the date of his Honor’s letter to me in June last? And, 2nd.,—What new office have I that I should again be called to resign the seat in the Council to which the electors of the town had elected me?</p>
         <p>Sir, I have no doubt but that the many who read this will quite agree with me, and reply alike to each question,—<hi rend="smallcaps">None</hi>. “<hi rend="italic">Then why did you resign</hi>” will of course follow; and to this very proper enquiry I have an answer ready.—</p>
         <p>——Because I know that it would very soon be said, (by those who are waiting for opportunities,)— “Co1enso shirks the question!” “Colenso is afraid to resign and go again to his constituents!” And so, rather than such shall be said of your Member,—rather than give them the merest semblance of a hold upon me—and through me, the Council or the Electors of the town,—I have taken the “short cut” and resigned, to cast myself again in all open confidence upon the good-will of the town of Napier.</p>
         <p>		I am, Sir,</p>
         <p>		Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="smallcaps">		William Colenso</hi>.</p>
         <p> Napier, Feb. 7, 1860.</p>
