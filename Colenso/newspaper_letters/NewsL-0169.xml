      <body>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I was pleased to see in your paper a few days back,a prompt call for assistance on behalf of the distressed wife and family of the late J.B. Pullen, who for some years had been the zealous caretaker of the Theatre Royal, and who died on the 9<hi rend="sup ">th </hi>inst., and I have been waiting to see how it would be responded to. For you informed us—that the deceased man was very assiduous and very useful in his various occupations; a fact acknowledged (you say) by all, and especially by those who had been performers in the theatre. And it occurred to me, that, knowing that fact, you should have come out more openly, more equitably, and called on (at least) the three classes I now proceed to name,—to come forward <hi rend="italic">quickly</hi> in this good cause.</p>
         <p>1. The theatre-supporters, who flock in crowds to every performance! which is carried on almost every night in the week, and who, also, must have been largely benefited by the poor man’s active and strenuous endeavours.</p>
         <p>2. The bands of local amateur players and concert singers who have often (especially of late in their repeated “<hi rend="italic">Les Cloches de Corneville</hi>,” &amp;c., &amp;c., ) performed therein to “overflowing houses,” and reaped largely.</p>
         <p>3. This present or late large batch of performers, who were carrying-on in the Theatre on Thursday night while a poor man lay dying in an adjoining room,—and also on the Friday night while lying dead; and who again did so on the Saturday night (the day of his hastened burial), and also on the following Sunday evening! Surely, <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, at all events—seeing the Theatre was crowded (as you say), and that too early during Church hours,—a share at least of the amount collected might be disgorged!</p>
         <p>In these three classes coming out quickly and fairly lovingly, they will be (I hope) doing a little in the <hi rend="italic">only way </hi>of “making to themselves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness” as advised by the Great teacher.</p>
         <p>I could say more but I refrain; only this:—Seeing the Theatres here are so extensively patronised, I think a rule or by-law something like this should be established, namely,—that all performers therein (especially non-resident strolling players) should be made to contribute a fixed per-centage of their gains for charitable purposes—especially such as this.</p>
         <p>I dare to think of myself, that I would not willingly be the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>to help in all such cases (particularly as in this one, being my neighbour,) but <hi rend="italic">I am late </hi>on this occasion. I gladly now enclose my mite, £2 2s.—I am, &amp;c,</p>

         <p>FOR COUGHS AND COLDS.—Gowing’s Linctus is still in steady demand as it has been for the past 30 years. The Rev. W. Colenso, F.R.S., thus writes of this remedy:—“I consider it to be a vauable and safe medicine, of great service in Coughs, Colds, Bronchial Affections, and Irritation and Dryness of the Throat. I always carry a bottle with me when I visit the bush district.”—H. Owens, Chemist, Napier.</p>

         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>, In common with many others I have been much interested (or I may truly enough say concerned) in reading the public accounts of the late disastrous flood at Clive and its adjacent low-lying lands; and also, in considering Mr Knorpp’s (old) “river conservation scheme,” recently republished by you; and the official “report” of Messrs Carr and Kennedy, C.E’s, on the sune subject to the River Board at Ciive, aho published by you in your issue of the 8th inst. And, no doubt a very great cause of my thinking so much over this late calamity, arises from my having often suffered from floods myself during my long residence of nearly 20 years in that neighborhood; when, too, I experienced a bigger flood than this one of December last, and was wholly <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>—as to European neighbours and aid! And happening to mention this circumstance in conversation with a few friends, I have been solicited to give the public some account of it; this I now propose to do in your columns,—premising, that all I shall now write about that one big flood is strictly copied from my journal written at the time; which also was duly forwarded to the C. M. S., London,—it being a part of the duty of their missionaries to keep a daily jonrnal for the society. And as the very site of my old residence has been long ago washed away by the floods and ever encroaching sea, I may first point out its position, so as to enable your readers and the residents in general of Napier and Hawke’s Bay to know something more about it.</p>
         <p>I first visited the Hawke’s Bay district and travelled largely through it more than 50 years ago (in 1843), and returned hither in 1844 to reside permanently. In 1843 Archdeacon W. Williams (afterwards Bishop of Waiapu) and myself—in travelling north from Castlepoint— halted at Te Awapuni (a pretty large pa or fenced village of the Maoris) on the Waitangi creek, where, after long discussion by the chiefs it was finally arranged that a small rectangular block of land containing 10 acres, on the opposite side of the creek, should be granted as a Mission Station; and this plot the late chief Te Hapuku and myself stepped out, with no small difficulty from tbe dense and entangled herbage growing on it. A long row of blackberry bushes running nearly east and west (to the north of Farndon, and near the east bend of the said Waitangi creek) still marks the ditch and dyke fence and Boundary to the south of my old outer grass paddock. At that time, and for several years after, the Waitangi creek—where it ran parallel with the seabeach and joined the Ngaruroro river —was only a very small and narrow water-course. I have often crossed it at low water without taking off my boots; and there was also a large piece of high and dry stony land, containing several acres, and covered with low herbage, lying between tbe said Waitangi creek and the outer north boundary of tbe Mission station. </p>
         <p>In returning overland, on foot, to the Bay of Islands fion Hawke’s Bay, in 1843, I took with me four strong young Maoris (men), one from each sub-tribe ; and during my absence in 1844 (a mnch longer one than I had expected), the resident Maori chiefs—being aided by some skilful Maori housebuilders, friends from Poverty Bay, erected a very large and substantial house for me, on a rising knoll—the highest thereabouts—within tbe said marked-off plot;—this, of course, I had to finish and to render habitable—with floors, partitions, doors, windows, chimneys, &amp;c.,— a work extending over several years, partly owing to the building being a very large one, the main portion 50 x 36, one story, but very lofty, with its floors and extra deep joists of kauri timber, and the joists crossed over large whole pine, tree trunks newly felled in the Big Bush and brought down the river Ngaruroro for that especial purpose: so that the floors of the house were raised several feet above the gronnd around it: and all this extra labour and trouble and expense I underwent through (fortunately) detecting on my arrival in 1841, many small water-loving and marsh plants growing there about the house, though the ground was then perfectly dry, being the middle of summer; and here and there, also, small washed and rounded pebbles of pumice, scattered among the tufts of herbage and fern,—which eloquently, though silently, told their tale! I now relate this, by way of letting folks know something of my then situation and position. </p>
         <p>And here, no doubt, someone will naturally say,— “Why, on earth did you two select such a low spot for a Mission Station; when you had all Hawke's Bay open before you?” But the fact was—there was no selection in it, no choice whatever; either that, or none! And this arose from a curious cause, or reasons, viz.— l. That a missionary in coming hither to reside for all the Maoris must not belong to one sub-tribe more than to another, for if he were to reside near to a pa (or large village) he would then be considered as belonging to than sub-tribe there dwelling, and so the others would not (and could not, according to Maori custom and to their extreme jealousy ) visit him freely. 2. That therefore, as this tongue of lowland, surrounded on three sides by the Waitangi and Ngaruroro rivers was <hi rend="italic">tapu</hi>, (a strictly tabooed preserve for pigs and for marsh and water birds and for eels,) this small plot, a kind of “No Man’s Land,” was by all agreed to as being equally free to all of them; but even this was only determined on after two or three days’ deep consultation by the Maori chiefs then and there assembled.—I now give the extracts from my old Journal.</p>
         <p>“1847. June 23rd.—Returned late this evening to the Mission Station, having been absent trom the 12th inst., viewing the Maoris in the villages to the north—Tangoio, Aropaoanui, Petane, and Wharerangi, a most disagreeable journey owing to the cold and wet winter weather, short days, and no roads,—walking through mud and marshes, slippery, clayey hills, and wet fern! Wind very high to-day with every appearance of a heavy gale coming on. </p>
         <p>“24th.—A very stormy day indeed of wind and rain; the most so of any gale from the N.E. since I came hither to reside; great fears expressed by the Maoris living near me of a heavy flood. </p>
         <p>“25th.—Pouring rain all night without intermission; tbe wind, too, terrifically strong, and the sea awfully roaring and lashing over the high bank in front of the house; the bank itself being 2 or 3 feet higher than the ground on which the house stands, and only 150 yards from it. Rain continuing all day, and the waters rising rapidly all round; the low plains disappearing fast. We hoped, however, that our dwelling house would escape, it being situated on a rising spot, with its floors raised more than 2 feet above the ground Towards evening our raised pathways through the garden and paddock began to disappear, and our Maori domestic lads were obliged to evacuate their house, and we to abandon the kitchen (detached) which was now under water. Tbe incessant dashing of the waters against the fences, &amp;c, being fearfully agitated by tbe stormy wind, added not a little to the appalling nature of the scene. At 8 pm. tbe verandah floor, although about a foot above the raised pathway, was under water, and at the same time the floor of our newly erected store was also covered. The wind now subsided, and the rain ceased, but tbe furious sea effectually damming up the only open and narrow mouth of the 3 rivers (which here disembogue into the ocean) caused the waters rushing from the hill country to be returned again over tbe low lands with frightful velocity. Tbe water had still, however, 6 inches to rise to reach the level of the dwelling-house floors, and 15 inches to reach the floor of the study in the garden; so we still dared to hope we might yet escape. Our goats and pigs, which crowded about us, we took away in canoes to a little rising bank or ridge only a few feet in diameter, a short distance off, there to await the result; our dogs and cats came into the house; while the remnant of our poultry (which had escaped the flood in March last) took refuge on the fence, and on the roof of the house. Narrowly, indeed, did we watch the rise of the water,—as breathlessly as any Egyptian sage ever watched the Nilometer. Seeing it was still rising rapidly we proceeded to make platforms within the house by joining tables together, &amp;c, and to raise up boxes and cases on each other, and to pull out the lower drawers of chests of drawers, &amp;c, &amp;c. At 9 p.m. my Maori teacher Renata came across the plains from his little village in a canoe, stating that his place, which is a much higher spot than this of ours, was totally under water, and the river Ngaruroro coming over its banks in that direction at a fearfal rate. The few Maoris who happened to be there, women and children, fled to their <hi rend="italic">patakas</hi> (raised food platforms on posts) for refuge, while the men, with a large number of others from all the villages around, had proceeded to the sea beach to try to cut tbe dam through. I got my whaleboat and oars and big canoe fastened to the fence of my entrance gate, to be in readiness if we should be obliged to leave; which done, we sought for bricks in tbe back yard wherewith to raise the fireplace on the hearth in the sitting-room, so as to be able to keep a little of that necessary article at hand; those bricks (left from building our two chimneys) could only be obtained by one of my young Maori lads diving for them, and bringing them to Renata, who was staying with us. At 10 p.m. tbe waters began to enter the house, and soon rushed through, making a clean sweep. I then threw open all the doors and windows (French casements) to give the flood free egress. Now we were obliged to carry the dogs out and place them in the big canoe, and to begin to take refuge ourselves upon tables and chairs, and piled boxes. There we sat in the cold night, looking at each other and the still rising flood, and fearing that the worst was yet to come, as it wanted 4 hours of high water. We also feared that the flood would raise the floors <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>— as they were only now kept down by the slight rush and reed partitions, which were merely nailed to the rafters of the roof,—and so force off the heavy roof above us! We still cherished a hope that the study might escape, as its floor was 9 inches higher than that of the dwelling-house; and so we kept anxiously looking at the legs of the tables and chairs as their knobs were successively reached by the water, and when it had risen 6 inches over the floor of our sitting-room, I lost no time in paddling to the study in a canoe (which was brought into the sitting-room through the verandah and open doorway) over the flowers and shrubs and gooseberry bushes! We got there just in time to do what we could (which was little enough!) to secure the books, papers, specimens, boxes, &amp;c , &amp;c, from present wet, for before we had finished the water began to pour in over the floor! This was the only blow that I acutely felt. I had considered the stores and goods which would unavoidably be lost and spoiled as scarcely worth a thought, but when I left my books and papers to their approaching fate it cost me a pang. It was now a still serene night—or rather morning, the declining moon shone brightly,—not a cloud in the sky,—not a sound to be heard save the swiftly rushing ripple of the current as it shot past—the faint snorting of a drowning pig, which ever and anon broke upon the ear,—the plaintive wail of the sandpiper as it flitted about, seeking rest for the sole of its foot, and the quick succeeding waves of the sea which vehemently dashed over the high bank in front of the house in mad confusion. However, we returned in our canoe to the dwelling-house, and took our seats as before upon our temporary platforms of tables, stools, and boxes. During our absence at the study, Renata, who had remained behind in charge of the fire, had again to raise the fire-place, making the fourth tier of bricks built up on the iron dogs; and now we could only just see the little fire by looking horizontally, as it was only a few inches (less than the thickness of another brick,) below the flat open arch of the chimney fire-place. Renata had kept the young Maori diving for bricks in the cold muddy water, a job he did not like, owing to the strength of the current, the night season, and the increasing difficulty of finding the scattered bricks which had to be groped for; and, worst of all to a Maori! no fire to warm himself by.”</p>
         <p>[And here I should also mention a curious device of Renata; he, naked save his big shaggy black body mat, had a chair early allotted to him for a seat, but, the water rising rapidly, he put 4 bricks under the 4 legs of the chair to raise it, and this he had to repeat twice over, so as to be quite above the flood, and there he sat still, and slept (at last !) for some honrs, squatting quietly—without even the solace of a pipe, such not being in common use in those happier days. I confess, I felt uneasy on Renata’s account, fearing he might fall off bis perch in his sleep, and so get a cold bath, and wet his thick warm mat.] </p>
         <p>To continue:— “Just at this time a very large and raised log (a whole white pine trunk with its bark on), on which the turkeys had taken refuge, was carried off over the close lower fences (6 feet high). With great difficulty we saved 5 of them out of 10. At 3 o’clock a.m. two or three Maoris in a small canoe came up to the house, bringing the pleasing news that the great dam, or high beach bank, had been cut through, for which we all truly and devoutly thanked God and took courage. Shortly after we found the water to be at a stand, and in about an hour to decrease—slowly indeed, but surely. We now hoped the worst was over, and being much fatigued and cold (for it was very cold from it being midwinter as well as from having so much water about us), we endeavored to wrap ourselves up, and to get a little sleep, squatting on our platforms, ere day should break upon us. </p>
         <p>“26th.—We, each and all hands, dozed 2 or 3 hours upon our confined seats—like fowls upon their perches—which refreshed us a little for future action. For by daylight the fast retiring waters plainly showed what a benefit they had brought us, in a stratum of fine mud, which not only covered the floors, but had found its way into every box or case however tightly nailed into which the waters entered. In some places the deposit of mud was from 10 to 16 inches thick; the general layer being from 3 to 8 inches. We worked hard all day in getting two or three rooms put a little to rights. About 3 p.m. my horse came up—where or how he escaped we conld not tell. The few natives who remained in their village, Te Awapuni pa, on the opposite shore of the river where the land is considerably higher, were obliged to retreat by degrees before the rising flood—which completely covered the whole village (overthrowing its strong fences), together with the church yard and floor of the large church beyond it; a portion, too, of the newly erected and strong close (paled) totara fence of the church-yard was thrown down. A whole stack of wheat floated down from its staddle on the high ground at Te Ngaaue (a village 4 miles off beyond Pakowhai), and curiously enough was carried by the current into the village here (Te Awapuni), and there set down whole between the houses, as if it had been originally stacked there, bringing with it a whole colony of rats, and, on the ontside, a large number of <hi rend="italic">Pukeko</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">Porphyrio melanonotus</hi>). About noon it again recommenced raining heavily, and blowing strongly from the N.E. </p>
         <p>“Sunday, 27th.—Morning fine, but the whole country for miles in every direction under water or mud, or both! </p>
         <p>“23th–30th.—Still raining hard and blowing strong. Scarcely any getting outside of the doors, goods and stores all ruining from so long exposure to the wet; some large cases having been nearly 2 feet submerged in water, and others completely beneath. The weather during the whole of this month had been little else than rain. </p>
         <p>“July 1,—Weather clearing; all hands turned to work, to scrape mud out of houses and rooms—to open boxes, and cases. Iron and tinware, books, clothing, drapery, salt, oil, sugar, and other groceries, carpenters’ tools, &amp;c., &amp;c., in a most pitiable condition. Such was the subtile state of the mud or slime that it found its way into close and new cases which had never baen opened since their first nailing down in England! In the afternoon it again came on to blow with rain. </p>
         <p>“2nd.—Heavy rain all night, but morning fine. Continuing our onerous work of yesterday. This afternoon Tareha, one of the principal chiefs of this district, and his relative Isaac, brought back my horse; the animal had actually swum across the harbor at Ahuriri, spite of the enormous current, and got in safety to the opposite shore to the great astonishment of the Maoris residing there. It seemed as if the horse had had quite enough of the marshes of Heretaunga, and was going back to its old quarters at Wairoa or Poverty Bay. The Maoris, however, followed it, and after some difficulty (for they had never handled a horse before) succeeded in capturiug it. Tareha’s object in coming was, mainly, to condole with me. Among other things he said— ‘No one ever dwelt here on this spot before you; it has always been only the dwelling-place of eels.’ We scarcely knew what to do with the horse, as nearly the whole neighbourhood is under mud, which is in some places very deep; and if returned to the ridge of the dry stony beach leading to the Port, where there is scarcely a single bite of grass, it would again try tbe sea at Ahuriri;—as to onr few cows we know nothing of them.” </p>
         <p>In a few days we heard the cows were safe; they bad been early noticed by Maoris of Pakowhai going towards the distant hills through the waters of the rising floods, and they kindly drove them on in that direction. The horse was again taken across the creek to the dry shingle beach, and there tethered by a long rope and left in charge of a Maori: but though its life was preserved on this occasion it perished during the following year from another severe flood—(during my absence on my long annual journey) to the great grief ot the Maoris, who composed and sang songs and dirges over it, after sharing among them the black hair of its mane and tail! It was a fine young animal, reared and broken in at Poverty Bay, a bright bay with black points, very docile, quite a pet with the Maoris, who would often bring it a bundle of leafy shrubs from Tukituki, as there were none around me, neither grass for some years; name Cæsar. It was never ridden by me, and being the first horse introduced to Hawke’s Bay deserves a brief notice. And here I may also mention that my best cow—a pretty well-formed red poley, picked trom Rev. S. Marsden’s herd at Parramatta, N. S. W. —was also (unfortunately for me) killed by the large pig dogs of my Maori neighbors. Having mentioned the Maori Renata as heartily rendering good assistance at the time of the flood (and so did all tho others, domestics: we were about 10 there gathered together on that eventful night, the larger number being women and children), I should also add that this Maori is the same Renata Te Kawepo who years afterwards became so well known here among the settlers as a prominent and wealthy chieftain, and who died a few years ago. I had brought him hither with me from the North in 1844, and for several years Renata did good and trusty service both to me and to the Church. </p>
         <p>I have incidentally mentioned having a large stock of groceries, &amp;c., in hand; this, also, may require explanation. On my coming hither in 1844, knowing my complete isolation, I brought with me a ton of flour, half ton of rice and sugar, two half chests of tea, &amp;c., &amp;c., because then there were no shops nor stores nearer than Auckland and Wellington, and no vessels visiting here; and so it continued to be for some time after my arrival. I was early obliged to purchase largely at Wellington, hence my loss became heavy; and, as a matter of course, it all fell on me—in spite of repeated appeal, the C. M. Society then not being wealthy. </p>
         <p>During my long residence there I witnessed many other severe floods, some very heavy (which always depended on the mouths of the rivers being closed), but none before or since so big as the one in June 1847. I may, however, mention that I suffered more loss from a big flood in 1845 than I did from this one, owing to my being totally unprepared for that earlier one, and knowing nothing of its severity; on that occasion I lost nearly all my large stock of flour, sugar, rice, &amp;c., (and all hands suffered according for some time)—and, alas, my first crop of rye-grass and white clover growing on cleaned and enclosed ground, an acre and half, dug with worry, great labour, and expense; this was totally buried in silt, and smothered and killed when young, and had to be resown the following season. </p>
         <p>I have also known a much deeper deposit of silt (fine mud) than was left by the big flood of June 1847. On one particular occasion there was an enormous deposit, measuring in some spots on my own paddocks 2 feet 4 inches deep after the waters had drained off. Of this early flood, during which the dammed up waters remained for a long time high, I had to write an official account for the Superintendent of Wellington (Dr. Featherston), at his request; Hawke’s Bay being then deemed part of the Province of Wellington. </p>
         <p>I got, at last, to welcome a gently rising tranquil flood that merely covered the paddocks and gardens a few inches in depth, and soon drained off, especially if followed by rain; as such natueal irrigation always wonderfully enriched the grasses and soil. On one occiaion I noticed a peculiar natural phenomenon; the advance waters from the two rivers, Ngaruroro and Tutaekuri, quietly meeting and mingling in my flat paddock; that of the Tutaekuri being almost clear and of a bluish cast, while that of Ngaruroro was yellowish and very mnddy, by which they were well defined. Of course, whenever the Tataekuri overflowed and ran east towards Cape Kidnappers, joining the other two rivers, the flood was very high. I have said that during the flood the Maoris of the large pa, Te Awapuni, had to desert it, and to retreat to the higher ridge of the shingle hank (a raised beach) leading to the port; on this occasion leaving in the night they had to make two or three bivouacs as the rising waters gained on the ground. This, however, they had done during a former flood, and also again afterwards. It was a curious natural sight—one that often raised the question among our early and observing settlers and visitors—to see the pumice stones and boulders forming an almost regular border-line high up on this long shingle bank, as if placed there in a row end to end by children in play. This line, however, showed the height of the inundation; those worn lumps and boulders of pumice having been carried thither by the flood and quietly deposited, presenting a kind of high-water mark. </p>
         <p>On my arrival here in 1844, the Maoris were scattered in many very small villages all over the plains, from Clifton (the cliffs of Cape Kidnappers range of hills) to Taipo and Puketapu, and inland as far as Pakipaki, causing me an immense amount of heavy and laborious travelling, always on foot, to visit them and their sick. What made it the more difficult was there being no roads, not even pathways, leading to their hamlets; and the jungle on all those marshy flats was of the coarsest and most luxuriant character, intersected in all directions with deep ditches and pools of mud and water, making it difficult to find one's way through it. Indeed, the Maoris themselves rarely or never travelled anywhere overland, choosing always to go by water in their small canoes, particularly on all those tidal rivers and their branches, coming and returning with the tide and river current; time then with them being of no importance. </p>
         <p>Four things I had early noticed in my travelling across those flats respecting the rivers of this great low delta or watershed: 1. That they had often changed their channels (owing to the loose nature of the gronnd, and probably earth disturbance). 2. That they were much higher on their immediate banks (though running through lands pretty nearly level on both sides) than the land itself was a little way in from the river. 3 The margins of those banks also carried a much more dense vegetation than the land immediately beyond them, owing to the vegetation itself on the margins of the streams always catching and retaining floating plants and debris at times of overflowing. 4. That this was a great natural means of causing the overflowing waters to move slowly and to spread more equably with less force of ourrent. Moreover, everywhere concealed among the reeds and coarse cutting grasses of those marshy flats were innumerable prostrate trees and big branches and rotten logs, which also served to retard the current of the rising floods. But on the arrival of settlers in this district those natural features began to disappear; by their clearing and firing the said dense jungle, their using and destroying the logs and prostrate trees, and through their cattle breaking down the high margins and banks of the several streams, and the consequent rolling of their debris into their channels; hence it is that the rivers and streamlets have become shallowed, and not merely from shingle or silt brought down by the current from a distance above. Farther, the enormous quantity of surface water now flowing from the numerous artesian wells must also be considered as largely tending to augment a flood and to give an impetus to its current. </p>
         <p>The wise old Maoris well knew of those floods, and in a measure were generally well prepared for them. Their losses at such times were chiefly confined to their canoes and eel and fish pots and traps (all, however, being their valuable and substantial property), and whenever any one of their low-lying villages was inundated (which, I believe, was never occasioned except when the mouth, or mouths, of the rivers were dammed) their general mode of acting was to unite and cut through the thrown-up sea-bank as quickly as possible This was done several times by them during my early years at Waitangi; and my belief has ever been, that such a work only is required to keep all those lowlying lands on those rivers and at their mouths free from floods,—<hi rend="italic">to see that their mouths are kept open</hi>; and that, particularly such should be the case with the mouth of the Ngaruroro river, separate from that of the Tukituki. This is the old proved plan; and is the natural and reasonable and cheaper and most effectual mode of dealing with the floods, in my estimation. </p>
         <p>There is yet another patent factor which shonld certainly not be lost sight of, viz., <hi rend="italic">volcanic action</hi>; and that for these reasons: That the whole of this district has been not only subject to it, but that the tendency has ever been in one direction—upheaval, of this we have plenty of proof all around us; and (geologically speaking) as to time, much of that action has taken place in recent ages. Indeed, I myself have known and marked such earth surface alterations, as to altitude, during my early years here; and while earthquakes were pretty frequent, and severe too, 40 years ago (say from 1843 to 1855), there have not been any strong ones in this district for the last 30 years; but we well know that those ancient powerful forces are all here handy, stored in reserve in Nature's magazine, though for the time being latent; and when by her need—called into action—no warning notice is ever given. </p>
         <p>My letter is unpardonably long for your columns (although I have striven to condense it), yet, as it is on a grave and important subject, affecting many among us, much of it unknown, and not, I think, wholly uninteresting to Hawke’s Bay settlers, I trust its length will be forgiven by the public and yourself.—I am, &amp;c., </p>

         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Permit me to correct an error in your paper of this morning concerning your mountain grass, which I the more readily desire to do as you say it is a correction by some “well-informed correspondent,”—who also gives a wrong botanical name to the grass in question, calling it <hi rend="italic">Holcus</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">indicus</hi>. There is no such species of <hi rend="italic">Holcus</hi> known as <hi rend="italic">H.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">indicus</hi>. Your grass is <hi rend="italic">Holcus lanatus</hi>, a very common European grass, and now become a Cosmopolite; its universal old English name is “<hi rend="italic">meadow soft grass</hi>.” It has long been naturalised in New Zealand (here, on the sides of this hill, for instance). Hooker in his “Flora of New Zealand,” written nearly 50 years ago, mentions it. Moreover there are but two species of this genus <hi rend="italic">Holcus</hi>; this one, and <hi rend="italic">H. mollis</hi>, much like it in general appearance. Wherever your “well-informed correspondent” picked up the foreign and far-fetched term of “<hi rend="italic">indicus</hi>,” is a mystery to me. And so I may say of the low provincialism—“Yorkshire fog”!! Why take up and continue to use such a term? For two or three years, I myself, who had never before heard of this name,—never met with it in print,—could not understand what was meant by it. </p>
         <p>And just so of another introduced weed, here in the Colony called “the Californian Thistle,”—as if, forsooth, it were new and a plant of that American State! whereas it is also a common British weed—<hi rend="italic">creeping</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">plume, thistle</hi>, its proper botanical name being <hi rend="italic">Crucus arvensis</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps italic">not </hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cardtuus arvensis</hi>)<hi rend="italic">. </hi>
               </p>
         <p>But it would fill a column or two of your paper to point out those common glaring modern botanical names and errors respecting many old well-known British weeds that have been introduced and now are naturalised here among us. Too much fuss made about them.—I am, &amp;c.,</p>
