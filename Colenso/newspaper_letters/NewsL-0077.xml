         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—As you have “trotted me out pretty freely” in your columns during the last fortnight, perhaps you will now allow me to have my say respecting the whole matter in question; although I may, possibly, (and in order to clear it), take up a little more of your “Correspondence” space than is usually allowed, But, I am not the aggressor; you have provoked it. All I ask, is a “fair field and no favor.”—</p>
         <p>I should, perhaps, have written before, only I had no spare time,—having been for a fortnight absent in the Country visiting schools, and since my return engaged in writing for the Education Board; and (speaking for myself,) I am a little too thick-skinned, after so many year’s of Public Service, greatly to heed the tilts of Lilliputian reeds and lances! And even now I don’t think I should care to write on this matter, were it not for your own sub-article in your paper of the 1st April. For all my doings, as the Inspector of Schools,<note xml:id="ftn35" place="foot" n="35"> Colenso’s resignation from his post as Inspector of Schools was reported in the <hi rend="italic">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> of 18 March 1878, and a number of letters were published in the following issues—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
                  </note> have always been open and before the whole public,—especially Teachers, Scholars, Parents, and, more recently, the Board of Education. And happy am I,—aye, far beyond many other public officers,—in being able both to believe and to say, that <hi rend="italic">I have them all with me!</hi> At the same time, I think, it will be allowed, that no one has a more arduous duty to perform than an Inspector,—whether he be one of Roads, Gaols, Asylums, Railways, Public Works, Steamers, Sheep, or Schools; the duty, if performed truly, is a heavy one entailing a great responsibility:—on the one hand all look to him; on the other, if he, in the least, touches, or approaches, vested interests, rights, or properties, fancied or real, the many interested “have a down” on him! So that thrice happy is that individual who can well and truly perform his duty without giving great offence.</p>
         <p>In your paper of last Monday (April 1st) you say— “With reference to the subject of Mr. Colenso’s resignation, the undesirableness of allowing an Inspector to have any voice whatever in the appointment of Schoolmasters, is, to our mind, quite palpable.” (With much more to the same effect.) And your friend “Alpha,” whose letter you published the next day, (but which letter you had had some time by you, as I find from your paper of March 30,) writes very much in the same strain, only more flippantly and thoughtlessly, or (I might truly enough say,) wildly.—For instance,—where “Alpha,” lashing himself up to a white heat like an angry tom-cat, asks— “Who invested our late Inspector with superior authority in educational matters? Or, on what grounds does he arrogate to himself the right of being consulted respecting the appointment of teachers? If the reason assigned for Mr Colenso’s resignation be correct, they imply an amount of assumption and presumption seldom equalled far less surpassed.” And, again,— “Mr Colenso had no right to arrogate to himself functions which nowhere pertain to his office,” &amp;c., &amp;c., (!!) High-flown language and heavy words these on the part of “Alpha;” but, unfortunately for him, and for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, too, they have no foundation whatever! as I will show.—</p>
         <p>Here, however, I halt, to enquire, whether you were led astray by “Alpha,” or “Alpha” by you?—</p>
         <p>His letter was in your possession and read by you on or before the 30th March, but your remarks were first published. And (to this I would call particular attention,) had you in your lengthy Report of the meeting of the Education Board held on the 18<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>. March, (fair and good as far as it goes, but, unfortunately, with a most important <hi rend="italic">suppressio veri</hi>,) had you then published <hi rend="italic">the grounds </hi>of my Resignation it would have saved you, as Editor, from subsequently committing yourself in your sub-article,—and, possibly your friend “Alpha” also from his rash writing! In that Report of yours you rightly mention “my official letter to the Board of February 9, 1878,” and the “direct opposition” thereto on the part of “the Board,” as being the chief grounds of my Resignation; but you do not inform the Public as to the contents of my letter or its meaning! Probably you never cared to know anything about it,—though professedly the caterer for the public in all important public matters! and so, through your supineness, both yourself and your friend “Alpha” are where you are,—between the horns!—</p>
         <p>And now I will give the Public a copy of that Official letter.—</p>
         <p>“Napier, February 9th, 1878.</p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—I have the honour to call the attentive consideration of the Board to the following, viz.:—</p>
         <p>1. That, unless in case of very great emergency,— “No person shall be eligible for appointment as Teacher to any school who does not produce a Certificate of competency from the Minister of Education, <hi rend="italic">and </hi>such other Certificates of fitness as shall be required”—(in conformity with clause 45 of the Education Act). I trust this clause will be borne in mind by the Board,—even in cases in which Committees should ask for the Board’s appointment of any one specially recommended by them (the Committees) as Teacher. For it is to this being upheld and carried out in its integrity by the Board,—and also to Section 3 of the same clause 45),—that I look forward to much real good rising to some of our Schools.</p>
         <p>2. That, as a general rule, no Teacher shall be removed from one Government school, where he is the Teacher, to another, merely on his bare letter to the Board asking for such removal; or, on the mere letter of the Committee, of that School, asking for his removal from the School where he is the Teacher to their School: to effect any such removal some very sound reasons should be adduced.</p>
         <p>3. That the several local School Committees be early informed by the Board of their adoption of the above for their (the Committees’) guidance.</p>
         <p>For, unless these rules are generally rigidly adhered to by the Board, and also made known by them, many slightly-considered applications will be sent in to the Board, and much undesigned mischief may arise to several of our rising Schools; for Schools do not generally profit by change of Teachers, and never by the loss of good ones; for when Teacher and School well know each other they always work more cordially and advance more rapidly.</p>
         <p> (Signed) W.<hi rend="smallcaps">Colenso</hi>, I.S.”</p>
         <p> The Chairman,	<lb/>	Hawke’s Bay Board of	<lb/>		Education, Napier.</p>
         <p>I think that all will plainly see what I sought in that letter. Certainly no wish on my part; to <hi rend="italic">appoint</hi> Teachers anywhere; neither “assumption” nor “presumption,” neither “arrogancy” nor “the asserting of superior authority,” (as your friend “Alpha” says,)—but only the upholding the rights of our Teachers and the good of our children; and so not to leave them altogether to the tender mercies of a hastily-chosen and ill-assorted local “Bush” Committee.</p>
         <p>But <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Mr Editor,—from your long knowledge of me and from the published annual Reports of the Schools,—you should have both known me better and also my official doings during the 7 years I have held the office of Inspector of Schools (I say nothing of the earlier time, when I was also Inspector of Schools, 1861–4). Did you ever know me once to make an appointment of a teacher or, even to seek to do so? Were not all the several Teachers of Schools who have been appointed during (say) the last 7 years, so appointed by the local Trustees of the various Schools? In the past 7 years I made <hi rend="italic">one</hi> recommendation to the then Superintendent of the Province, (and that because there were no local Trustees there,) viz. to Norsewood Scandinavian School; and, recently, I recommended to the Board, at a time of serious exigency, (as you well know,) Mr Gush, and Mr Wright: these are all my (so called) “appointments;” and I believe the Public concerned will generally support me in them.</p>
         <p>“Alpha” has one sentence in which I cordially agree;— “Doubtless Boards will always attach considerable importance to the opinions of Inspectors and rightly so.” Now that is all I have asked, and should ask, for. My official letters to the Board shew this. I find, moreover, that the Educational Boards of Wellington and of Auckland pay very great consideration to their Inspectors, with respect to the appointment of Teachers. In the Auckland <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi> of March 9th, to hand <hi rend="italic">since</hi> the date of my letter of Resignation, (I quote from memory, not having that paper now by me,)—in their Report, occupying two columns, of the proceedings of the then last weekly meeting of the Auckland Education Board, it is stated,—that, out of between 30 and 40 matters concerning their Country Schools, all separately named,—there were 9 respecting Teachers: of these nine, five were appointed (<hi rend="italic">mark</hi>!) on the recommendation of the Inspector, while four, being new, were deferred for the Inspector’s report thereon. The Auckland Board has, also, the further advantage of an <hi rend="italic">Examining Committee</hi>.</p>
         <p>Of course, this speaks volumes! and wholly upsets both your and your friend “Alpha’s” views on this subject. At the same time, the concluding sentence of “Alpha’s” first letter I wholly agree with; he says,— “However capable Inspectors may be of giving advice, Boards must exercise their own discretion as to the right course to be pursued in filling up vacancies, and be specially careful to throw no obstacle in the way of the promotion of <hi rend="italic">really deserving teachers</hi>. And no less necessary will it be to see that the Act is fairly and impartially carried out, and that no influences, denominational, political, or otherwise, are allowed to prevent this from being done.”</p>
         <p>And, I think, it will be surely found, that, whoever may hold the high office of Inspector of Schools,—if he be a fit and proper person, and if he also does his duty,—that his official opinion generally in the matter of Teachers, cannot, ought not, must not be set lightly aside; for he is the permanent and skilled officer; he knows the Teachers all, well; he knows moreover, the <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> requirements of each and every School and School District which a Board, changing as it does and must every year, cannot possibly personally and really know. And as to the Inspector being “biassed,” and “having favourites of his own appointment,” &amp;c., &amp;c., and all that kind of trashy gallimantry brought forward so prominently by “Alpha”!—surely all that may safely be left to the Teachers themselves and the Public,—to the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Herald</hi>. Let <hi rend="italic">our Experience</hi> of the past speak! May I not, in going out of office as Samuel of old, ask, aye proudly ask,— “Witness against me: Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed?” in this matter of Teachers.—</p>
         <p>One word respecting “Alpha,” and I have done with him. In his <hi rend="italic">first</hi> letter he begins by saying,— “On reading “P.F’s.” letter, one is reminded, that however satisfactory a man’s reasons for his course of conduct may appear to himself, he is wise to keep them to himself.” And, again, in his <hi rend="italic">second</hi> letter, (so quickly written, too, after the former one, as if “to order”!) he begins with saying,— “It is astonishing how absurd people can be when blinded by their own selfish interests. None are so blind as those who do not wish to see.” Aye, “Alpha,” just so, I would reply; only adding two other classes; the one, who ignorantly rushes into a war of words, not knowing or understanding the causes; to which class “Alpha” certainly belongs:—the other, that of those venal hacks, or scribblers, who, possessing a little smattering of apparent knowledge and a spice of cleverness, (resembling the quick smart dashing of the swallow glancing in the sunbeam,) take up matters for pay or profit. Let “Alpha” look to this—And let him also remember—that assumption and abuse of an adversary is not argument. One is always strongly reminded, when a writer jumps out, or bolts,—in that kind of way, like “Alpha,”—of the old saying,— “No case, abuse the counsel.” Very sure I am , that “P.F.,” (whoever he may be) understood the matter he was writing of far, far, beyond the poor comprehension of “Alpha”—(who, however, I must allow, was in part cheated, or led astray by <hi rend="italic">you</hi>). “P.F.’s” letter shews the writer to be a man of trained mind, of calm clear thought,—one capable of taking up a subject and pursuing it closely to its logical conclusion;—in every respect so very different from “Alpha.” And that “L.K.” has also written truthfully and plainly, and feelingly, and that without any apparent low designed or insidious sneering, which so cleaves to “Alpha,” and of which, strive as he may, he cannot wholly divest himself.</p>
         <p>Long as this letter already is, I must be allowed to make a further remark or a letter from the Teacher of Kaikoura School (Mr Crawford), which also appeared against me in your paper. Two things, if I recollect aright, (for I first saw the said letter in the “Forty-mile Bush,”) Mr Crawford charged me with: first. <hi rend="italic">Lying</hi>:—in his denying the truthfulness of what I had said (in a few words) in my Official letter to the Board respecting his removing to the Woodville School.  On this direct denial of this I say nothing; only that, notwithstanding the same, some may continue to believe me, and some may choose to believe him. But if it were so that his heart was always so set on the Woodville School, how came it to pass, hat he had secretly made every arrangement last October with the Trustees of the United Methodist School here in Napier, to have their School? and from which he was only, and that at the last moment when he came to Napier to sign the agreement, dissuaded by me from carrying into effect.—Where was Mr Crawford’s thought of Woodville School then? 2nd.<hi rend="italic">Stealing</hi>: which Mr Crawford (in his sad “murthering” of Shakespeare) also charges me with—</p>
         <p>“Filching from him his good name” (!) Bless the man! How? when? where? and in what way? I would ask. It is true, I openly and officially, in doing my duty, told the Board,—that I did not consider Mr Crawford a fit person to be removed from Kaikoura School to Woodville School, to have the charge of the School there. And why? (1) Because the people of Woodville had informed me, that they had 50–60 (in one letter, 70–80) children ready for school. Hence (2.) I was seeking to get a good A.1, trained Teacher, with, if possible, a trained female Teacher as wife, for that large and growing School. (3.) For Mr Crawford is not a trained Teacher (though a good writer and accountant, at home in a quiet office,) neither has he the physical strength to stand the daily wear and tear of a heavy school,—to say nothing of want of quickness and of tact in getting through those daily duties;—then Mr Crawford has a large family mostly of small children, and his wife, poor lady, an invalid. Indeed, Mr Crawford had also told me, when he was so desirous a short time ago of returning to Napier to take charge of the U. Methodist School, that “one of his reasons was, to be near to a medical man on account of Mrs Crawford.” (Perhaps Mr Crawford may find it convenient to forget, or even to <hi rend="italic">deny</hi> this, also?) However, I, for my part, am quite willing to “bide-a-wee,” and let Time (the great revealer) show, who was right in the matter of a <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> Teacher for the rising generation at Woodville School. It may be that the old, old, story, of trying to serve two masters, will be found to have had much to do with it. Be all that as it may, Mr Crawford must very well know, that in my late Yearly Reports, and in my visiting his School at Kaikoura, and in all my connection with him, I have ever sought publicly and privately to do him ample justice; just the very opposite (I should think,) of “Filching his good name”!! But, because Mr Crawford under all his disadvantages could manage a small school of little children in a settled quiet village like Kaikoura,—it surely does not follow that he could get along so well with the bigger school of rough lads in the new Bush Settlement of Woodville—</p>
         <p>I purposely abstain from making any comment on the sly Pecksniffian under handed mode of proceeding in that affair; this, too, will be better understood by-and-by.—I am, &amp;c.,	<lb/>
