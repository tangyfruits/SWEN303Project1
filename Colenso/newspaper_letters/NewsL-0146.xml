      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your issue of this evening you have the following item of news (mentioning the residence of the late Mr Alexander Kennedy). You say:—</p>
      <p>“The house at the foot of the Shakespeare-road was built by the late Mr Kennedy thirty years ago, on land that he bought from Renata. It was on the site of an old pah.” </p>
      <p>In this short sentence, as I view it, there are several errors. </p>
      <p>1. Mr Kennedy could not have bought the said piece of land from Renata, as Renata never possessed a foot of land in Scinde Island (now Napier.) </p>
      <p>2. The chiefs (owners) sold it in its entirety to the then Land Purchase Commissioner, Sir Donald McLean. There was no reserve. </p>
      <p>3. The said land was early laid off in town sections, as may be seen in the (old) Government map of the town. </p>
      <p>4. There was no “old pah” on that spot, but below—seaward from the hotel adjoining—there was a very small fishing village, only occasionally inhabited. </p>
      <p>Moreover, the law was such at that period (and for long after), that no European could possibly purchase land from a native chief. </p>
      <p>Alas! poor Renata! both living and dead, errors are foisted upon thee! —I am, &amp;c., </p>
      <p rend="end">WIILIAM COLENSO.            </p>
