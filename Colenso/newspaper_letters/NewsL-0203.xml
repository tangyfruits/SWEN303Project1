                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your paper of this morning you have a short local on the strange animal lately seen near Gisborne, in which you bring me forward as saying (to your informant) that “In the absence of fuller particulars I believed it to be one of the large lizards mentioned in Cook’s voyages.” That, however, is but a small portion of what I said to him, and not (perhaps) the most likely hypothesis of the several mentioned by me. However, I should not care to write about it now, only for another error in the same notice, namely, that by Captain Hutton. I told your informant (seeing that the moa—of celebrity—was also prominently brought forward in your account of the said animal from Gisborne) that it was likely the mythical <hi rend="italic">saurian</hi>, or monstrous lizard, formerly stated by the old Maoris to be the moa’s guard, at its cave, on the top of the mountain Whakapunake. I now quote briefly from my first early paper on the moa, containing mention of the said fabulous lizard; and also of other real living Maori ones, as obtained by me from the old tohunga Maoris more than 60 years ago. </p>
         <p>“During the summer of 1838, while at Waiapu, East Cape, I heard from the Maoris of a certain monstrous animal, called a <hi rend="italic">moa</hi>:—that it dwelt in a cavern on the precipitous side of a mountain,—that it lived on air,—and that it was guarded by two immense <hi rend="italic">tuataras</hi>, who, argus-like, kept incessant watch, while the moa slept; also, that if anyone ventured to approach the dwelling of this wonderful creature, he would be invariably trampled on and killed by it. A mountain named Whakapunake, at least 80 miles distant in a southerly direction, was spoken of as the residence of this creature; there, however, only one existed, which, it was generally contended, was the lair of its race.” (I here omit a great deal more said of the moa; and give a portion of a note from the same paper on the <hi rend="italic">tuatara</hi>—then, also, unknown to science,) </p>
         <p>“The tuatara, a saurian,—is common in some parts of New Zealand, particularly on rocky headlands, and islets lying off the coast. I have one at present in spirits, which I had alive for nearly three of the winter months; during which time, although I repeatedly tried to get it to take some kind of food, I could not succeed. From its habits I supposed it to be a hybernating animal. It measured 19 inches in length, &amp;c., &amp;c., and appeared a perfectly harmless creature. It was taken, with two others, (also possessed by me,) on Karewa Island, off Tauranga harbour, Bay of Plenty,” </p>
         <p>“The natives speak of another species, possessing a forked tail; and assert that a larger species, which inhabits swampy places, has been seen 6 feet in length, and as thick as a man’s thigh. The largest, however, that I have ever known did not measure above 2 feet in length.” (<hi rend="italic">Tasmanian Journal of Natural Science</hi>, vol. II, p.81. Published under the kind auspices of the lamented Sir John Franklin, then Governor of Tasmania.) </p>
         <p>Then, as to Captain Hutton’s remark, as given by you—that the large animal lately seen near Gisborne was a <hi rend="italic">tuatara</hi>, a specimen having been obtained near Auckland, &amp;c., this could not be; from the fact of this strange animal having been called by them a “<hi rend="italic">kumi</hi>”—the name of the mythical big lizard—the companion or guard of the moa. No Maori would, or could, have confounded that scarce monstrous creature with the small and well-known tuatara. Possibly, with your permission, I may have a little more to say on this subject. I await, however, further news re the kumi from Gisborne, hoping it may not prove to be a hoax!</p>
         <p>It is, perhaps, worth mentioning that the name <hi rend="italic">kumi</hi>, given to this big lizard, is the proper name for their measure of <hi rend="italic">ten fathoms.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">This</hi> serves to join it on to those cleverly constructed legends of those immense saurians as related by the ancient Maoris; translations of the same are given by me in vol. XII., “Transactions N.Z. Institute.—I am, &amp;c., </p>
