                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In your two papers of yesterday and to-day (22nd and 23rd inst.) your country correspondents have told us of a piece of decaying wood which is singularly phosphorescent, and much seems to be made of it—as if such was a very remarkable or rare production. Whereas such luminous substances are by no means uncommon, and to be met with all over the globe, both on land, in the ocean, and in the several kingdoms of Nature—zoological, vegetable, and mineral; also, in both living and dead states in the animal kingdom, and very common: Witness, the glow worms living, and mackerel and the sea jellies (<hi rend="italic">Medusa</hi> sps.) dead in our own native land in the summer season. Indeed, “fish abiding in the dark,” in a certain incipient state of decomposition is well known. </p>
         <p>And, as I have not infrequently met with such luminous vegetable substances (decaying woods) in my former travelling days and sojournings in our New Zealand forests, it seems strange that old settlers living in the Bush (or interior) should not have often noticed them, especially in certain seasons when the low forests are damp after rains. At such times and in such places I have seen some curious, strange, and weird-like appearances; one in particular, though seen 50 years ago, I shall never forget. </p>
         <p>We were travelling from Ngaawapurua, a village on the Manawatu River, towards Wairarapa; the weather had been wet and hindered us, and we started late in the day for the village of Te Hawera, situate in the dense and long forest; I wishing to get there, if possible, that night, as the next day was Sunday, and I knew the isolated and scattered Maoris would be assembled, awaiting me. We were soon benighted in the deep gloom of the forest. I had travelled through those forests before, but there was no proper or continuous track. We had taken with us junks of a dry large woody creeper which burnt steadily and slowly when ignited, to serve as a kind of lantern; as the night advanced the darkness of the ancient and close virgin forest became almost palpable and “Egyptian,” when we got into a broken mass of phosphorescence, arising from decaying wood and large <hi rend="italic">fungi</hi>, which spread out on all sides and extended many chains! The luminosity was grand, clearly showing the trunks and stems and leaves of trees and ferns, and the dead unshapely prostrate rotting logs. But the peculiar pale colors of various hues of that strange light, together with the coldnes of those gleams, and the deep silence, and the Stygian blackness surrounding—altogether caused an unpleasant unearthly kind of thought and feeling—almost causing one’s flesh to creep! We (or I) could fancy all manner of strange outrageous and mocking spectral or demon faces, more suited for the revelry of Faust’s Walpurgis night, with Mephistopheles and the witches on the Brocken, than for a small and quiet party plodding our way through a low-lying New Zealand forest. My travelling party of Maoris had never before witnessed any such a scene, and often in after years related it. Our travelling slow match, with its red light and sparks, was paled and lost before that grand phosphorescent show. Sometimes streaks and small patches of luminous slime would adhere for a while to my clothing in passing through the forest. Only on one other occasion did I ever witness a similar large display of natural cold and pale light, or sheets of lambent flames, issuing from the earth, and that too, was by night, at the time of the great earthquake in the 60s, through which I could see the trunks of trees, &amp;c. This, however, was of a very different nature. I am, &amp;c., </p>
