         <p>(Per favour Editor <hi rend="smallcaps">H.B. Herald</hi>.), To the Rev. Wm. Baumber , Napier. </p>
         <p>Dear Sir,—</p>
         <p>Permit an entire stranger to thank you thus openly for those very excellent and truthful words uttered by you last evening as Chairman at the Anniversary of your Wesleyan Church Sunday School: as reported in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Hawke’s Bay Herald</hi> of this morning. May they be generally made known through out the Colony, and may the Divine blessing attend them!— </p>
         <p>You, sir, in those few plain and honest words have really struck at the root of the whole matter. (I call it <hi rend="italic">on</hi> a single root.) As concerning the proper use of the Bible, (the not making a senseless reasonless <hi rend="italic">fetish</hi> of it, as if it contained spells and charms!) the Home duties of parents,—the Government Day Schools,—the Sunday Schools,—the true cause of growing Larrikanism among us,—and the fearful fruits thereof in the near future, unless timely and reasonably met and suppressed.— </p>
         <p>Again do I heartily thank you for this expression of your honest convictions; I do so, as an old Sunday School Teacher, as a Protestant Minister, as a Parent, and as a Colonist—earnestly desiring the welfare of the Country; and I would that more, nay <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, of our Working Protestant Ministers could thus think with you, and so act together in cordial concert. </p>
         <p>			I am, Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>				Yours truly</p>
         <p>
