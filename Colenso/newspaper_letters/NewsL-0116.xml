      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—In a sub-article in your paper of this morning you again repeat, aud that more strongly and offensively than before, your old charge against me about Stamford-street. You say— “This is the petition got up by Mr Colenso, in aid of his private scheme for securing part of Stamford-street for himself.” </p>
      <p>Now I had fully replied in your paper of Feb. 23 to your first statement of this kind, wholly denying that I had anything to do with that petition; affirming “that I knew nothing of it, never even once heard of it,” and so I say now. And at that same time Mr Robjohns did the same, in a letter in your columns, and that without seeing me. Why then do you again bring forward this charge against me? Adding thereto what is just as false, namely,—that I have a “private scheme for securing part of Stamford street for myself,” So far as I know I have no “private scheme.” The little that I have done or said, I have done openly and publicly, both in your paper (with your permission), and in my two short letters to the Municipal Council. </p>
      <p>Why then, I ask, do you reiterate this falsity? which I have so plainly and fully denied. If you (alone) will not believe what I have said, act the manly part and show your proofs, your authority, in support of your repeated assertions; or, failing to do so, acknowledge your error, and cease foolishly throwing editorial mud—that is unworthy of your paper.—I am, &amp;c, </p>
