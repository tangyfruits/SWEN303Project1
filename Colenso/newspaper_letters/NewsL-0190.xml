      <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Recently, while in the Bush district, I saw a notice in your paper (August 28<hi rend="sup ">th</hi>) of the death of Mrs Mary Ann Henderson, of Napier, aged 82; “said to have been the first white woman who came to Hawke’s Bay.” At first sight I knew this to be an error—and a great one; and I determined to write to you about it; but a very serious cold, and, also, wishing to make enquiries concerning her arrival, have hitherto prevented me.</p>
      <p>And now I write, merely (1) to <hi rend="italic">deny </hi>her being the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>white woman who came to Hawke’s Bay; and (2) to state, that there were several here before her, some of whom still remain among us.</p>
      <p>One intelligent old settler of 43 years residence in Hawke’s Bay, to whom I had also written for information respecting her arrival among us, in his reply, laughs at the outrageous statement made by you and says,— “there were dozens here before her!”</p>
      <p>If this error were not cotrrected by <hi rend="italic">one who knows</hi>; no doubt, in days to come, your statement concerning her arrival here would be strenuously brought forward as a true one.—I am, &amp;c.,</p>
      <p>
        <hi rend="smallcaps">William Colenso</hi>
