         <p>“I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.” </p>
         <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—The plain striking and truthful remarks in your paper of yesterday (Monday), from “an occasional contributor,”—on the Hotel question at Makatoku,—seem to call on me to say a few words in support of them; that is, of the principal facts which he brings forward. Seeing, that I, too, happen to know a little concerning that matter, and the real want, of the whole large Bush district. For I have been both residing and travelling about within it certainly more than 3 months of the past year (and so in former years), and in my doing so have both used my eyes and ears and thought in connection with this subject. </p>
         <p>“Contributor” is quite right when he states—that <hi rend="italic">more drinking</hi> has taken place in that locality during the past 12 months, since all the four hotels were at once and suddenly closed by the Licensing Committee, than during the 12 months preceding, when they were all open: Mr Rechab Harding to the contrary, notwithstanding. </p>
         <p>In my opinion the Licensing Committee of 1884 did a great wrong to the Public—and particularly to the <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi> public—by so closing all those hotels; they might have lessened their number, leaving, say, 2,—one on each line of road (Coach &amp; Train) for the benefit of the public. </p>
         <p>Not unfrequently during my repeated and rather long sojournings there, and especially when travelling, as I almost daily do for several miles along the great highway and <hi rend="italic">only</hi> coach road between Napier and Wellington, have I met with travellers, strangers,—of all grades,—some on foot and some riding, who have enquired, where they could get refreshment,—or <hi rend="italic">suitable</hi> accommodation? and what could I say?</p>
         <p>It is all very well for those who are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> travellers, or who are <hi rend="italic">interested</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">monetarily</hi> (whether in their little shops, or in church and Sectarian matters,) or who are <hi rend="italic">rabid teetotallers</hi>, for them to say— “Oh! there is such and such an Accommodation House!” (I only know of 2 within 60, or more, miles.) And, for several good and valid reasons that I could state, and which even reasonable teetotallers would readily allow,—I say, that those 2 Houses are not really good and suitable accommodation, for the present travelling public. Possibly, in years gone by, they were such, but present wants and requirements need something more, something better, or, at all events, more suitable. </p>
         <p>For instance: I would take a teetotaller—the most unreasonable and selfish and monomaniac among them, a positive “one-idea” man, whom I will call John,—and I would ask him, if journeying and stopping necessarily through heavy rain at a teetotal accommodation house in the Bush,— “What do you take for supper, John, Tea or Coffee?” “Oh!” he might reply, “Coffee; for I never take Tea, as it always gives me a headache, and prevents me from sleeping.” “Ah! yes, very good, John, but there is no Coffee here, and none to be had nearer than Napier.” Now, I feel sure, that John, or Bill, teetotaller, would not like to hear that. But there is no help for it; either Tea (the Bush Teetotal-Accommodation house Tea! Ugh!!) or cold water! And so, again, on getting up in the morning, and, it may be, starting afresh in the rain—with his cold comfort! Still, such might only be for a single night, and so could be borne; but what if such continued for a week or more? </p>
         <p>Again:—as I lately put it to one of my Scandinavian acquaintances, who had donned the <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of Blue, and who is a religiously-disposed man:— “You smoke, I think?” “Yes, I do;” was the reply. “Well,” I rejoined, “I don’t, and I do not like tobacco; and I believe, with many others, that tobacco is much more hurtful to our rising generation than strong drink. Suppose we (my party) were to combine, and not caring for the comfort and requirements of the larger number or our fellow-men, were to get a law passed prohibiting the use of tobacco; How would you like that?” “Oh! not at all,” he replied “that would never do; that would be very unfair; we would not submit to it; in fact we could not live without tobacco.” “Ah! yes,” I said, “that will do; I have it from your own mouth. And you are a Christian! a follower of Him whose principal tenet was,— ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’”—</p>
         <p>Now, just so, as I take it, is it with a man who needs his glass of Beer, or of Wine, or of Spirits; all, too, made from different material, and of various sorts and kinds to please tastes, and suit the natural requirements of man. Why should a man (any man) not be able to obtain in a free country what he really needs? I, myself, have met with cases up in that big bush, during the last 10–12 years, in which my having a little good Brandy with me (for my own private use, if required,) has proved of great service,—among others to poor half-dying teetotallers in the times of their greatest need, with no Doctor nor medicine near, and all spirituous liquors condemned by them as “an accursed thing.” Not, however, that they (many of them) really believed it. No, no; they had been talked over, and in a time of excitement, and led by others, had agreed for the nonce to become teetotallers: and now the sure consequence was, that there were no really good and useful spirituous liquors handy, or to be had! </p>
         <p>I do not wish, Mr Editor, to make this letter too long, and so I cut it short; merely making two remarks which naturally arise from the past and present state of things up in the Bush. </p>
         <p>1. That, seeing that there is no hotel on the long and almost dreary line of highway of more than 40 miles, and the only road, between Waipawa and Daneverke, (over which all stock—often “mobs” of sheep each containing many thousands—have to be slowly driven in all kinds of weather,) that the new Licensing Committee will see their way reasonably clear to grant a License to one hotel on that long, line of road; and, also, to one hotel upon the Railway line through the Bush, which is also greatly needed. For, (as I showed in a letter in your columns about a year ago,) really good hotels, kept by suitable people, and furnished with pure and proper drinks of all kinds in use among us, (not adulterated trash which is poison!)—under also the lawful supervision of the police—such would prove to be a great means of bringing more money into those at present poor parts, and therefore a great blessing to that Country, and particularly beneficial to the travelling public,—of whom I am one. </p>
         <p>2. That should the new Licensing Committee, in their carrying-out of their legal powers so strain them as to refuse to allow of any hotels in all that extensive and scattered District,—that then, I think, a reasonable and strong public movement should be at once made, to remove the Court-House at Ormondville from is present unsuitable site in the Bush to Takapau on the adjoining plain,—where there is a Hotel, and where professional men and their clients and witnesses, and Magistrates, too, and Jurors, and the Public generally attending the sittings of the Court, could have their reasonable and needful wants and refreshments supplied, and no longer be bamboozled and hampered and oppressed by an insignificant minority. And so leave all that Bush and its Bush Villages to their inhabitants and to their loved quietude and isolation,—until they should “come to themselves,” and see and put away their selfish error. </p>
         <p>And this removal of that Court-House to a more suitable place for the public benefit, I think, could be easily brought about, as such would not come under “Local Option,” and would be supported by an overwhelming majority.—I am, &amp;c, </p>
