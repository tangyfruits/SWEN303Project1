                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>,—Of late the people of the Colony have been exercised not a little over insanity. Not that it has ever been wanting among us, in some one of its many and varied forms, as we ourselves know here, and as your notes of proceedings in the R.M. Court too frequently inform us. Its numerous Protean phases are often so subtle and so strange, and so very very small in their origin, as to elude the lengthened examination of the most skilful. Some medical men of experience and high standing in their profession have put it on record, that almost every man is mad at some time or other of his life; and from what I have read and observed during a number of years I am inclined to believe it. Indeed, I am even now obliged, in charity to some of my old Colonial acquaintances, to hold strongly to this conclusion; otherwise I can not account for some of their unreasonable sayings and doings,—their crazy, cracked, and reasonless views and utterances—more especially those who labour under some unattainable “fad” as Teetotalism and Blue-Ribbonism on the brain— </p>
         <p>“They rant, recite, and madden round the land!”</p>
         <p>Shakespeare, our great British delineator of human character under many and strange guises, frequently brings madness prominently forward, and that in a great number of forms,—from the mild and playful to the raging type, including also the simulated form; as when <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> says,— “I am but mad north-north-west; when the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a hand-saw;” or “the mad-brained bridegroom” Petruchio, with his,— “Be mad and merry,—or go hang yourselves.” From Shakespeare’s frequent and varied uses and modes of madness, we may reasonably infer, that the malady was then, just as it is now, common enough in his time.</p>
         <p>The unhappy man Donoghue, who was executed last Wednesday morning at Hokitika for the murder of Gifford, was (when placed on his trial some months ago) supposed to be insane. The Judge directed a Jury to hear and decide. Dr Hector, and Dr King the surgeon of the hospital there, examined the prisoner, and immediately and in the strongest manner pronounced him insane; the Jury however wanted further evidence; and four other medical men examined the prisoner, who all refused to say he was insane! consequently the trial proceeded, resulting in a verdict of guilty. It seems, that the population of the West Coast was greatly excited over those proceedings; first the murder of Gifford,—second the steps taken to prove the murderer insane,—and third the long delay. It seems, too, that the Government was in doubt, for, at length Dr. Grabham was sent by them to examine the convict. However, Donoghue was at last hung; and the several medical men, no doubt, still hold to their opposite opinions respecting him.</p>
         <p>I have very recently been reading, in the London Standard newspaper, a remarkable case of a most serious charge of insanity brought against a talented lady, Mrs. Weldon, by her own husband, who had employed that eminent and noted physician, (especially in such cases,) Dr. Forbes Winslow. Dr. Winslow had certified her to be mad, in the usual way, and she was about to be consigned to the Doctor’s own (or to his mother-in-law’s) Asylum, at the nice little figure of £10 l0s a week, when she fortunately made her escape! (At that time her allowance from her husband was £1000 a year: she having, also, property of her own.) And now Mrs. Weldon brings an action against Dr. Forbes Winslow, for libel, and assault and false imprisonment, and £10,000 damages. The trial is a celebrated one, and that for many reasons; one prominent reason being this, that Mrs. Weldon nobly and cleverly conducted her own case in the Court of Queen’s Bench, without any assistance from Counsel, before Mr Baron Huddleston and a special Jury. The trial lasted 6 days and was most interesting throughout: the Court being densely packed each day.</p>
         <p>The lady examines and cross-examines a large number of witnesses on both sides, including Dr. Winslow and his own medical associates of high standing, and her own husband. Dr. Winslow cut but a sorry figure in her hands, although his Counsel (2) took his part; now and then he appealed to the Judge, who told him, he must answer the question. I suppose he never experienced such an examination before, extending through two days. The Judge, however, was obliged legally to nonsuit her; although in his summing up he spoke largely in her favour, and most strongly against the present horrible practice of entrapping supposed or charged lunatics, that is carried out by Doctors under the law of England. It is worthy of observation, that, owing to this very trial, it has already been moved in the House of Lords, to amend the lunacy law.</p>
         <p>A part of Mrs Weldon’s examination of Dr James Edmunds, M.D., F.R.C.P., and of his answers, is so peculiar, so new in a Court of Justice, that it is well worthy a place in your columns,—as causing food for thought. She also put similar questions to Dr Winslow, who gave similar answers.</p>
         <p>Dr Edmunds,— “I am a doctor of medicine, and member of the Royal College of Physicians. I have had a full experience in cases of insanity.... I examined Mrs Weldon for 3 hours,—and upon the whole I came to the conclusion, my lord, that she was right, and as sane as she appears to be to-day.”</p>
         <p>Re-examined by Mrs Weldon, “I take it you are not a Spiritualist?—Certianly not.</p>
         <p>You know that there is a great difference between mediums?—I have heard so.</p>
         <p>And, that there 46 million Spiritualists?—I never heard it put so high as that. There are a great many men who are Spiritualists.</p>
         <p>“John Wesley was a medium and heard voices; should you say he was crazy?—No.</p>
         <p>St. Paul, when he went down to persecute the Christians, heard a voice saying, “Why persecutest thou Me.” Now, should you consider that St. Paul was a crazy person? (loud laughter,)—I am afraid I should have to say that he was in a little crazy condition.</p>
         <p>Do you think Balaam was out of his mind when be heard his ass speak?—I think he must have been a little crazy (laughter).</p>
         <p>Then there was Joan of Arc. Was she crazy? A little, I think.</p>
         <p>Have you heard the story of Stokes, who gave evidence in the case of Harriet Lane, murdered by the Wainwrights, saying that he heard a voice saying, “Follow that cab?”—I should say that that was not craziness. It was an instantaneous act, and a kind of unaccountable impression.</p>
         <p>Because I said, when I heard in Paris that my husband was selling my furniture, a voice told me to go back, should you say I was mad?—No; I should say it was a kind of automatic cerebration. Persons in a state of mental excitement may see something of stars before their eyes. It is common in slight cases of fever.</p>
         <p>Mrs Weldon.—I am a Spiritualist, and do not believe in mad doctors; but I do believe in spirits, which are much less harmless.” (Laughter).</p>
         <p>Dr. Edmunds having also, in reply to Dr. Winslow’s Counsel, spoken of both crazy and insane persons;—</p>
         <p>“Mr Baron Huddleston.—What is the distinction?</p>
         <p>Witness. A person might be crazy, but not of sufficiently unsound mind to be locked up in a lunatic asylum.—Sir Isaac Newton fancied he was a teapot.”</p>
         <p>Great applause in Court followed Mrs Weldon’s last address, which the Judge put a stop to.— </p>
         <p>In his summing up, his Lordship said:— “I must express my astonishment that such a state of things can exist, that an order can be made by anybody on the statement of anybody, and that two gentlemen if they have only obtained a diploma,—through them any person can be committed to a lunatic asylum. It is startling,—it is positively shocking, that if a pauper, or as Mrs Wedon put it, a crossing sweeper, should sign an order and another crossing sweeper should make a statement, and that then two medical men, who had never had a day’s practice in their lives, should for a small sum of money grant their certificates, a person may be lodged in a private lunatic asylum.  .  .  .  I am bound to say, that having seen Mrs Weldon’s demeanour throughout this case I, speaking as a layman and not as a doctor, consider she is in the full possession of her senses, and has conducted her case with judgment, intelligence and talent,” &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, I would remark, that Gloster’s deep saying at the head of this paper is well worthy of consideration at the present time. For craziness is rampant just now. The poet Dryden has also a suitable observation in one of his plays, highly applicable here;</p>
         <p>	———“There is a pleasure</p>
         <p>In being mad which none but madmen know”;</p>
         <p>and this, I think, belongs to senior wranglers and medallist Teetotallers.<note xml:id="ftn47" place="foot" n="47"> Colenso, the senior wrangler, confesses his pleasure in being as mad as his teetotal opponents! A correspondent (“Madman”) missed the point  in an unpleasantly sarcastic response in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> of 19 June—<hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>
                  </note>—I am, &amp;c.,</p>
