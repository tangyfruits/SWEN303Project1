      <p>Napier’s grand old man, the Rev. W. Colenso, occupied the pulpit at the Ormondville Anglican Church on Sunday morning last, and preached a very interesting sermon of a very orthodox nature. There was a good attendance to listen to his remarks, and the hearing accorded him was most appreciative. During the course of his remarks he took occasion to bestow a well-deserved compliment on the playing of the organist, Mr J. Scholes.<hi rend="italic"> </hi>
