		<body>
			<p>Wellington 28 Sept. 68 </p>
			<p>My dear Sir </p>
			<p>I am in receipt of yours of the 14th. in reference to the printing of the Essay on the Maories. </p>
			<p>I will do what I can in the matter, it ought to be printed at the Govt. Press. Everything of interest respecting the race should be preserved and circulated among those who take an interest in such subjects. </p>
			<p>I will get a Crusoe to take down with me as I am not sure whether I have one at home. </p>
			<p>You see I have been having a fight the Govt. on Defence and native matters, both are lamentably conducted, facts have come under my notice respecting the conduct of these officers of which I was quite unconscious until lately and which I refrain from making use of in the present state of the country. </p>
			<p>The treatment of Hawkes Bay opened my eyes to the danger of allowing such men to go on unchecked. I think the Rarawa native will only get a short sentence. </p>
			<p>Excuse this hasty epistle. </p>
			<p>Yours very truly </p>
			<p>Donald McLean </p>
			<p>If I can do anything for you in <!--correction to eColenso typo supplied by Ian St G, 20.11.15-->Wellington let me know. </p>
			<!--* Tawake, a man of Te Rarawa iwi, was being tried for murder. -->
