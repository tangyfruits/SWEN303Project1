			<p>Napier 7 Sept 65. </p>
			<p>My dear Sir </p>
			<p>I am exceedingly obliged for the information conveyed in your private letter of the 1st. inst. </p>
			<p>Native affairs on the East coast are assuming a very serious aspect and it is necessary to be prepared at all points for any thing that may occur. </p>
			<p>The month of August was all along spoken of by the Hauhaus the 18 &amp; 28 of that month as the time for a general attack. I see your correspondent writes on the 24th. So that no doubt he was under the impression at the time that the August prophecies might be fulfilled. </p>
			<p>Yesterday some of Karaitiana’s people threatened to pull down a hui or Hauhau flag of Paora Noinoi’s, you know what that would lead to. I have warned Karaitiana not to precipitate hostilities and I think matters will be quiet here for a time. </p>
			<p>I remain </p>
			<p>my dear Sir </p>
			<p>yours faithfully </p>
			<p>Donald McLean. </p>
