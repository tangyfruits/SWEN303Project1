			<p>My dear Sir, </p>
			<p>Your correspondence relating to the Maori dictionary was laid upon the table. I was giving notice to have it produced when Richmond told me it had been already done. </p>
			<p>Ormond at your request asked me to do this. </p>
			<p>I had some trouble in getting a “Ropitini Kuruho”, and at last I had to borrow the Library copy, when I discovered that Mr. Lyon had one which he will lend if necessary. I went to all kinds of places in search of one. </p>
			<p>I send you a Pilgrim’s Progress. </p>
			<p>With reference to your essay on the Maori I had a hurried perusal of it and consider it a valuable contribution. I made the following remarks upon it in a letter to Hector. </p>
			<p>“I am much obliged for the perusal of Mr. Colenso’s essay on the Maori. I consider it is well worthy of publication, and hope you will get it printed.” I first asked Richmond about it, and he referred me to Dr. Hector. </p>
			<p>very truly yours </p>
			<p>Donald McLean. </p>
			<p>16 Octr. 1868 </p>
			<p>Please return Hector’s note. </p>
			<!--Editor's notes: Ropitini Kuruho = Robinson Crusoe; *James Hector had written to McLean    about Colenso’s essay on 13 October (#1020017). -->
