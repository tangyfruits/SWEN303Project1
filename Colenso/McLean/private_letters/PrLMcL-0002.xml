			<p>1851 January 13 McLean to Colenso (#1017611) </p>

		<body>
			<p>My dear Sir. </p>
			<p>The Brig in the Bay is a Hobart town whaler 3 months out, one sperm whale. Left Auckland on the 4th. of last month, no news. Mr. Ankatell says that he does not suppose there will be any difficulty about sending the Rose to Uawa, although he cannot take upon himself to send her without the Masterâ€™s consent who he will consult when he arrives here. </p>
			<p>I send you Mayor Mitchells 2 vols. and return with thanks the Tasmanian Journal. </p>
			<p>I intend to take a sail over to Wakaari this forenoon if it does not blow too fresh. </p>
			<p>With kind respects to Mrs. Colenso &amp; the tamariki. </p>
			<p>I remain </p>
			<p>My dear Sir</p>
			<p> Yours very sincerely</p>
			<p> Donald McLean.</p>
			<p> Monday </p>
			<p>Jany 13. 1851. </p>
			<p>There is a small kaipuke in sight, a boat has gone off to enquire what she is. Should she bring any letters for you I will send a boy with them tomorrow. </p>
