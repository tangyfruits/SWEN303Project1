			<p>My dear Sir, </p>
			<p>I have read with much interest your letter of the 14th. inst., and feel much obliged to you for sending it. </p>
			<p>The Ngapuhi representative will keep the Northern tribes fully advised. He is a very sensible intelligent man. I should have liked very much to have seen Henri Mohiâ€™s letter; as his knowledge of the working of the Native Land Court is considerable. </p>
			<p>I shall be glad to hear from you when you can spare time to write; and I hope that the rheumatic attack with which you were afflicted when I was at Hawkes Bay has disappeared. If you would like a trip to the Hot Springs at Rotorua, I should be very glad to give you a passage to Maketu, and a horse and guide on to the Lakes. </p>
			<p>Hoping you will excuse this short epistle,  </p>
			<p>I remain,  </p>
			<p>Yours very truly, (Signed)  </p>
			<p>Donald McLean. </p>
			<p>29 Septr. 1871 </p>
