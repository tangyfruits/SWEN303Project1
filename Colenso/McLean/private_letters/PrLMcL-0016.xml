		<body>
			<p>Napier Decr. 23rd. 1862. </p>
			<p>Dear Sir </p>
			<p>In reply to your letter of the 11th ult. enclosing extracts of Bishop Williams’ communication to the Govt. respecting Waitangi. </p>
			<p>I have to state that I know nothing whatever of the circumstances referred to in the latter paragraph of his Lordship’s comm. as I do not remember that I had any conversation with you at the time about Waitangi. </p>
			<p>Respecting the raupo cottage in which you were living after your house was burnt I can only say that it was a well constructed substantial native building, well floored, and the interior was neatly lined with kakaho and altogether the best cottage of the description then in the district. </p>
			<p>I remain </p>
			<p>My dear Sir </p>
			<p>Your very truly </p>
			<p>Donald McLean. </p>
