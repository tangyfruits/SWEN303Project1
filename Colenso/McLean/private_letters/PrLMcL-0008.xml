			<p>Monday afternoon </p>
			<p>Dear Mr. Colenso </p>
			<p>I have to thank you for the form which is filled up quite correctly. I have now the whole returns of Hawkes Bay excepting the Wairoa and te Mahia which must be taken at some other time. </p>
			<p>By the Rose the Governor has sent me instructions to investigate the old Land claims at Poverty Bay and it is probable that I may go there from Mohaka, however if possible I shall ride over for an hour or so to see you before starting. </p>
			<p>As a married man I find it not quite so agreeable to make such long excursions but duty must be attended to. By last letters from Wellington Mrs McLean was rather complaining and her mother being unwell so that I feel rather anxious respecting them. </p>
			<p>Give my kindest regards to Mrs Colenso and believe me yours </p>
			<p>very sincerely </p>
			<p>Donald McLean </p>
			<p>Thanks for the lettuces. </p>
