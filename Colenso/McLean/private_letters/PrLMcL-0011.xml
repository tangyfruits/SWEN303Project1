			<p>January 10th. 53 </p>
			<p>My dear Sir,  </p>
			<p>I shall be glad if you can come this far tomorrow forenoon that the case of assault complained of by Wi Tipuna may be adjusted. I do not think the case will delay you very long and I regret exceedingly having occasion to request your attendance at a time when you have lost your comfortable house; at which I have received so many kind attentions, but I feel assured that you will feel sensible that nothing but a sense of duty would induce me at a time like this present to solicit your attendance. </p>
			<p>Yours very truly </p>
			<p>Donald McLean. </p>
			<!--Object #1015124 “Native deed, Missionary station, Waitangi” bears the same date: it is Wiremu Tipuna’s official complaint of assault against Colenso.-->
