		<body>
			<p>My dear Mr Colenso  </p>
			<p>Many thanks for yours of the first giving an account of the disagreeable floods &amp; other events at Heretaunga. </p>
			<p>I had a conversation with Sir George Grey about a mission station and reserve for your purposes towards which he seems very favorably disposed. </p>
			<p>Dr Sinclair often enquires for you and requested to be remembered to you when I should see you. Mr. Cole is shortly to be married to a widow lady lately arrived in the Colony. If all is well tomorrow I intend to get married myself to Miss Strang of this place, a young lady for whom I have for some time had an attachment. I hope that you will now consider my house your home when you visit Wellington. </p>
			<p>I regret exceedingly to hear that Mrs Colenso is not very well. With kind respects to her and love to Fanny &amp; Rati<!--ie. Latty--> I am </p>
			<p>my dear Mr Colenso </p>
			<p>Yours sincerely </p>
			<p>Donald McLean </p>
			<p>Wellington 27 Augt 51 </p>
			<p>I am not sure but I think I must leave for Ahuriri about the end of Septr. </p>
