		</front>
		<body>
			<p>Dear Mr Colenso </p>
			<p>I received yours of the 28th. ult. respecting the prisoners at Otago; and I have to thank you for your kind suggestions. </p>
			<p>When the Session is over, the whole subject of Native prisoners will be duly considered by the Executive. The subject has been one of anxious consideration to the Government. </p>
			<p>I need not assure you that my reply to Mr. Gillies, in reference to the Lexicon, was not by any means spoken in a tone that could have given you the slightest annoyance, had you been present. </p>
			<p>Mr. Ormond is going down, and will give you all the news. </p>
			<p>I remain,  </p>
			<p>Yours very truly, </p>
			<p>(Signed)  Donald McLean. </p>
			<p>August 8th. 1870.  </p>
