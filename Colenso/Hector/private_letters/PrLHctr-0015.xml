            <p>18th May 1883 </p>
            <p>My dear Hooker, </p>
            <p>Your letters of Feb. &amp; March both reached 
me in Auckland as the Govr. was there &amp; they were in his bag.
 I at once sent on the R. S. Paper re Colenso to Haast and asked him to
sign &amp; send on to Buller who is at
 Cambridge at present &amp; I also
 wrote to Buller to sign &amp;
return to you direct by this mail – 
so I hope you will get 
it without delay.  </p>
            <p>It is very kind to offer more Pamphlets which I can assure you will be very acceptable. The last lot you kindly sent us I had 
sorted out &amp; bound as far as possible. </p>
            <p>I have ------ a Ward Case packed for you 
with live Alpines that
 I have had in pots  established for three years – so they should carry! The lot I had in the Case for you about 6
mos. ago nearly all damped off. I thought it better
 to keep them for a few months to test them. 
            </p>
            <p>I have seen a lot of young Peek &amp; like him very much. He will give you all the N.Z.
news.</p>
            <p>Yours very truly</p>
            <p>James Hector. </p>
