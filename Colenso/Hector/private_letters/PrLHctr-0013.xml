            <p>
My dear Hooker,</p>
            <p> 
            I only received your Febry. letter with the 
seeds for Ludlam yesterday, as it had made 
two trips to Auckland and back. There is a chance of still catching the Suez mail so I write a 
few lines to thank you for sending the letter to the Geol. Magazine. 
It is just as well to have 
these things out. I could not stand Haast bullying Woods of Melbourne for quoting him as an exponent of a South Glacial Epoch. In the same Vol.
 of the Trans. of the R. Soc. of Victoria
that has Woods’ paper Vol. VI you will see in
 the Preface that Haasts first paper had 
disappeared?
 But Haast is a very good fellow in other respects – too good a great deal to 
spoil by ---- play such tricks 
unchallenged. He has been working hard at the Amuri for me &amp; 
has made a very fine collection of Saurian Remains &amp; associated fossils. It is very queer 
except a small species of Belemnite &amp; a large 
Trigonea (found also in 
Tertiary strata) and 
Inoceramus – all the shells have a very tertiary cut. Something very interesting to General Geol. Science will come out of it. </p>
            <p>
I have to hurry since I 
came from Auckland rearranging the N.Z. Collections &amp; 
throwing out duplicates. The 
fossils
 occupy 160 feet of floor cases
 4 ft. wide. The Catalogue
is in the printers hands &amp; the 
Illustrated Catalogue is advanced. By this mail you get Vol. II
of our Trans. It was too late for the 
Frisco
 mail.</p>
            <p>
With regards to Willy</p>
            <p>Yrs. affectionately </p>
            <p>
J Hector. </p>
            <p>
            Shall I communicate with Colenso?
 I dont think you would get him in if the Parsons or Missionary Societies have
 any power or influence. I will write 
at length next mail[?]. </p>
