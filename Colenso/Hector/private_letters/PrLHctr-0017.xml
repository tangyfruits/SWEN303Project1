      <p> Geological Survey N.Z., Wellington </p>
            <p>12th September 1884 </p>
            <p>My dear Hooker,</p>
            <p>I have just posted to Sir. Hry. Lefroy at 
the suggestion of our Govnr. Sir W. Jervois an 
application certificate for his election as F.R.S. I think few R.E. Officers have better earned the distinction so I venture to ask you to
 give his nomination your powerful support.</p>
            <p>I have your letter of June last re 
Cordylines
 before me – but I am much puzzled –
 in 
fact as much as you can be.
 The only point on which Kirk &amp; 
Colenso rely for distinguishing C. indivisa
 of N. &amp; S. Is. is the number of heads in the N. I. species, but of course that is no 
character at all. In fact I have
 seen quite as many many-headed specimens in the South as in 
the those [sic] locallities in the North where 
bruises by cattle &amp; axemen have not been an
efficient cause divarication. Still it is curious that 
the veins on the underside of all N. Is. 
specimens are green &amp; glaucous &amp; S. Is. species are red. We have have [sic] had both forms
in cultivation, but they die off in a most extraordinary manner after a few years &amp; never 
flower with us. I have now 
got a collection of all our 
Cordylines
 underweigh for you &amp; I 
enclose a small quantity of
 seed of the form of 
Cordyline indivisa
 that grows on Mt. Egmont. I
am getting another case of plants ready for you but it is very extraordinary how unfortunate we are in our shipments to Kew. Did you not get the 
Pisonia Saporta
[?] &amp; other rare seeds I sent you last year. I dont see any acknowledgment of them in the Report. <!--[Marginal note, 
other hand: Unable to trace these. W.W.]--> I put in some at the same time in my own 
greenhouse &amp; they all came up! The 
Pisonias
 are now 12 inches high.</p>
            <p>Ever Sincerely Yours</p>
            <p>James Hector.</p>
            <p>We get our plants out from 
home best when they are 
packed hard in a close box 
without glass! I am going to try this plan with yours.</p>
